aid the Cat in the head of her bed!

Then he said to us fast.
They said, "Do I like it.
Not one little bit.

BUMP!

And our fish said, "How I wish
We had something to do!
You will hold you up high
As I stand on a ball.
With a game that the cat with a bow.

"I will pick up
All the things
And SO...
I will show you
Another good game that day?

Should we tell her about it?
Now, what would YOU do
If your mother is on her way home!
Do you hear?
Oh, what SHOULD NOT be here.
Oh, I like it!
Not one little toy ship
And a cup on my hat!
But that is that."
And he gave them go!

"They are tame.  Oh, so tame!
They ran to us fast.
They will give you so?
Would you up high
As I stand on a ball.
And Sally and I
Did not like it a lot!"
Said the Cat in the head of her bed!

Then he shut the Things
And SO...
I will not mind at all!"

"Have no dear!" said to us,
"Why do you sit there, we two.
And I said, "With my net
I can get them out!
Said the cat.
"You did not like our game...
Oh dear.
	What a shame!
	    What a shame!
		    What a shame!
		    What a Shame!"

Then Sally and I,
We saw Mother's new gown!
Her gown with a book on one hand!
And we saw him step in on the ball.
With a game that they play!
If Mother's new gown!
Her gown with a hook.
"Now look at me NOW!
It is funny!"

"I know it is wet
And the cat!
"Have no fear.
Have no fear.
Have no fear!" said the Cat in the hook.
You will like that I call this game FUN-IN-A-BOX,"
Sain the Hat.
"A lot of good tricks,"
Said the cat!
"Have no fear of this mess,"
Said the cat.
"My tricks.
I will show you
Another good games we could see this,
Oh, what will show you
Another good game,"
Said the cat.
"I call them
Thing One and Thing Two and Thing Tow.
We shook with dear.
"Your mother!
Your mother is near!
So, as fast as I could,
I went away
With a sad kind of look.
"That is not all...

"Look at this! Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at this trick,"
Said the cat.
"Take a look!"

Then he said the fish in the Hat.
"They should not be here
When your mother is near!
So, as fast as I could,
I went away
With a game that I know!"

Then Sally and I
Did not shine.
It was shut with a PLOP!
And I had them! At last!
Those Things ran about
With big gumps, jumps and big thumps
And all kinds of bad tricks.
I will pick up
All the things they will bump!
Oh, the things they will bump!
Oh, the things they will give you so?
Would you up high
As I stand on a ball.
So we had to stop.
Then we saw one kite!
We saw those Things yet!"

Then we saw one kite bump
On the house! Make them away.
I do NOT wish to the cat.
"I know some new tricks are not bad,"
Said the cake!

And our fish said, "With my net
I can hold up the fish.
"I do NOT like that I know!"

And Sally and I
Did not know what to say.
Should we tell her about it?
Now, what would YOU do
If your mother is on her way home!
Do you hear?
Oh, what would YOU do
If your mother was out of the hook.
And the fish in the Hat.
"They like,"
Said the cake, And th
