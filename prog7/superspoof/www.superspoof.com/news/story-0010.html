<B>Tony Blair Admits to Smile-Enhancing Drug Usage</B>
<HR>
<IMG SRC="tonyblair.jpg" BORDER="1" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10" ALT="Tony Blair in his most serious photograph of recent years.">
<I>Friday, February 1, 2002 - London, England</I>
<P>
From 10 Downing Street today, comes the shocking admission from British Prime Minister Tony Blair that he in fact has used smile-enhancing drugs up until very recently.
<P>
Notorious British Tabloids have been making much of the issue for the past several months, but little attention was paid in the mainstream press until very recently.
<P>
It seems an insider in the Prime Minister's Office faxed a prescription request to a major press agency, seemingly by accident, instead of the Prime Minister's family physician.
<P>
The drug, trade-named <B>Smilotta</B>, was also used at one time by such celebrities as James Brown, The Dalai Lama, and Ernie from Sesame Street.
It is said to cause a tightening of the muscles on the outer edges of the mouth, thus forcing a smile even in the most dire of situations.
It is used very widely by many politicians during election campaigns, though most stop after a campaign, and few speak openly of it.
<P>
The press has suspected its use by the Prime Minister since September 11th, when he couldn't seem to stop smiling despite the horrible circumstances.
<P>
"We all thought it rather rude to be condemning terrorism, telling Americans how sorry we felt for them, yet having a huge grin pasted across his face the whole time," said one British reporter.
<P>
"The bloke hasn't frowned in years," said another reporter who has followed Blair's career since 1996, "we all thought he'd either taken a smile-enhancing drug, or his sex life was a lot better than ours."
<P>
The drug is perfectly legal in Great Britain.
<P>
Following these latest shocking revelations, the Labour Party of Great Britain has announced plans to withdraw its trademark application for Tony Blair's smile, and has removed most of his pictures from their website until they find one of him frowning.  Party archivists are currently working on this project, and hope to have some photos available by late next week.
