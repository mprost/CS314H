I keep getting these email's about how women are smarter, women are superior ... women are stronger. I won't bother to argue about that.  But I
will say, if they're so 
smart why can't they figure 
out these very simple
things about us men. 

<P>
Very simple rules to follow 
and we'll be loving and
content spouses. I've 
outlined 32 of them.

<P>
<B>Rules To Live Together By</B>

<OL>
<li>

Learn to work the 
toilet seat. If it's up, put it 
down. We need it up,
you need it down. You 
don't hear us complaining 
about you leaving it down.

<li>

If you won't dress like 
the Victoria's Secret girls, 
don't expect us
to act like soap opera 
guys.

<li>
If you think you're 
fat, you probably are. Don't 
ask us. We refuse to
answer.

<li>
Birthdays, Valentines, 
and Anniversaries are NOT 
quests to see if we  can
find the perfect present 
yet again!
<li>
If you ask a question 
you don't want an answer to, 
expect an answer you
don't want to hear. 
<li>
Sometimes, we're not 
thinking about you. Live with 
it.
<li>
Don't ask us what 
we're thinking about unless 
you are prepared to  discuss
such topics as navel lint, 
the shotgun formation, or 
monster trucks.

<li>Sunday = Sports. It's 
like the full moon or the 
changing of the tides.
Let it be.
<li>Shopping is not a 
sport, and no, we're never 
going to think of it that
way!
<li>When we have to go 
somewhere, absolutely 
anything you wear is fine.
Really!
<li>You have enough 
clothes.
<li>You have too many 
shoes.
<li>Crying is blackmail.
<li>Ask for what you 
want. Let's be clear on this 
one: Subtle hints don't
work. Strong hints don't 
work. Really obvious hints 
don't work. Just say  it!
<li>No, we don't know 
what day it is. We never will. 
Mark anniversaries on
the calendar.
<li>Peeing standing up is 
more difficult. We're bound 
to miss sometimes.
<li>Most guys own three 
pairs of shoes. What makes 
you think we'd be any
good at choosing which 
pair, out of thirty, would 
look good with your  dress?
<li>Yes and No are 
perfectly acceptable 
answers to almost every 
question.
<li>Come to us with a 
problem only if you want 
help solving it. That's  what
we do. Sympathy is what 
your girlfriends are for.
<li>A headache that lasts 
for 17 months is a problem. 
See a doctor.
<li>Foreign films are best 
left to foreigners. (Unless 
it's Bruce Lee or
some war flick where it 
doesn't really matter what 
the heck they're saying
anyway.)
<li>Check your oil. Please.
<li>It is neither in your 
best interest nor ours to 
take the quiz  together.
No, it doesn't matter 
which quiz.
<li>Anything we said 6 
months ago is inadmissible in 
an argument.
<li>All comments become 
null and void after 7 days.
<li>If something we said 
can be interpreted two 
ways, and one of the ways
makes you sad or angry, 
we meant the other one.
<li>Let us ogle. We're 
going to look anyway; it's 
genetic.
<li>You can either tell us 
to do something OR tell us 
how to do something
but not both.
<li>Whenever possible, 
please say whatever you 
have to say during
commercials.
<li>ALL men see in only 
16 colors. Peach is a fruit, 
not a color.
<li>If it itches, it will be 
scratched.
<li>If we ask what's 
wrong and you say 
"nothing," we will act like  
nothing's
wrong.

</OL>
<P>
Simple enough, right?
<P>
Thank You
