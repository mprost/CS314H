<PRE>A co-worker of mine recently sent this out over company mail about his
plight in holding onto Cokes kept in the company fridge...  

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Thursday, twelve Cokes to settle my cravin'
Had one for a snack, then t'were eleven.

Friday my Cokes did taste mighty fine.
Had two that day, and then there were nine.

Monday, my thirst to satiate,
but now were just seven, what should've been eight.

Tuesday, no Cokes did I take from my stash,
lunch was provided, IGS saved me some cash.

Wednesday, I drank one but what should I see?
What once was a twelve-pack, remained only three.

Sadly, I left those two cans all alone.
A few hours later and they too had flown.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
