A snippet spotted in Pilot Magazine and entered in Bike Magazine:

The article was entitled "In a hurry are we, sir?" ( British Police Wit).

Two members of the Lothian and Borders traffic police were out on the
Berwickshire moors with a radar gun recently, happily engaged in
apprehending speeding motorists, when their equipment suddenly
locked-up completely with an unexpected reading of well over 300 mph.
The mystery was explained seconds later as a low flying Harrier
hurtled over their heads.  The boys in blue, upset at the damage to
their radar gun, put in a complaint to the RAF, but were somewhat
chastened when the RAF pointed out that the damage might well have
been more severe. The Harrier's target-seeker had locked on to
the'enemy' radar and triggered an automatic retaliatory air-to-surface
missile attack. Luckily(?) the Harrier was operating unarmed.  *****

Gee Officer, sorry about your patrol car........

friend.
