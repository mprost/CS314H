<PRE>&gt;A large two engined train was crossing America. After they had gone some
&gt;distance one of the engines broke down. "No problem" the driver thought,
&gt;and carried on at half power. Farther on down the line, the other engine
&gt;broke down, and the train came to a standstill.
&gt;
&gt;The driver decided he should inform the passengers about why the train had
&gt;stopped, and made the following announcement:
&gt;
&gt;"Ladies and Gentlemen, I have some good news and some bad news. The bad
&gt;news is that both engines have failed, and we will be stuck here for some
&gt;time. The good news is that you decided to take the train and not fly."


It wouldn't have been bad if you HAD been in a plane,  Slightly the same thing
happened with my father and I.

We were flying from Philadelphia to San Francisco on one of those huge four
engined planes.  Shortly after take-off we felt a huge rumbling.  The crackle
of the intercom came on, and the pilot said:

"Attention passengers, engine number one is experiencing some problems, so we
will be shutting her down.  We apologize for the inconvenience, but the flight
will now be a five and a half hour trip, instead of the usual five hours."

There was a mild groan from the passengers, but it was interrupted by the same
rumbling.  

"Passengers, we again apologize, but enginge number two is now experiencing a
malfunction.  It too will have to be shut down.  The flight will now be a six
hour trip."

A louder groan, which was again disrupted by an even louder rumbling.

"Again, we apologize, engine three has burned out.  We will arrive in San
Fransisco eight hours from the take-off time."

Understandably, the people in the plane got fidgety, and my father said, "I
sure hope engine number four doesn't go down."

"Yeah," I said, "then we'll be up here forever."
