I submit the following. For all I know, it may have originated in 
rec.humor.funny, but I don't know. This was sent to me by a friend. 
Apparently it has an unknown author. 
<P>
[Note - Michael subsequently reported that the author is Terry Bisson, it 
originally appeared in OMNI Magazine, it was nominated for a Nebula, 
and it is reprinted here by permission of Mr. Bisson.  My thanks 
to Michael and Terry - ed.]

Imagine if you will... the leader of the fifth invader force speaking to 
the commander in chief... 
<P>
"They're made out of meat." 
<P>
"Meat?" 
<P>
"Meat. They're made out of meat." 
<P>
"Meat?" 
<P>
"There's no doubt about it. We picked several from different parts of 
the planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, probed them all the way 
through. They're completely meat." 
<P>
"That's impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages to the 
stars." 
<P>
"They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals don't come from them. 
The signals come from machines." 
<P>
"So who made the machines? That's who we want to contact." 
<P>
"They made the machines. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Meat made 
the machines." 
<P>
"That's ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You're asking me to 
believe in sentient meat." 
<P>
"I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. These creatures are the only 
sentient race in the sector and they're made out of meat." 
<P>
"Maybe they're like the Orfolei. You know, a carbon-based intelligence 
that goes through a meat stage." 
<P>
"Nope. They're born meat and they die meat. We studied them for several 
of their life spans, which didn't take too long. Do you have any idea 
the life span of meat?" 
<P>
"Spare me. Okay, maybe they're only part meat. You know, like the 
Weddilei.  A meat head with an electron plasma brain inside." 
<P>
"Nope. We thought of that, since they do have meat heads like the 
Weddilei.  But I told you, we probed them. They're meat all the way 
through." 
<P>
"No brain?" 
<P>
"Oh, there is a brain all right. It's just that the brain is made out of 
meat!" 
<P>
"So... what does the thinking?" 
<P>
"You're not understanding, are you? The brain does the thinking. The 
meat." 
<P>
"Thinking meat! You're asking me to believe in thinking meat!" 
<P>
"Yes, thinking meat! Conscious meat! Loving meat. Dreaming meat. The 
meat is the whole deal! Are you getting the picture?" 
<P>
"Omigod. You're serious then. They're made out of meat." 
<P>
"Finally, Yes. They are indeed made out meat. And they've been trying to 
get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years." 
<P>
"So what does the meat have in mind?" 
<P>
"First it wants to talk to us. Then I imagine it wants to explore the 
universe, contact other sentients, swap ideas and information. The 
usual." 
<P>
"We're supposed to talk to meat?" 
<P>
"That's the idea. That's the message they're sending out by radio. 
'Hello. Anyone out there? Anyone home?' That sort of thing." 
<P>
"They actually do talk, then. They use words, ideas, concepts?" 
<P>
"Oh, yes. Except they do it with meat." 
<P>
"I thought you just told me they used radio." 
<P>
"They do, but what do you think is on the radio? Meat sounds. You know 
how  when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise? They talk by flapping 
their meat at each other. They can even sing by squirting air through 
their meat." 
<P>
"Omigod. Singing meat. This is altogether too much. So what do you 
advise?" 
<P>
"Officially or unofficially?" 
<P>
"Both." 
<P>
"Officially, we are required to contact, welcome, and log in any and all 
sentient races or multibeings in the quadrant, without prejudice, fear, 
or favor. Unofficially, I advise that we erase the records and forget 
the whole thing." 
<P>
"I was hoping you would say that." 
<P>
"It seems harsh, but there is a limit. Do we really want to make contact 
with meat?" 
<P>
"I agree one hundred percent. What's there to say?" `Hello, meat. How's 
it going?' But will this work? How many planets are we dealing with 
here?" 
<P>
"Just one. They can travel to other planets in special meat containers, 
but they can't live on them. And being meat, they only travel through C 
space. Which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility 
of their ever making contact pretty slim. Infinitesimal, in fact." 
<P>
"So we just pretend there's no one home in the universe." 
<P>
"That's it." 
<P>
"Cruel. But you said it yourself, who wants to meet meat? And the ones 
who have been aboard our vessels, the ones you have probed? You're sure 
they won't remember?" 
<P>
"They'll be considered crackpots if they do. We went into their heads 
and smoothed out their meat so that we're just a dream to them." 
<P>
"A dream to meat! How strangely appropriate, that we should be meat's 
dream." 
<P>
"And we can mark this sector unoccupied." 
<P>
"Good. Agreed, officially and unofficially. Case closed. Any others? 
Anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy?" 
<P>
"Yes, a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a 
class nine star in G445 zone. Was in contact two galactic rotations ago, 
wants to be friendly again." 
<P>
"They always come around." 
<P>
"And why not? Imagine how unbearably, how unutterably cold the universe 
would be if one were all alone." 
<P>
