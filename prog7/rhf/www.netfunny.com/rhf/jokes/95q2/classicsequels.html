Lesser Known Sequels of the Classics<BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
</center>
<P>
<H4>Metamorphosis II</H4>
<P>
Gregor Samsa goes through another mystical transformation, 
this time from a giant cockroach into a lounge singer.  The 
few people who still felt any compassion for him are now 
totally repulsed, and he moves away to Vegas. 
<P>
<H4>Taming of the Shrew II: Who's the Shrew?</H4>
<P>
The antics begin when Petruchio and Katherine's daughter 
Bianca (named after her aunt) comes of age and turns out to 
be quite a shrew herself.  Katherine at first tries to convince 
her daughter that good manners are the right way, then turns 
back to shrewishness herself to show her daughter how 
unattractive it can be.  This all builds to the hilarious 
climactic scene, where Petruchio beats them both into 
submission with an ax handle. 
<P>
<H4>Huck Finn II</H4>
<P>
Huck has grown up and propspered as a certified public 
accountant.  He decides he likes civilzation after all, though 
he never does take to wearing shoes, thus his nickname, the 
"barefoot bookkeeper."  Jim leaves the Indians and gets his 
law degree, and eventually defends the King and Duke who are 
up on a racketeering charge. 
<P>
<H4>Lysistrata II</H4>
<P>
Once again, Lysistrata convinces the women of Athens to 
boycott sex, this time to convince the men not to lay around 
and watch wrestling on Sundays.  Cinesias tries to convince 
Myrrhine to lie with him while watching wrestling, but she 
teases him and then refuses.  Some of the men try goats, but 
decide they don't like them.  Eventually the men give in. 
<P>
<H4>The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe</H4>
<P>
Robinson Crusoe uses the money he inherited from the 
Brazilian plantation to start up a small cruise company. One 
day while taking out five passengers on a three hour tour to 
the Isle of Wight, a storm breaks out.  He and his first mate 
Friday (a mighty sailing man) do their best, but lose control 
of the boat.  Eventually, it crashes on a deserted island. 
The rest of the book describes the antics that occur when 
they almost get rescued several times, but Friday screws it 
up each time. 
<P>
<H4>Undeath of a Salesman</H4>
<P>
Willy Loman comes back from the dead as a vampire.  His 
hypnotic control over his customers reestablishes his life 
as a salesman.  He convinces Biff (no relation to B1FF) to 
go into professional football, where he becomes a big star 
but loses respect for his father when he does an advertizement 
for nylons. 
<P>
<H4>The Divine Tragedy</H4>
<P>
In this controversial sequel, Dante travels through New 
York City, Billings (Montana), and Salt Lake City.  The 
controversy is over the origin.  Joseph Smith claimed that 
Dante dictated this book to him in dreams, which literary 
critics have shown a lot of skepticism about. 
<P>
<H4>The Bible II</H4>
<P>
Of the Dead Sea Scrolls, these were the only ones that 
were deliberately lost.  They recount the tale of how Jesus 
descended back out of Heaven and became a lounge singer. 
Even his staunchest followers deserted him for this, and 
when Peter finally left he moved to Vegas and got a regular 
gig at the Tropicana changing water into wine.
