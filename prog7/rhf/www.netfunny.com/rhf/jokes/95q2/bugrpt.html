Thanks to Rick Wessman.... 
<P>
an actual bug report 
<P>
[ This is from a friend at Microsoft ] 
<P>
<BR>Bug #   Status          Title<BR>
5143    ACTIVE          "Build done" signal makes no sound<BR>
---------- ACTIVE - 01/30/95 - MIKEBLAS --------------------<BR>
<P>
Visual C++ makes an audible signal when a build completes. When no developer<BR>
is in the room, this signal doesn't make a sound. To reproduce:<BR>
<P>
<!--  list-->
<OL><LI>Start a build.<BR>
<LI>Leave the room.<BR>
<LI>Note that the chime does not make a sound.<BR>
</OL>
<P>
We should find a way to make the build bell make a sound even if nobody is<BR>
there to hear it.<BR>
<P>
This philosophical issue may need program management's attention before being<BR>
resolved.<BR>
<P>
---------- ASSIGNED to MATTHEWT - 01/30/95 - SCOTF ---------<BR>
<P>
Can we use the telepathy support in Win95 to contact whomever is logged into<BR>
the machine doing the build? Maybe we should just detect when the developer is<BR>
leaving the room and prompt for a phone number where s/he can be reached.<BR>
<P>
How about disabling leaving the room during a build?<BR>
<P>
---------- RESOLVED - BY DESIGN - 01/31/95 - MATTHEWT ------<BR>
---------- ACTIVE - 02/01/95 - MARKLAM ---------------------<BR>
<P>
Actually, we can't do this either. The problem is that while you're out of the<BR>
room your build is neither finished nor unfinished. It stays in a state of<BR>
flux until you return and collapse the quantum uncertainty by observing it.<BR>
<P>
Perhaps we could link the build finished event to a cat in a box?<BR>
<P>
---------- ASSIGNED to HEISENBERG - 02/01/95 - MARKLAM -----<BR>
---------- RESOLVED - NOT REPRO - 02/03/95 - HEISENBERG ----<BR>
<P>
I cannot repro this. I tried standing just outside my door and it made the<BR>
beep. Do I have to go further from my office? Would the mailroom do?<BR>
<P>
---------- ACTIVE - 02/03/95 - MIKEBLAS --------------------<BR>
<P>
The relative position of the mailroom and your office are relatively uncertain<BR>
to me, Doctor.<BR>
<P>
Please try again:<BR>
<P>
<!--  list-->
<OL><LI>start a build<BR>
<LI>leave your office<BR>
<LI>go down the hall<BR>
<LI>wait until you don't hear the beep<BR>
<LI>return to note that the build is done<BR>
</OL>
<P>
I think this is how I first repro'ed the problem, but I can't remember what I<BR>
was doing to make it happen.<BR>
<P>
The idea of disabling leaving the room might be the best possible solution, I<BR>
think. When a build starts, the IDE should pop up a message that says, "There<BR>
are no more Fritos" or "The kitchen has closed early" or "The bathroom is<BR>
being cleaned" so the developer will not be tempted to get up and wander<BR>
around.<BR>
<P>
With minimal rebuild in place, we should consider diversions that won't take<BR>
as long to remedy: "You're expecting a phone call" or "Someone will stop by to<BR>
see you soon."<BR>
<P>
We need to think of messages that are easy to localize for VC++3.0J.<BR>
<P>
---------- ASSIGNED to MIKEBLAS - 02/13/95 - MARKLAM -------<BR>
<P>
To do this we'll need to avoid messages about the bathrooms and vending<BR>
machines for external releases. Perhaps some customer research is needed to<BR>
find out exactly <B>why</B> Visual C++ users leave their keyboards.<BR>
<P>
Some suggestions (including MB_ types)<BR>
Get a drink :<BR>
(i) You're out of coffee<BR>
(i) You're out of tea<BR>
(i)(i) YYoouuvv''ee hhaadd eennoouugghh<BR>
<P>
Get something to eat :<BR>
(?) You have no food, remember<BR>
/!\ You need to lose weight, fatso. Sit your ass down<BR>
<P>
Exercise etc :<BR>
(?) Did You Know - sunlight causes skin cancer<BR>
(i) With a Nordik Trak you can get a workout in front of your monitor.<BR>
Call for home delivery<BR>
/!\ I didn't mean that about your weight<BR>
<P>
See family :<BR>
(i) They already know you love them<BR>
/!\ They'll only want money for something<BR>
/!\ Your in-laws have arrived<BR>
<P>
Call of nature :<BR>
<P>
This could be difficult. Consider supplying bed-pan or similar.<BR>
<P>

<P>
I attempted to repro this once more:<BR>
<P>
I placed my machine in the forest at the edge of the campus. I started a<BR>
'rebuild all' and ran out of the forest towards my mailroom. My build normally<BR>
takes 3 minutes. After 5 minutes I had not heard anything, so I returned to my<BR>
machine. Unfortunately a tree had fallen on it. I had not heard that, either.<BR>
