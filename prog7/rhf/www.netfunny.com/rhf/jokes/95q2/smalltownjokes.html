  Translated, re-edited, puritanically censored where deemed reasonable 
  by A.R. Pruss (pruss@math.ubc.ca).  Original Polish text from
  andy@mimuw.edu.pl.

  Obviously some of humour the original has to have been lost, except in
  one case where we actually gained a good pun for free in literal 
  translation :-)  (Will you spot it?)

  The original jokes were set in Wachock, Poland;  the place names were 
  changed to make the jokes more euphoneous for the English reader.
