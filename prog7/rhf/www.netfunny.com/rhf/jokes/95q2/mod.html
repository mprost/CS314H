<PRE>I know that submitting this specifically violates one of the published
guidelines for rhf submissions, but what the heck.  I think the new
moderator may be willing to overlook it this one time...  ;-)

Those rhf readers who don't also read rec.arts.startrek.info may not
know that the new rhf moderator has moderated rasi for a long time.
But worse than that, they missed this little gem embedded in Jim
Griffith's announcement to rasi readers of his new position as rhf 
moderator:

   As an aside, I next plan to gun for both news.announce.newgroups
   and comp.risks.  I figure that along with the mysterious but timely
   disappearance of alt.conspiracy and talk.politics.guns, once I've 
   gotten them, I'll have accomplished my goal of imposing my will
   upon all of USENET's readership.  I'll control Star Trek, I'll
   control humor, I'll control which newsgroups exist, and I'll
   ensure that no one can be warned about the threat I pose.  So 
   Mr. Neumann and Mr. Lawrence, you've been warned.  And once the
   Internet is present in every household in the world, I'll have
   fulfilled my dream to become the absolute ruler of the hearts and
   minds of every sentient being on the planet.  But I digress.
