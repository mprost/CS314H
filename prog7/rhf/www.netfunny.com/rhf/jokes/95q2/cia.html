Three guys are applying for job with the CIA.  They got all the 
way to the final test. 
<P>
So the first guy walks into the directors office and sits down. 
The director reaches in his desk and pulls out a pistol.  Lays it 
on his desk in front of the guy.  Tells him, "This test is to 
test your loyalty.  Take this gun and go up the stairs and go 
into the first room on your right.  Your wife will be in there. 
Put a bullet in her head."  The guy looks at him and says,"no 
way."  So the director says, "You fail." 
<P>
The next guy comes in.  The diresctor tells him the same thing. 
Guy picks up the gun and head for the room.  Comes back about 15 
minutes later.  Tells the director that he just couldn't go 
through with it.  The director says, "you fail." 
<P>
So now the third guy comes in, same scene.  Guy heads up to the 
room. The director hears 3 shots, followed by a whole lot of 
ruckus(glass breaking, funiture getting smashed).  Guy comes back 
in all beat up and his clothes tore up.  The director goes, "What 
happened to you?"  Guy replies, "After three shots I realized 
that there were blanks in the gun so I had to choke her to 
death." 
<P>
