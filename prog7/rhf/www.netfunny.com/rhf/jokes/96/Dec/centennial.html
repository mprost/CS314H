<PRE>&gt;I was watching the news this weekend and they reported that a freight ship
&gt;collided with a shopping mall and hotel in New Orleans.

&gt;I turned to my wife and said, "It's good to hear that Captain Hazelwood is
&gt;working again."

Actually, it wasn't Hazelwood.

Reports are that the captain of the stricken boat did an outstanding job of
handling the unexpected power outage that caused the lack of control and
collision.

He not only dropped the anchor and took other measures to avoid what would
likely have been a deadly collision with another boat loaded with people,
but also warned people on shore ahead of time, which probably avoided several
fatalities as well.

So, the US media is hailing him as a hero.

As a result, unnamed FBI sources identify him as the new "prime suspect" in
last summer's Centennial Park bombing in Atlanta.
