<PRE>
	This year I bought several new strings of Christmas lights, the
fancy kind that flash multiple different light patterns.  Several days
after putting them up on the Christmas Tree, I noticed that one string was
"stuck"; the lights did not flash.  I thought it was somewhat strange
that the lights would be "stuck", as I knew that the light controller
was electronic, with no mechanical parts to get "stuck".

	I unplugged and plugged in the lights, and pressed the button on
the light controller box until the lights started working again.

	I had walked a few steps away when it struck me what had just
happened:

	The light string was controlled by state-machine firmware.
In other words, it was run by computer software.

	I had just experienced a Christmas light firmware crash.

	I had just rebooted my Christmas lights.
