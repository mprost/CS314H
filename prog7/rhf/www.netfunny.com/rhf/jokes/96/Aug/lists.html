<PRE>
A group of staff recently bought their own filter machines and formed   
their own "coffee club".  Lists started appearing on the walls of the   
coffee corner - lists of club members, lists of coffee making   
instructions, lists of coffee minders, lists of club rules, etc.   
Yesterday a new list appeared, created by a staff member (David White,   
who prefers to remain anonymous):

LIST MAKERS CLUB

1.  A new list should be typed and attached to this cupboard at least   
once a week and preferably more frequently.

2.  The list of people responsible for making lists will be maintained by   
and posted here regularly.

3.  Any list should be outlined in coloured marker and have many key   
words similarly outlined.

4.  Any one failing to maintain their list will be put on the black list.

5.  A list of people on the black list will be posted unless those people   
are already on a list (such as the coffee list - also known as the brown   
list) in which case they will be removed from that list and their names   
entered on the list of people with no lists.

6.  Before anyone can remove their name from a list, their name should   
first be put onto the list of people who do not want to be on lists.

7.  Anyone who is listless should be entered on the list of listless   
people. This list of listless people should be maintained separately from   
the list of people who are not on a list.

8.  If any of these instructions are not clear then please enter your   
name on the list, listing clearly your problems with the list.

9.  Anyone in this room wishing to drink anything whilst reading the   
lists will find two pots of coffee standing under the lists.
