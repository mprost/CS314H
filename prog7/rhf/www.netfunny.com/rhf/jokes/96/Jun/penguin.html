<PRE>The Linux community have been trying to get the 'perfect' penguin logo
for a week or so now. Various things have been battered around and Linus
finally came up with this spec for the penguin he wanted:

&gt; Now, when you think about penguins, first take a deep calming breath, and
&gt; then think "cuddly". Take another breath, and think "cute". Go back to
&gt; "cuddly" for a while (and go on breathing), then think "contented".
&gt;
&gt; With me so far? Good..
&gt;
&gt; Now, with penguins, (cuddly such), "contented" means it has either just
&gt; gotten laid, or it's stuffed on herring. Take it from me, I'm an expert on
&gt; penguins, those are really the only two options.
&gt;
&gt; Now, working on that angle, we don't really want to be associated with a
&gt; randy penguin (well, we do, but it's not politic, so we won't), so we
&gt; should be looking at the "stuffed to its brim with herring" angle here.
&gt;
&gt; So when you think "penguin", you should be imagining a slighly overweight
&gt; penguin (*), sitting down after having gorged itself, and having just burped.
&gt; It's sitting there with a beatific smile - the world is a good place to be
&gt; when you have just eaten a few gallons of raw fish and you can feel another
&gt; "burp" coming.
&gt;
&gt; (*) Not FAT, but you should be able to see that it's sitting down because
&gt; it's really too stuffed to stand up. Think "bean bag" here.
&gt;
&gt; Now, if you have problems associating yourself with something that gets
&gt; off by eating raw fish, think "chocolate" or something, but you get the
&gt; idea.
&gt;
&gt; Ok, so we should be thinking of a lovable, cuddly, stuffed penguin
&gt; sitting down after having gorged itself on herring. Still with me?
&gt;
&gt; NOW comes the hard part. With this image firmly etched on your eyeballs, you
&gt; then scetch a stylizied version of it. Not a lot of detail - just a black
&gt; brush-type outline (you know the effect you get with a brush where the
&gt; thickness of the line varies). THAT requires talent.  Give people the
&gt; outline, and they should say [ sickly sweet voice, babytalk almost ]"Ooh,
&gt; what a cuddly penguin, I bet he is just <i>stuffed</i> with herring", and small
&gt; children will jump up and down and scream "mommy mommy, can I have one too?".
&gt;                                                                               

(of course I'm not sure why small children want herring)
