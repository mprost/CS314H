&gt; 
&gt; The Shotgun Constitution
&gt;  -by Brian Gerk
&gt; 
&gt; Terminology:
&gt; Shotgun -The rightmost front passenger seat in a vehicle, a prime
&gt; choice for any passenger, since it is the most comfortable seat, and also
&gt; because of the psychological advantage of not being forced to
&gt; subserviently look at the back of another person's head during a trip.
&gt; Enthronement-The physical presence of a person in the Shotgun
&gt; position.
&gt; 
&gt; By Laws:
&gt; Vehicle Ownership
&gt; The owner of a vehicle, if he/she isn?t driving, always gets Shotgun in
&gt; that vehicle. It is their car, it is their seat and they get it. This is a
&gt; real
&gt; bonus for an owner who is falling down drunk. They can rest assured
&gt; Shotgun is rightfully theirs. They won?t have to worry about
&gt; concentrating through an alcohol-induced haze simply to remember to
&gt; call Shotgun in their own hard-earned car. Once proper Shotgun
&gt; ?enthronement? rights have been established, they may also be
&gt; surrendered. If the owner of the vehicle is eligible for Shotgun, but
&gt; wants to sleep it off in the back seat, then they may give up Shotgun to a
&gt; person of their choice. The vehicle owner is also the ultimate judge in
&gt; any Shotgun disputes. Their word is law, and all passengers must defer
&gt; to the owner?s interpretation of Shotgun law. Arbitration should be swift
&gt; and final, so that everyone can be on their way. If the owner is going to
&gt; stray from the Shotgun Constitution, they must have a good reason for
&gt; doing so. If the owner is not eligible for Shotgun, any passenger can call
&gt; Shotgun, but only under the proper conditions
&gt; 
&gt; Legal Conditions for Calling Shotgun
&gt; Shotgun can only be called when the driver is enroute to the vehicle for
&gt; the purpose of driving immediately, and the Shotgun position is vacant.
&gt; Shotgun cannot be called upon arrival, only upon departure. For example,
&gt; a group of travelers may arrive at a restaurant and get out of the car for
&gt; a meal. Some bone-head might try calling Shotgun immediately for the
&gt; subsequent ride home, but that is not appropriate. If this kind of
&gt; precedent were allowed, it would let anyone call Shotgun ?futures? for
&gt; potential rides into eternity. Only after finishing the meal, when the
&gt; driver
&gt; picks up the car keys, is a Shotgun call allowed. Jingling keys is a very
&gt; strong sign of an Enroute condition. If the driver says ?lets go? that also
&gt; can be reasonably construed as Enroute. Most Enroute conditions mean
&gt; that driving will take place within a few minutes, but not always. If the
&gt; driver of a car turns around on a three hour trail ride, and says ?lets go
&gt; home,? then an enroute condition exists and Shotgun may be called
&gt; immediately.
&gt; 
&gt; Forcible Dethronement (a.k.a. Physical Challenge)
&gt; There are some people in this world that always remember to call
&gt; Shotgun. Although this is an admirable trait at first, it quickly grows old.
&gt; These people tend to be real weenies, and if they knew better, would
&gt; sometimes let someone else call shotgun just to be a little more
&gt; diplomatic.The purpose of the Shotgun Constitution is to provide for a
&gt; peaceful, fair method of getting to ride Shotgun. Unfortunately, if an
&gt; introverted nerd consistently calls Shotgun ad nauseum, there must be
&gt; accommodations for that person to be forcibly removed from the seat.
&gt; Thus the Forcible Dethronement policy. This allows one other passenger
&gt; (usually larger in stature) to declare ?Physical Challenge!? and pull, push
&gt; or otherwise eject the previous Shotgun participant from the seat.
&gt; Although frowned upon if used regularly, this physical challenge is a
&gt; legitimate means of wresting Shotgun control away from the legal party.
&gt; Any physical tactics short of grievous bodily injury are employable.
&gt; 
&gt; The Dick Clause
&gt; Though not a formal by-law of the Constitution, the Dick Clause is a
&gt; necessary refinement in semantics.Just because the driver?s girlfriend,
&gt; boyfriend, wife, whoever happens to be in the car, that Significant Other
&gt; does not get Shotgun by default. Anyone else can legally call Shotgun
&gt; and force the Significant Other to ride in the back.But then of course that
&gt; would mean that person is a Dick.
&gt; 
&gt; Post-amble
&gt; I first drafted the Shotgun Constitution in 1990 while attending
&gt; Embry-Riddle University in Florida. The Constitution was widely
&gt; distributed via fax, and steered many young passengers towards a more
&gt; democratic form of ridership. It is time to resurrect this living document,
&gt; and to let a new generation of passengers rightfully call SHOTGUN.
&gt; 
&gt; If there is any new case law I should be aware of for the Shotgun
&gt; Constitution, please e-mail me at: gerkie@aol.com. I will conduct a judicial
&gt; review of your case and see whether it merits an amendment to the
&gt; Constitution.
