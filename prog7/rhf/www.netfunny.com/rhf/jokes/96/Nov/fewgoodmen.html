<PRE>Here's a joke that I got from a friend...

(fade in to a stately looking lecture hall, rain is pounding
the windows and thunder crashes sporadically)

professor:  ...you, Mr....um...Smyth?  Can you tell me what
Rousseau was getting at in the readings?

student:  Well sir, I didn't get quite that far in the--

prof:  Dammit! I'm tired of your excuses.  Everyday you walk
into this classroom sleepy-eyed and unprepared.  Not once have
you come up anything that even remotely resembled an answer.

stu:  You want answers?

prof:  I think I'm entitled to one.

stu:  You want answers?!

prof: I want the truth!

stu:  You can't handle the truth!! (dramatic pause)  Sir, we live in
a world that has parties, and these parties have to be attended
by men with cups.  Who's gonna do it?  You?  You Mr. Teaching
Assistant?  I have a greater responsibility than you can
possibly fathom.  You read your little textbooks and you curse
the fraternities.  You have that luxury; you have the luxury of
not knowing what i know:  that my partying, while grotesque and
incomprehensible to you, saves lives.  We use words like
"keg-stand"," beer-bong", "shotgun."  We use these words as the
backbone of a life spent drinking something.  You use them as a
punchline.  I have neither the time, nor the inclination to
explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps underneath the
blanket of the very inebriation that I provide.  I'd rather you
said thank you and went on your way.  Otherwise, I suggest you
pick up a mug, and start to chug.  Either way, I don't give a
damn what you think you're entitled to!

prof:  Did you fail to do the work?

stu:  I did my job, I'd do it--

prof:  DID YOU FAIL TO DO THE WORK?

stu:  YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I DID!
