<PRE>I found this on the fax machine at our church, I don't know who
originally wrote it. Sorry if it offends anybody.

Dear Friend,

I have the distinguished honor of being on the committee for raising five
million dollars to place a statue of Bill Clinton in the Hall of Fame in
Washington, D.C.

This committee was in quandary as to where to place the statue. It was no
wise to place it beside the statue of George Washington, who never told a
lie, nor Jesse Jackson, who never told the truth, since Bill Clinton could
never tell the difference.

We finally decided to place it beside Christopher Columbus, the greatest
Democrat of all. He left, not knowing where he was going, and upon
arriving, did not know where he has. He returned not knowing where he had
been, and did it all on borrowed money.

Over 5,000 years ago, Moses said to the Children of Israel; "Pick up you
shovels, mount your assess and camels, and I will lead you to the Promised
Land." Nearly 5,000 years later, Roosevelt said; 'Lay down your shovels,
sit on your assess, and light up a camel. This is the Promised Land."

Now, Bill Clinton is going to steal your shovels, kick you assess, raise
the price of camels, and mortgage the Promised Land. It you are one of the
fortunate people who has any money left, after paying taxes, we will
expect a generous donation, as a contribution to this worthwhile project.

Sincerely,

BILL CLINTON STATUE COMMITTEE
