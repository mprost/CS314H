<PRE>My brother-in-law told me this one on Sunday morning:


A guy walks into a bar with a dachsund under his arm. The dog is wearing a
NY Jets jersey, helmet, and is festooned with Jets pom poms.

The bartender says, "Hey! No pets are allowed in here! You'll have to leave!"

The guy begs him: "Look, I'm desparate. We're both big fans, the TV is
broken, and this is the only place around where we can see the game!"

After securing a promise that the dog will behave, and warning him that he
and the dog will be thrown out if there's any trouble, the bartender
relents and allows them to stay in the bar and watch the game.

The game begins with the Jets receiving the kickoff. They march downfield,
get stopped at about the 30, and kick a field goal.

With that the dog jumps up on the bar, and begins walking up and down the
bar giving a high-five to everyone.

The bartender says, "Wow, that is the most amazing thing I've ever seen!
What does the dog do if they score a touchdown?"

The owner replies, "I don't know, I've only had him for 4 years."
