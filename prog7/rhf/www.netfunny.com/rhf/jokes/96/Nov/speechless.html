&gt;From:  K. Eng[SMTP:kleng@u.washington.edu]
&gt;Subject:        Sometimes guys just have nothing to say...

   King Arthur was preparing to go out on an expedition and would be
away from Camelot for an indefinite period of time.

    King Arthur was worried about leaving Queen Guinevere alone with
all  those horny knights of the Round Table.  So he went to Merlin for
some advice.  After explaining his predicament to Merlin, the wizard
looked  thoughtful, and said that he'd see if he could come up with
something, and asked him to come back in a week.

     A week later King Arthur was back in Merlin's laboratory where the
good wizard was showing him his latest invention.  It was a  chastity
belt... except that it had a rather large hole in the most obvious
place.  "This is no good, Merlin!" the  king exclaimed, "Look at
this opening.  How is this supposed to protect m'lady, the Queen?"

     "Ah, sire, just observe."  said Merlin as he searched his cluttered
work bench until he found what he was looking for.  He then  selected
his most worn-out wand, one that he was going to discard anyway.   He
 then inserted it in the gaping aperture of the chastity belt whereupon a
small guillotine blade came down and cut it neatly in two.

    "Merlin, you are a genius!" said the greatful monarch, "Now I can
leave, knowing that my Queen is fully protected."

    After putting Guinevere in the device, King Arthur then set out  upon
his Quest.  Several years passed until he returned to Camelot.

    Immediately he assembled all his knights in the courtyard and had them
drop their trousers for an informal 'short arm' inspection.  Sure
enough!  Each and every one of them was either amputated or damaged
in some way.  All of them except Sir Galahad.

   "Sir Galahad", exclaimed King Arthur, "The one and only true  knight!
Only you among all the nobles have been true to me.  What is it in
my power to grant you?  Name it and it is yours!"

    But Sir Galahad was speechless.
