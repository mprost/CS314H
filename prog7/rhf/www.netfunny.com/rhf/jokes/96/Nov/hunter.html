<PRE>Heard between periods of a Ft. Wayne Komets hockey game.

	A hunter was in a tree with his muzzle loader when he sees a bear
coming down the path.  He takes careful aim and fires.  The smoke clears
and he peers down at the path.  No bear!  The hunter feels a tap on his
shoulder, looks behind him and sees the bear.  "Were you trying to kill
me?" the bear growls.  "No, no, of course not."  "I don't believe you"
responded the bear.  Without another word, the bear throws the hunter
over the branch and proceeds to screw the hell out of him.
	The next day the hunter brought his AR-15.  He climbed up the same tree
and waited.  Sure enough, here came the bear.  The hunter lets fly with
a dozen rounds.  The smokes clears; no bear!  TAP, TAP.  The hunter
slowly looked around at the bear.  "Just target shooting, I suppose"
says the bear.  "Uh, well" the hunter mumbled.  Without waiting for
another word, the bear throws the hunter over a tree limb and proceeds
to screw him again.
	The next day the hunter borrows a BAR from a friend.  He climbs into
the tree and waits.  The bear arrives and the hunter empties the clip. 
Smoke clears; no bear.  Tap, tap.  The hunter looks around again.  The
bear says, "You really aren't here for the hunting, are you?"
