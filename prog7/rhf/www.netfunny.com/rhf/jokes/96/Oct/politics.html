Below find several recent jokes about American politics.  These are jokes
which are funny, but which didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post
such a digest whenever I have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly
selective readers will probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to
killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in the title - ed.

Subject: Politics on the bus

I overheard the following on the bus today:

Passenger: Why is there all this traffic?

Driver: The president is coming to town today.

Passenger: I'd much rather have Perot visit.

Driver: Yeah, there'd be a lot less traffic.

Subject: vice-presidential debate

Heard this from a local dj on a radio station in Sacramento (paraphrased):

After watching the vice-presidential debate last night, Bill Clinton 
proclaimed it a victory for the democratic party, stating that it went "as 
smoothly as a silk blouse sliding off the back of a young campaign worker."

Subject: I'll be home for Christmas...

Heard on the Ronn Owens radio show here in S.F...

Who do you think will be home for Christmas first?  The troops in Bosnia,
or Susan McDougal?

Subject: Green Thumb

&gt;From a Reuter's News article:  
"Republicans called on the Democrats to return $425,000 in contributions from 
an Indonesian couple, Arief and Soraya Wiriadinata, with ties to Indonesia's 
Lippo Group conglomerate, as well as $140,000 raised at a Buddhist temple in 
California. Arief Wiriadinata worked as a landscaper in Virginia."

Anybody know how I can get myself enrolled in one o' them Virginian Landscaping 
schools?
