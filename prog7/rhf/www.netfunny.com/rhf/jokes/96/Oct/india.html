[Got this idea from someone long time back. I cant
remember the guy's name. Most of it is original. 
Some of it is from what other Indians have told me they
would like to say.]

 Being from India, I get a lot of questions about
my country. Sometimes the questions do become rather
exasperating.

Q&gt; Say, do you guys have electricity in India ?

A: Ofcourse. We generate electricity by making an elephant
run around a field by setting fire to its tail.


Q&gt; Do you have cars in India ?

A: No. We only use cows and elephants.


Q&gt; Do you have enough food in your country ?

A: No. But when we get hungry, we eat the cows and the elephants.


Q&gt; With so many religions, how do you stay united ?

A: A common hatred of stupid Americans.


Q&gt; I hear that you actually have snake charmers with poisonous
snakes roaming the cities.

A: Oh yes, I was a snake charmer once. Infact, I have one  up my
pants right now.

Q&gt;  Do people have enough clothes to wear ?

A: Sure. Everybody wears exclusive Calvin Klein underwear, Its keeps
us cool.

Q&gt; Do you actually burn widows right after her husband's death?

A: Yup. We burn them whenever we want.

Q&gt; Can women vote in India ?

A: No. We just burn them.

Q&gt;  Do you have enough fuel in India?

A: I just told you about the women, didnt I ?!!

Q&gt; I hear you get great hash in India.

A: Yup. Directly from the CIA.


Q&gt; Do you have "arranged" marriages in India ?

A: Ofcourse. We do like to organize things, you know...

Q&gt; Do you speak Hindu ?

A: Yes. I also speak Christianity, Islam and Buddhism.

Q&gt; Are you a Hindi ?

A: Oh yes, I am also English, French and Spanish.

Q&gt; Where is India ?

A: Follow I5. You'll get there eventually.
