Here are some of the better mad cow jokes which have been submitted lately.

There's a variant of BSE that's been found in kosher cattle.  It's called
"I-had-expected-better-from-you cow disease."

Subject: Mad cow disease


(By Angus Hamilton quoted in LA Times)

Feminists are protesting the designation, "mad cow disease," arguing that 
if a cow becomes mad it is because of something the bull said or did.

Subject: Mad Cow Disease solved!

Here's a better one! (from Barry James in the International Herald Tribune)

The Cambodia Daily newspaper suggested that all 12 million mad British cows
should be shipped to Cambodia and allowed to roam free.  This would solve
both country's problems: Cambodia has about 11 million unexploded mad land
mines.  The plan is "simple, practical, and will make mincemeat of the
problem overnight".

Rumor has it that Joe Cocker's next album is going to be called
"Mad Cows and Englishmen"

 (I hope you've all been following the latest European agricultural problems.)
   
    
So there were these two cows, chatting over the fence between their fields.
The first cow said, "I tell you, this mad-cow-disease is really pretty
scary.  They say it is spreading fast; I heard it hit some cows down on
the Johnson Farm."
     
The other cow replies, "Hell, I ain't worried, it don't affect us ducks."
      
[Note - this joke recycled because of its timeliness, because so many other
	people have submitted it recently, and because I like it so much - ed.]
