<P>
I got this message detailing a first day of class experience from a 
friend of a friend.  His name is Kevin Stone, and he goes to Clemson 
University. 
<P>
Just a friendly reminder--look for door numbers.... 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
So I'm looking for a class in Newman Hall--- actually, I was looking 
for Newman Hall-- and, I thought i'd found it.  no sign-- no main 
entrance. 
<P>
So I walk around the building and find what I perceive to be an acutal 
door with and actual doorknob.  So I opened it. 
<P>
Inside was a room at least 150x50-- maybe half a football field- maybe 
more- black concrete- 20ft ceiling. 
<P>
Two guys in white overcoats. 
A cow.  Upside-down with hooves pointing into the air. 
On some type of cart. 
<P>
A chainsaw. 
<P>
They were as embarrased to see me as I was to see them. 
<P>
Everybody stared at everybody else for about 6 sec. (except the cow, 
who was not facing me.)  And I shut the door. 
<P>
"Not econ." 
<P>
I wasn't more than 10ft away from the door when I heard it lock. 
<P>
I don't know what the hell they were doing, but they seemed to need 
privacy. 
<P>
