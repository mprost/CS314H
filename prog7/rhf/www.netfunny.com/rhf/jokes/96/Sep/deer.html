I heard the basic story and indicated commentary on a local radio news 
program. Additional commentary is mine. 
<P>
<HR>
Reported on WCDR, Cedarville, Ohio, on 22 August 1996: 
<P>
"No, that isn't a new speed bump. Highway workers in an Ohio county 
recently paved over a dead deer laying on the edge of the road. 
When asked why they did it, the manager of their garage said that they 
didn't see it. The mayor of a nearby town said that the deer had been 
laying there for about three weeks. 
<P>
"The Director of the Ohio Highway Department said that it is not the 
state's policy to pave over carcasses in the road." 
<P>
And then the reporter's commentary: 
<P>
"Not the state's policy? Does this mean this has happened before?" 
<P>
And my (imaginary) follow-up story: 
<P>
The game warden for that area, when he learned of the incident, began an 
investigation to see if the highway workers had engaged in poaching. When 
he learned that the paving process involves petroleum products at high 
temperature, he closed the investigation stating that clearly the deer 
was fried, not poached. 
<P>
And my commentary: 
<P>
Will this incident cause the present law that restricts hunting from a 
vehicle to be amended to permit hunting from paving equipment? 
<P>
