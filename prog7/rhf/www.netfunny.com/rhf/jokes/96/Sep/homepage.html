Home Page for Nothing'
---------------------
(To the tune of "Money for Nothing" by Dire Straits)

Now look at them yo-yos, that's the way you do it
You write the code that runs the WebTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Get yer home page for nothin' and your hits for free.

Now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya, them guys can code
Maybe get some backing 'fore they even have a product
Maybe in a month they'll IPO.

Custom config delivery
We got to install all of these browsers
They got to all speak HTTP.

See that little doofus with the glasses and the cowlick?
Yeah buddy, that's his own code.
That little doofus got a billion options.
That little doofus he just IPO'd.

We got to install Netscape Web Servers
Custom config delivery
We got to install all of this fiber
We gonna need a big ol' T3.

I shoulda learned to code in Java
I shoulda learned some CGI
Look at that web page, they got it dancin' right across the screen.
It almost looks alive.
And what's he downloading now?  Hawaiian noises?
He's banging on that keyboard like a chimpanzee
Aw, that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Get yer home page for nothin' and your hits for free.

We got to install Netscape Web Servers
Custom config delivery
We got to install all of these proxies
They got to all speak HTTP.

Now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
You write the code that runs the WebTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Get yer home page for nothin' and your hits for free.
Home page for nothin', Hits for free.
