<PRE> Letter of Recommendation - 
<P>
       While working with Mr. Xxxxxx, I have always found him 
       working studiously and sincerely at his table without idling or 
       gossiping with colleagues in the office.  He seldom 
       wastes his time on useless things.  Given a job, he always 
       finishes the given assignment in time.  He is always 
       deeply engrossed in his official work, and can never be 
       found chitchatting in the canteen.  He has absolutely no 
       vanity in spite of his high accomplishment and profound 
       knowledge of his field.  I think he can easily be 
       classed as outstanding, and should on no account be 
       dispensed with.  I strongly feel that Mr. Xxxxxx should be 
       pushed to accept promotion, and a proposal to administration be 
       sent away as soon as possible.
