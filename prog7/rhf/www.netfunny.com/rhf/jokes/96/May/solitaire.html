<PRE>This is my own story, it just happened yesterday.
 
I recently became aware certain employee of mine (not terribly computer
literate), has developed a hopeless addiction to the Windoze Solitaire
game.  The moment I leave the office, she drops everything and starts
playing Solitaire.
 
She's been getting away with it for quite a while, as it is small place,
and there is only one person to snitch on her.  Not wanting to implicate 
my "snitch", I came up with the following solution.  I was rather proud
of myself!
 
When she clicks on the Solitaire icon, a full screen pops up with the 
following message:
 
   			FATAL SOLITAIRE ALERT
 
	You are in violation of the Microsoft Windows Solitaire
	Software/Shareware agreement.  The Solitaire program was
	designed for lite entertainment, not for wasting precious
	business hours.  You have exceeded the maximum allotted 
	time for usage between 8:00 am - 6:00 pm - local time.
 
	If you feel you have received this message in error,
	please contact your Systems Manager.
 
	Since you have been getting paid to play this game,
	you can use some of that hard earned money to register
	for the unlimited usage Shareware version by sending
	$49.95 to:
 
			Microsoft Corporation
			Shareware Division
			101 Lake Washington Blvd.
			Redmond, WA  96016
 
	You will receive a key file in the mail.
	We trust you will do the right thing.
 
 
Needless to say, she was very quiet, with a scared look about her.  I
trust this will solve the problem.  I just hope she doesn't send
fifty bucks to the phony address I made up.
