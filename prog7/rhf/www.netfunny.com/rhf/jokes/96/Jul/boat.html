<PRE>Once there were twin brothers by the name of Jones. John was married and Joe
was single. The single brother, Joe, was the proud owner of a dilapidated row 
boat. It happened that John Jones' wife died the same day that Joe's rowboat 
filled with water and sunk.

A few days later, a kindly old lady met Joe, and mistaking him for John said:
"Oh, Mr Jones, I'm sorry to hear of your great loss. You must feel terrible."

Joe smiled and said: "Well, I'm not a bit sorry! She was rather old from the 
start. Her bottom was all chewed up, and she smelled of dead fish. Even the 
first time I got into her, she made water faster than anything I ever saw.
She had a bad crack, and a pretty big hole in her front, and that hole got 
bigger every time I used her. It got so I could handle her, but if anyone 
else used her, she leaked like anything. But what finished her was four guys
from the other side of town. They came down looking for a good time and asked 
if I would lend her to them. I warned them she wasn't so hot, but they could 
take a crack at her if they liked. Well, the result was the crazy fools tried
to get inside her all at once, and it was too much for her. She cracked right
up the middle.

Before he could finish, the old lady fainted.
