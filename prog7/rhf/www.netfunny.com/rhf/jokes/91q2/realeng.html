size.

Real Engineers repair their own cameras, telephones, tele- visions, watches,
and automatic transmissions.

Real Engineers say "It's 70 degrees Farenheit, 25 degrees Celius, and 298
degrees Kelvin" and all you say is "Isn't it a nice day"

Real Engineers give you the feeling you're having a con- versation with a dail
tone or busy signal.

Real Engineers wear badges so they don't forget who they are. Sometimes a note
is attached saying "Don't offer me a ride today. I drove my own car".

Real Engineers' politics run towards acquiring a parking  space with their
name on it and an office with a window.

Real Engineers know the "ABC's of Infrared" from A to B.

making a bird bath.
