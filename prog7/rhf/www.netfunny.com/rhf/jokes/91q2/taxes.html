<P>
Line 1.  Butter, a minimum of half a pound (8 oz.), but not to exceed 1 (one) 
pound. (See line 4.) 
<P>
Line 2.   Sugar, light brown or white, unless you or your spouse 
had a financial account in a foreign country in 1990, in which case 
dark brown sugar must be used. Do not substitute molasses or honey. 
Use 1 (one) cup and adjust to taste. 
<P>
Line 3.   Eggs, six or half a dozen, whichever is greater. 
<P>
Line 4.   Semisweet chocolate, 6 oz. Nonfarm families may choose 
the optional method of using cocoa powder. If you elect the Cocoa 
Method, add 1/2 oz. (One Tablespoon) of butter to each 3 
tablespoons of cocoa. Multiply by .9897 per ounce of substitution. 
For adjustments to sugar, see pg. 29. Add total of additional 
butter to Line 1 (above). Sugar adjustments should be reflected in 
final total of Line 2. For additional details on cocoa conversion, 
see Form 551. 
<P>
Line 5a.  Flour, white. If you were a federal, state or local 
government employee, you may be eligible for an excess flour tax 
credit. Measure 2 cups, sifting is optional. 
<P>
Line 5b.  Flour, whole wheat, 1 2/3 cups. 
<P>
Line 5c.  Alternative mixture: 1 cup white flour plus 3/4 cup whole 
wheat flour. 
<P>
Line 6.   Vanilla, 1 teaspoon. See Schedule ZE for reporting use 
of imitation vanilla flavoring. You may be able to deduct the cost 
of real vanilla extract in 1991 if you itemize deductions. 
<P>
Line 7.   Salt, 1/3 teaspoon (optional). If you are a head of 
household with dependents and were born during a leap year, you 
must add salt. 
<P>
Line 8.   Baking powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons. Use of baking soda will 
result in a penalty. See form W-Q. 
<P>
Line 8a.  Walnuts, 8 oz., chopped. You may 
be eligible to use pecans or almonds. See Part III of Schedule PE, Itemized 
Substitutions. 
<P>
Line 9.   Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (375 if altitude exceeds 
5,500 feet). Be sure that you have turned the oven on before you 
begin assembling ingredients. In a bowl (2 quart capacity), cream 
butter and sugar for 3 minutes, or until well blended, whichever 
occurs first. (Note: If you are using the Nonfarm Cocoa Method [see 
Line 4], add additional butter and sugar at this point.) 
<P>
Line 10.  Incorporate eggs, one egg at a time, into creamed 
mixture. If the eggs are from a farm of which you are the sole 
owner, you may be eligible for a Fowl Credit. See Form 9871m "For 
the Birds." 
<P>
Line 11.  Add vanilla. 
<P>
Line 12.  In a double boiler, melt chocolate at low heat. If you 
are using the Nonfarm Cocoa Method, disregard the preceding 
instruction and stir cocoa into the creamed mixture. Then stir in 
flour from Line 5a, 5b, or 5c, add salt (optional, but see Line 7 
for exception) and baking powder. 
<P>
Line 13.  Add nuts, which should be chopped, regardless of type 
(See Line 8a). 
<P>
Line 14.  Pour batter into 2 (two) greased and floured 8 inch 
round cake pans or 1 (one) greased and floured 9x13 inch pan, which you 
should have prepared earlier. Bake in preheated oven (see line 
9) for 40 to 50 minutes, whichever is greater. After removing cake 
pan(s) from oven, cool for 10 minutes (12 for 9x13 pan) and turn 
cake(s) out onto wire rack. 
When cake is completely cool, frost it. (To determine time needed 
for cooling, complete Worksheet on pg. 25.) See Form 873 for 
details on appropriate frostings. 
Note: If you weigh 20 percent more (or higher) than your ideal 
weight (see chart on pg. 19), ignore this recipe and complete 
Schedule F, "Fresh Fruit Desserts." 
<P>
Happy Taxes!
