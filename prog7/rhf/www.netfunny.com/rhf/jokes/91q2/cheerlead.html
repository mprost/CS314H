[This was heard on KTSR 92.1 FM in Bryan/College Station this morning.]

A Houston newspaper carried a story recently that told of a young girl that
was trying out for a position on a cheerleading squad at a Harris County
High School.  The paper also told of another girl who was really good that
the first girl had to beat in order to get the only position on the squad.

The mother of the first girl really wanted her daughter to make the squad and
decided to go to any length to accomplish this.  So she decided to hire a 
hit man to `rub out' both the other girl <b>AND</b> her mother!

The law enforcement officers of Harris County get wind of this, and place
one of their officers in as the hit man.  The officer meets with the mother
and after finding out what she has done, tells her a price for getting the
job done.  The mother exclaims that she doesn't have <b>that</b> kind of money.
But the officer says, well, for today only we will have a 1/2-price special,
and the mother agrees (she had to hock a diamond right to pay for the deal).

Well, the officer idetifies himself and arrests her for Solicitation of
Capital Murder.  But the kicker to this story was that during the indictment
hearing, it was revealed that there were actually 2 spots open on the 
cheerleading squad.
