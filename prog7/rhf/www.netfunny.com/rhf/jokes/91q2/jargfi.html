The Pentagon held a news conference last night to fully explain some of the 
military jargon that were being used in official news releases during the 
Gulf War. 
<P>
<B>CDHU</B>--Collateral damage humanoid units--people who get in the way. Not 
that we're purposely aiming at them, but let's face it, it's no 
loss really as they probably aren't Christians and most don't even 
speak English. That's what comes of not being born on the right 
side, in a God-fearing country; serves 'em right, really. 
<P>
<B>FM</B>--Friendly missile--one of ours. The Allies had friendly missiles 
fired from planes and ships pounding the Iraqi forces continuously. 
Friendly missiles are identified by a big smiling face painted on 
the warhead. Damage as a result of friendly missiles will now be 
known as "friendly damage," and the explosives inside the warhead 
are known as "friendly explosives." 
<P>
<B>NWISSBM</B>--Nasty-wasty Iraqi scum-sucking bastard missile--one of theirs 
<P>
<B>OTRCNNXF</B>--Off The Record CNN Exclusive False-report--given to CNN by us 
so that Saddam will believe it to be the gospel truth. Neat, eh? 
<P>
<H4>New Allied Weaponry</H4>
<P>
The Pentagon has announced the deployment of selected recently developed 
weapons in the Gulf; part of the US Government's continuing commitment to 
support Allied forces with the latest technology: 
<P>
The <B>SKM</B>--Shit-Kicker Missile. When this baby hits them Iraqis, the shit 
really hits the fan! 
<P>
<B>FBT</B>--Fucking-big tank. This tank is 150 feet wide and 200 feet long, and 
it's purpose was to make the ground war much simplified by simply 
running over enemy soldiers. Special decapitation implements on 
the underside of the tank helped ensure Allied victory. In normal 
circumstances an Allied RCM (Refuge Collection Module) followed 
behind, preventing any environmental damage to the desert by 
scooping up the human blood 'n' guts. 
<P>
<B>TXjet</B>--Specially developed fighter/bomber for use by Texan pilots. It has 
an enlarged cockpit to cope with their hats. 
<P>
<B>BVM</B>--now installed in all troop-transport planes, the BVM (Burger Vending 
Machine) now features the new IraqiBurger for only $1.45; it helps 
our forces feel at home. To fully simulate a Florida McDonald's 
environment a computer-controlled rifle installed in the plane can 
be programmed to fire at random. 
<P>
<B>FMFM</B>--the FM installed Friendly Missile--so called because it has a 
built-in FM stereo receiver which plays the "Star Spangled Banner" 
as it explodes into its target.
