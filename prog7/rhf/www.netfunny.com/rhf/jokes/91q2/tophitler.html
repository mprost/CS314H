The following began life as a Top Ten list of "Mistakes Made by Adolf Hitler." 
it was passed around during a lecture in a political science class of mine and 
soon grew to over 100 entries. I have culled out the stupid and/or truly 
offensive ones, as well as any that said nasty things about any particular 
nationality (read, the French.) You'll have to excuse the fact that some 
of them are rather obscure, but that's what happens when you get a bunch of 
political scientists in the same room. Without further ado, I give you...
