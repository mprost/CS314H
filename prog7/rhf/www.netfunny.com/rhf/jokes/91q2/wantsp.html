My brother used to be a police officer in Chicago.  (He's now a rather 
high-up muckity-muck in the police dept., but that's beside the point.) 
He's told me some amusing anecdotes from Chicago police-work. 
<P>
There was one story about people shoveling the snow for a parking space 
in front their house.  This apparently is a problem for the Chicago 
police every winter.  What happens is that somebody will park in a 
nearby parking lot, then slave away for how ever many hours it takes to 
shovel out a car-sized space in front of his house, naturally so he can 
park his car there.  Then he goes back to the lot to get his car. 
<P>
When he returns home, he finds that the space has been taken by some 
_other_ car.  He is, well, upset. 
<P>
What most people do is write nasty notes etc. and place them on the 
windshield of the offending vehicle.  Where the police get involved, 
however, is the occasional case where the individual vents his wrath 
in somewhat more violent means.  Tires and throats have been slashed 
over this. 
<P>
One time a fellow got creative.  Instead of doing the usual nasty, he 
got out his garden hose and watered the automobile down, really well.  I 
mean, very, very thoroughly.  The water, of course, froze solid.  When 
the owner returned, instead of a car, he found a car-sized popsicle. 
<P>
The note on the car read: "You want the space?  Here, it's yours until 
spring!" 
<P>
