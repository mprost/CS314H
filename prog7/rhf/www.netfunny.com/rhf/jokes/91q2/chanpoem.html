The following lines have, apparently been circulating round Strasbourg 
and parts of the financial community.  The author is anonymous but 
clearly an Englishman!.

<P>
There'll be carloads of Louises        There'll be Swedes of charmless candour 
From Parisian stripteases                 Coming over to philander, 
Importing foul diseases                Spreading left-wing propaganda 
Into Kent.                              About wealth. 
There'll be modern French Wells Fargoes     Belgian girls of vast proportions 
Sending juggernauts with cargoes        Who have failed to take precautions 
Of frogslegs and escargots                Driving over for abortions 
And men's scent.                           On the Health. 
<P>
There'll be Dutchmen too, by jingo,          There'll be Spanish senoritas 
Who'll refuse to speak the lingo,           Jamming all our parking meters 
Coming over for the bingo                With their miserable pesetas 
And the dogs.                           (I don't know !). 
And through this umbilical,                 And senoras doing sambas 
Seeking knickers from St. Michael,          Shouting "vamos" and "caramba" 
Girls from Rotterdam will cycle             And believing that the amber 
In their clogs.                          Light means "Go." 
<P>
There'll be Danes on every corner         There'll be Austrians with poodles 
Faces pink after a sauna,               Wanting membership of Boodles 
trying hard to sell us porno             Then demanding apple strudels 
Graphic books.                           With their tea. 
There'll be men like Julius Caesar          There'll be lecherous Kuwaitis 
Getting in without a visa                Driving lorryloads of Katies 
Careless architects from Pisa            From the Thames to the Euphrates 
Bloody crooks.                                C.O.D. 
<P>
There'll be wealthy German campers          There'll be men from Lithuania 
With enormous picnic hampers                From Rumania and Albania 
Full of sauerkraut and champers            From Tasmania and Pennsylvania 
And pork pies.                            I've no doubt. 
There'll be Eyeties slick and smarmy,           So, dear immigration panel 
Reared on pizza and salami,           Boys in sports jackets and flannel, 
Turning up at Veeraswamy             Please protect our English Channel 
Without ties.                            Throw them out!.
