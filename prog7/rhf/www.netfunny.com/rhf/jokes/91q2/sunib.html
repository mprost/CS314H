This story was originally posted to alt.cyberpunk.chatsubo, a group 
that consists of stories of a dystopia of high tech and street violence based 
on William Gibson's novel "Neuromancer".... 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
"I see a fat man with a white beard lying in the alley, tiny reindeer 
chewing at his corpse.  I see a dead reindeer, rats tearing at its flesh.  I 
see a dead rat, maggots crawling over it.  I see a maggot that is looking a bit 
under the weather. 
<P>
"I see the stringy sinews of the gleaming pus from the running sore 
of Christmas...." 
<P>
The carol continued to play on the televid monitor on the wall above 
the bar.  For hours the visuals had consisted only of a log burning in a 
fireplace, but the fire had gotten out of control and spread into the studio, 
engulfing the video equipment. 
<P>
A man with a long black ponytail and soft black clothing sat at the 
bar.  His name was Soo Ni Buffalo.  He was of Japanese and Native American 
origin, a heritage that bequeathed to him extraordinary quickness, agility, and 
balance.  At a large public university in upstate New York, he had become 
expert in the ancient art of hand combat, Kung Pow.  Such was his mastery that 
he was chosen to wear the outfit of his school's mascot, the Kung Pow Chicken. 
<P>
Soo Ni Buffalo had taken the path of Kung Pow, a weaponless art.  His 
brother Soo Ni Stony Brook chose to study the new technologies of combat.  He 
had once created the ultimate adhesive, but he couldn't get it out of the 
bottle.  Then he created a monofilament strand of diamond so strong and yet so 
thin that it could cut through any substance when a very slight pressure was 
applied.  Unfortunately, the weight of the monofilament strand was enough to 
create a very slight downward pressure, so the strand cut through the table, 
the floor, the foundation, and the bedrock.  As far as anyone knew, the strand 
was still oscillating about the gravitational center of the earth.  Soo Ni 
Buffalo eschewed his brother's gadgetry in favor of instinctive human ability. 
<P>
On the monitor, he watched fire destroy the video studio until the 
visual signal turned to static.  Then he pressed a button on a hand-held 
transmitter, which emitted a small burst of radio waves.  The burst was picked 
up by one of the many transceivers of the I'veFallenAndICan'tGetUpNet, sent up 
to their comsat, bounced off their lunar repeater installation, boosted down 
to the Very Very Very Large Antenna Array, and relayed to the monitor that 
Soo Ni Buffalo was watching, where it caused the channel to change. 
<P>
The monitor now showed a man in a gray suit and ceramic hair, speaking 
to the camera. 
<P>
"Around the world in 30 seconds, this is CNN Headline News.  Tonight's 
top stories:  Police crack down.  Leaders urge restraint.  Comment sparks 
controversy.  Costs overrun estimates.  Committee issues call for action. 
Candidate claims mandate. 
<P>
"In business news:  Supply interacts with demand; Wall street panics. 
<P>
"In sports:  Oh, how the mighty have fallen. 
<P>
"And finally, we happened to notice this story:  Even in this day and 
age, some people still do something the old-fashioned way. 
<P>
"To recap tonight's top story:  Events transpire." 
<P>
While Soo Ni Buffalo watched the monitor, two hyped-up street-hardened 
razorboys came up behind him.  Their arms and legs were padded by heavy slabs 
of black rubber armored underneath by steel belts.  The slabs were embedded 
with metal studs and had angry angular patterns like long lightning bolts 
gouged deeply into their surface.  Chains had been strapped to the surface of 
the slabs. 
<P>
Soo Ni Buffalo's 360-degree peripheral vision warned of the two figures 
behind him, and he turned to them slowly.  He recognized the uniform of 
The Radials, a tough gang that lives on the street. 
<P>
One razorboy screamed, "Change the channel back." 
<P>
Soo Ni murmured evenly, "The previous channel had no picture.  It was 
only snow." 
<P>
The razorboys growled, "We like snow!" 
<P>
Then they went for it.  They made their play.  They made their move. 
They stepped over the line.  They tossed the dice.  They cast the die.  They 
cast two dice, and then tossed them.  There was no turning back now. 
<P>
Soo Ni slid off the bar stool, assessing the weapons they'd drawn: 
Triple rotary, floating heads, 800 rpm, sideburn attachment.  Cartridge-loaded 
double-bladed disposable safety, lubricating strip. 
<P>
One fighter leaped at Soo Ni.  He ducked, and the attacker jumped over 
him.  He sailed over the bar and into a rack of bottles, where the broken glass 
caused severe tire damage. 
<P>
The remaining fighter charged.  Soo Ni could have ducked again, but 
then no lesson would have been taught.  He blocked the weapon away, reached 
into the attacker's mouth, pulled out his heart, stuffed it with cheese, put it 
back, and watched him die of arteriosclerosis before he could make another 
move. 
<P>
Soo Ni Buffalo remounted his bar stool.  The room was silent except for 
the audiovisual monitor. 
<P>
"Tonight's top stories:  Dictator appeased.  Fears quelled.  Arson 
suspected.  Dozens injured.  Gaps widen.  Deficits loom...." 
<P>
