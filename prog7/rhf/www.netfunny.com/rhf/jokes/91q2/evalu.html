One of the joys of being an intro computer science instructor is the 
pleasure of being evaluated by undergrads on a quarterly basis.  Below 
are a few of my favorites from among the many insightful comments I have 
received. 
<P>
Winter 1991: 
<P>
"Jeff made CIS 211 interesting.  This is no small feat..." 
<P>
"Compared to what I was told about you, you are better than I expected." 
<P>
Autumn 1990: 
<P>
"I think in the future you should find an instructor who knows all 
about Macs and who likes them." --I'd rather use a better computer 
than a different instructor, but to each his own. 
<P>
"Difficult course matter, takes a lot more than just class time to 
learn." --I guess a number of courses don't require any time outside 
class. 
<P>
"Tried to be funny--wasn't." 
<P>
Spring 1989: 
<P>
"...he made the best out of an unbearable situation." 
<P>
"Incredibly boring." --Up until then, I hadn't realized I had a 
credibility problem. 
<P>
"Jeff reminds me of Chevy Chase....  I'm real glad he speaks English-- 
that's hard to find at OSU"--I was really hoping to be compared to 
Steve Martin or Gerald Ford. 
<P>
"You're a great teacher, but I hate this class." 
<P>
"Maybe an eraser fight is in your future." 
<P>
