Does smoking cause brain damage? 
<P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
The imperious, impervious, and impecunious Oracle will provide you with 
multiple answers to your question, at no extra charge. 
<P>
1)  No.  Brain damage causes smoking. 
<P>
2)  No.  Lung damage and heart damage usually get you first. 
<P>
3)  No  iv smoked for teh last thurty yeers ad it hasnt damagd my brane 
yet. 
<P>
4)  No, at least no worse than taking hits off your car's exhaust pipe 
does. 
<P>
5)  No, as long as it's done by other people in other places. 
<P>
6)  No.  By the time a salmon gets smoked, it's already dead. 
<P>
7)  No, unless your dad catches you. 
<P>
8)  No, unless the smoking is done by a pistol aimed at your cranium. 
<P>
9)  No, there's (*snicker*) never been scientific (*teehee*) proof 
(*guffaw*). 
<P>
10) No, smoking doesn't brain damage people.  People brain damage 
people, by manufacturing cigarettes. 
<P>
You owe the Oracle a pair of scissors and a water pistol.

Why does a fierce green snake always bar the way?

Why does a fierce green snake always bar the way? 
<P>
You've obviously been playing too many of those adventure games from 
Infocom! 
<P>
The one to which you are referring, I believe, deals with computer 
programming.  Called "Wizard Simulator," it is about a huge 
macrocomputer that starts to simulate the real world.  Unfortunately, 
the simulated world includes itself and thousands of people, including 
you, who you must release somehow into the real world. 
<P>
Let me boot this program on my PC and see if I can help you...

OUTSIDE YOUR CUBICLE 
You stand in a field of cubicles.  As far as you can see, there neat 
rows of offices with no tops and no privacy.  Your office is to the 
East.  The restroom is to the West.  A water cooler stands here, 
complete with Dixie cups. 
<P>
&gt; GO WEST. 
<P>
INSIDE YOUR CUBICLE 
This cramped office holds a chair, personal workstation, and several 
manuals.  Outside your cubicle, your boss walks by.  The workstation is 
off. 
<P>
&gt; TURN WORKSTATION ON. 
<P>
I do not know how to turn a workstation. 
<P>
&gt; TURN ON WORKSTATION. 
<P>
Your sexual advances are ignored by the workstation. 
<P>
&gt; PRESS START BUTTON ON WORKSTATION. 
<P>
I do not know the word 'button'.  Your boss walks by your cubicle. 
<P>
&gt; ON. 
<P>
What would you like to on? 
<P>
&gt; WORKSTATION 
<P>
You are now on top of your workstation, crouching just under the low 
ceiling.  Up here, where you have never noticed before, is a small vent 
leading upwards. 
<P>
&gt; GO UP. 
<P>
A fierce green snake bars your way! 
<P>
&gt; KILL SNAKE WITH MANUAL. 
<P>
You take the manual.  You swat the snake with the manual, but it does 
not seem to do any good.  Your boss walks by your cubicle.  "Hey you 
idiot, what the hell are you doing?"  Your boss takes out a cattle prod 
and leans over to zap you!! 
<P>
* * * YOU HAVE DIED * * * 
Score 0 out of a possible 355. 
<P>
Hmm.  The Oracle is kind of stuck here, too.  I suggest moving the water 
cooler into your office and standing on it holding the workstation. 
Your boss won't dare zap you when you are carrying such an expensive 
piece of equipment.  Instead, he will miss you and hit the snake.  Good 
luck! 
<P>
The Oracle suggests you try this in real life before risking your 
character in the game.

What is Zeno's Paradox? 
If you don't know don't answer at all! 
<P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
Zeno's paradox is best illustrated as follows:  I'll give you half of 
the answer to your question-- 
<P>
&gt; Zeno was a famous Greek philosopher who attempted to prove that motion 
does not exist.  The most famous of his paradoxes goes like this: 
Suppose we want to move from point A to point B.  We do so by moving 
to a point halfway between A and B, then to another p 
<P>
Then half of the remaining answer to your question-- 
<P>
&gt; oint halfway between there and B, and to another point halfway between 
there and B, and so on and so on.  As you can see, since t 
<P>
And half of the next part-- 
<P>
&gt; here is always some distance left between the point we're at and 
<P>
And the next part-- 
<P>
&gt;  point B, we never get to point 
<P>
And the next-- 
<P>
&gt; B.  Hence, motio 
<P>

The Muse of Programming has left me, and I can't even remember how to 
use the ++ operator.  What can I do to restore my talents? 
<P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
Well, first of all, you have got to apologise!  The Muse was round my 
place this morning, and let me tell you, she was in a foul mood!  What 
on earth propmted you to say all that stuff about Ada being a great 
language?  I mean, you really know how to hurt someone, don't you? 
<P>
There aren't many ways to appease her at the moment, but here are a few 
friendly suggestions (and I'm only telling you for her sake, you 
understand - she's a <B>very</B> good friend, if you see what I mean ...) 
<P>
1) Throw away all your books on Ada (and Pascal, for that matter). 
Trash all the compilers you can find that don't accept postfix AND 
prefix operators (The Muse likes a bit of variety in her sex life). 
Get the fastest optimising C compiler you can, and set it up to 
compile and execute the following program 32767 times: 
<P>
<!--  m-->

   #define CRAWL_NO 256

   char **argv; 
   { 
      int crawling=0; 
      for(crawling=0; crawling&gt;CRAWL_NO; crawling++) { 
                                              /* THATS how you use */ 
          abase(ME);                          /* ++ (postfix ...)  */ 
          castigate(ME); 
          humble(ME); 
          humiliate(ME,whip(),beat()); 
          buy(expensive_toy()); 
          buy(leatherwear()); 
          buy(choc_chip_ice_cream()); 
          buy(red_roses(12)); 
      } 
      printf(stdnationalnewspaper,"I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!n"); 
      printf(stdlocalpaper,"%s is truly sorry, Muse.  Truly sorry!n," 
             my_name()); 
   } 
</PRE>
<P>
2) Cover your body with green paint, shave off all your hair, and paint 
the bald patches red.  Stand out in the snow until you turn blue 
underneath.  Shout at the top of your voice "Oh Muse of Programming! 
I apologise!  Please, please, please come back!  I promise I won't 
complain when you beat me at Tetris!  I'll do anything for you!  I 
was a bad bad bad boy!  I'll never even look at another programming 
language again!  Countess Ada Lovelace means nothing to me!  It was 
all a mistake!  I'll do anything!"  If you're lucky, she'll come 
back.  And expect to have to keep that last promise ... we were 
discussing things she'd like to do to you over toast this morning, 
and at least two things she came up with curdled the milk ... 
<P>
3) Pluck out all your nostril hair and sellotape it to a listing of your 
last program together - she likes hairy coding. 
<P>
4) Become a TV Evangalist promoting the values of C and C++, and get 
everyone to send all their money to Richard Stallman.  Don't worry 
if you still don't know what ++ means, lack of Godly grace never 
stopped the religious evangalists in the past ... 
<P>
5) Go without food, drink, natural sunlight and human company for 24 
days, and spend it staring into your VDU at the diagnostic output of 
cc when trying to compile the output from a particularly good game 
of nethack.  Then figure out an effective algorithm for this year's 
version of nethackomatic, write it out in incomprehensible 
handwriting on the back of a piece of loo paper, and post it to me, 
here.  If it's any good, I think I may be able to persuade the Muse 
to nip over to help you out with such a humanitarian project. 
<P>
Basically, you see, she does like you quite a lot (and quite often going 
by what I've heard...) but you have really upset her pride.  She was 
considering sleazing it down to the CS labs and picking up some spotty 
adloscent short-sighted fresher, and teaching him all about life (well, 
C and USENET, anyway) just to spite you, but I've convinced her to wait 
just a few days so that you can prove that you are really sorry. 
Of course, if you're not, then we're going to send around Butch, the 
net.vicious.rottweiler.god, who will eat your testicles and typing 
fingers up to the wrist. 
<P>
Good luck, and may you make the right decisions! 
<P>
You owe the Oracle an optimising compiler that detects benckmarks, and 
compiles down to a single NOP every single time.  And a banana.

Never mind; you've got a busy day ahead of you: 
<P>
07:30am:  Wake up 
<P>
07:45am:  Shower, apply makeup.  Decide that you hate makeup, change. 
<P>
08:20am:  Get dressed.  Decide you hate clothing choices, change. 
<P>
09:07am:  Arrive just in time for your OBGYN appointment.  You've 
brought along a set of woolen slippers so that the stirrups aren't 
<I>quite</I> so cold, an entire back year of <I>Scientific American</I> for 
the wait in the lobby, and an electric cattle prod just in case 
the doctor even <I>thinks</I> about using an unheated speculum on you. 
<P>
10:22am:  He did use the unheated speculum, but the cattle prod was 
out of reach.  After a thorough and humiliating exam, he told you 
that it was all in your head, women are often like that, and that 
the visit cost you $127.22. 
<P>
11:30am:  Lunch, early.  Deflect pass from computer science dweeb.  At 
least, you assume it was a pass:  He came up, tried to speak (but 
only stuttered) while staring at your breasts, hands shaking so 
badly that he was knocking ice cubes out of his drink onto your 
shoes. 
<P>
1:00pm:  Study in library.  Jock comes up, sits next to you, pretends 
to study (you notice book is upside down), puts hand on thigh. 
You move.  He follows.  You leave library.  He follows, but is 
distracted by another female student in imperceptably shorter 
skirt. 
<P>
2:30pm:  Drop off project in TA's office.  He tells your breasts (why 
do men never speak to you directly?) that he might just lose the 
project unless you gave him something to remember you by.  You 
inquire if a sexual harrassment lawsuit would be sufficiently 
memorable.  He turns red, muttering how women have no sense 
of humor.  You leave. 
<P>
2:45pm to 6:45pm:  Work on next project in terminal room.  Excepting 
stares (computer science types must grow up on a planet without 
women, you decide), you are undisturbed. 
<P>
7:30pm:  You arrive back at home to find message from boyfriend 
cancelling date.  You start running a bath. 
<P>
7:50pm:  You get another phone call from boyfriend, telling you his 
plans fell through and could you two still get together?  With 
a sigh, you agree, and let the water out of the tub. 
<P>
8:45pm:  He arrives, you leave for dinner. 
<P>
10:00pm:  You return after a pleasant dinner.  Necking on couch 
follows. 
<P>
10:15pm:  Complete undress achieved.

as being too noisy, and run a bath instead.

Oh Magnificent Oracle, whose wisdom teeth impact the whole world with 
dental agony, 
<P>
I haven't had a dental checkup in ten years.  Is it worth it to go in, 
or should I just blow my jaw off with a shotgun and be done with dental 
floss once and for all?

<P>
Comparison of Dental Checkup Techniques:  A Field Study by the Oracle, 
MD, DDS, PHD, MS, BS, CPA, and a BMF besides. 
<P>
One hundred mortal subjects were selected based on their lack of dental 
checkups over a period no less than five years previous to this date. 
This was accomplished by the convenient method of rounding up people 
found in college computer labs on Friday and Saturday nights, and giving 
those people Breathalyzer(TM) tests.  Those for whom the Breathalyzer 
machine turned sickly green were selected as subjects. 
<P>
Fifty of the subjects were selected at random to receive a dental 
checkup via Method A (dentist), while the others received Method B 
(twelve-gauge).  The experiment was triple-blind - i.e., the subjects 
did not know at any time which treatment they were receiving, the 
experimenters did not know at any time which treatment they were 
administering, and the Oracle has consistently disavowed knowledge of 
the entire experiment. 
<P>
Criteria listed below were checked during treatment and at various times 
afterwards, as appropriate.

As is clear from the data above, Method B is superior to Method A in 
almost all respects.  Method B is less expensive, much simpler and 
quicker, and leads to far fewer complaints on the part of the patient. 
Further study is likely to reveal that Method B can be administered by a 
"dentist" with far less experience than that required by Method A - that 
is, a duck-hunting license will suffice in lieu of a DDS. 
<P>
You owe the Oracle all that dental floss you won't be needing.

The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. 
Your question was: 
<!-- Unknown %s typeface--><P>
<P>
I heard aphids are born pregnant.  Is this true? 
</PRE><P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
Yes indeed.  This is one of the many wonderous but little publicized 
facts about the Animal Kingdom.  Some others are: 
<P>
1) Carpenter ants are born constipated, DESPITE the fact that they have 
the highest percentage of dietary fiber in their diets ever recorded 
(tied for first place with termites, who, however, have no such 
digestive irregularities.) 
<P>
2) Hyenas are the only known animal with an internal supply of nitrous 
oxide.  Central African efforts to tap this natural resource to improve 
dentistry have been a disappointment, although they have had the side 
benefit that the treatment of amputated limbs is now much better 
understood. 
<P>
3) Humpback whales are born with a fluent command of English, French, 
Spanish, German, Russian, and seventeen other human languages(fnord). 
The fluty sing-song language they use when in the presence of humans is 
due to a misunderstanding caused by the fact that the whales' first 
human contact was with a Swiss Yodeler. 
<P>
4) North American salmon have only recently begun swimming up mountain 
streams to spawn.  They were, in fact, perfectly happy to do their 
spawning in the sea before a blitz advertising campaign by Coors Beer on 
network TV convinced them that no young, vibrant fish would be caught 
dead in anything but Rocky Mountain spring water. 
<P>
Other such interesting facts can be found in Imaginitive Pseudoscience 
Magazine, but you owe the Oracle a year's subscription to Omni instead: 
it's a little more entertaining and less rigorous than IPM.
