&gt;Subject: I miss you.<BR>
<P>
TO MY DARLING HUSBAND,<BR>
<P>
</PRE>I am sending you this letter via this BBS 
communications thing, so that you will be sure to 
read it.  Please forgive the deception, but I 
thought you should know what has been going on at 
home since your computer entered our lives TWO 
YEARS AGO.  The children are doing well.  Tommy is 
seven now and is a bright, handsome boy.  He has 
developed quite an interest in the arts.  He drew 
a family portrait for a school project, all the 
figures were good, and the back of your head is 
very realistic.  You should be very proud of him. 
<P>
Little Jennifer turned three in September.  She 
looks a lot like you did at that age.  She is an 
attractive child and quite smart.  She still 
remembers that you spent the whole afternoon with 
us on her birthday.  What a grand day for Jenny, 
despite the fact that it was stormy and the 
electricity was out. 
<P>
I am doing well.  I went blonde about a year ago, 
and discovered that it really is more fun! 
George, I mean, Mr. Wilson the department head, 
has uh, taken an interest in my career and has 
become a good friend to us all. 
<P>
I discovered that the household chores are much 
easier since I realized that you didn't mind being 
vacuumed but that feather dusting made you sneeze. 
The house is in good shape.  I had the living room 
painted last spring; I'm sure you noticed it.  I 
made sure that the painters cut holes in the drop 
sheet so you wouldn't be disturbed. 
<P>
Well, my dear, I must be going.  Uncle George, uh, 
Mr. Wilson, I mean, is taking us all on a ski trip 
and there is packing to do.  I have hired a 
housekeeper to take care of things while we are 
away, she'll keep things in order, fill your 
coffee cup and bring your meals to your desk, just 
the way you like it.  I hope you and the computer 
will have a lovely time while we are gone.  Tommy, 
Jenny and I will think of you often.  Try to 
remember us while your disks are booting. 
<P>
Love, Karen 
<P>
