A young Jewish boy starts attending public school in a small town. The teacher 
of the one-room school decides to use her position to  try to influence the 
new student.  She asks the class, "Who was the  greatest man that ever lived?" 
<P>
A girl raises her hand and says, "I  think George Washington was the greatest 
man that ever lived because he is the Father of our country."  The teacher 
replies, "Well...that's a good answer, but that's not the answer I am looking 
for." 
<P>
Another  young student raises his hand and says, "I think Abraham 
Lincoln was the greatest man that lived because he freed the slaves and helped 
end the  civil war." ... "Well, that's another good answer, but that is not 
the one I was looking for." 
<P>
Then the new Jewish boy raises his hand and 
says, "I think Jesus Christ was the greatest man that ever lived." The 
teacher's mouth drops open in astonishment.  "Yes!" she says,  "that's the 
answer I was looking for."  She then brings him up to the  front of the 
classroom and gives him a lollipop. 
<P>
Later, during recess, another Jewish boy 
approaches him as he is licking his lollipop.  He says, "Why did you say, 
'Jesus Christ'?"  The boy stops licking his lollipop  and replies, "I know 
it's Moses, and YOU know it's Moses, but business is business."
