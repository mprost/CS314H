Those of you in California have surely heard the Unocal commercials which have 
some grease monkey from Unocal actually making house calls to do maintenance 
or check the oil or whatever.  Our new slogan is "At Unocal, We're Still a 
SERVICE Station."  Well, maybe at some stations.  The Unocal I work at is a 
self-serve only and I spend my whole shift in a bullet-resistant glass box. 
(BTW, if "bullet-resistant glass" is to "bullet-proof glass" what "water- 
resistant watches" are to "water-proof watches" then I don't feel terribly 
safe...) 
<P>
Anyway, to spruce up our customer relations, Unocal sent our booth a workbook 
entitled "Customer Oriented Marketing:  Deliver the Attitude."  It is basically 
a quiz-book testing all of the booth attendants on how to treat our beloved 
customers.  The boss is supposed to test us all using the book and presumably 
our job depends on a good score. 
<P>
Not just any dummy can walk in off the street and become a booth attendant at 
Unocal. 
<P>
For the enjoyment of the reading audience, I here present a few sample 
questions from the workbook: 
<P>
<STRONG>[Ed: The quiz is pretty amusing, but I have also added the funny cynical answers 
provided for this quiz in a later posting by Dave Decot, decot@hpcupt1.cup.hp.com]</STRONG>
