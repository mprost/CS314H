GLN (Good-Looking Nerd) :  "Can I help you?" 
<P>
MHP (Mississippi Highway Patrolman) :  "Do you know how fast you were 
going, boy?" 
<P>
GLN :  "I'm not sure.  The needle doesn't reach the high numbers very well. 
I would estimate somewhere between 80 and 85, closer to 85." 
<P>
MHP :  "You were going 84 miles an hour." 
<P>
GLN :  "See, I was close.  I must've been going uphill." 
<P>
MHP :  "What was that?" 
<P>
GLN :  "Oh, nothing.  Is there some reason you pulled me over?" 
<P>
MHP :  "I'm going to have to give you a ticket, boy." 
<P>
GLN :  "No thank you." 
<P>
MHP :  "What was that?" 
<P>
GLN :  "If it's all the same to you, I'd just as soon you keep your 
ticket.  I don't really have any use for one." 
<P>
MHP :  "Don't try to weasel your way out of this, boy.  I'm going to 
give you a ticket." 
<P>
GLN :  "What for?" 
<P>
MHP :  "WHAT FOR???  Speeding, that's what!" 
<P>
GLN :  "You mean you're going to give me a ticket for going two miles 
per hour over the speed limit?" 
<P>
MHP :  "TWO MILES???  Don't you know what the speed limit is, boy?" 
<P>
GLN :  "It's posted on the white sign with black letters, right?" 
<P>
MHP :  "Right." 
<P>
GLN :  "82.  That's what the sign said, '82.'" 
<P>
MHP :  "That's not the speed limit.  This is highway 82." 
<P>
GLN :  "I thought this was highway 55.  It goes through Winona." 
<P>
MHP :  "55 is the speed limit.  This is highway 82.  I-55 goes through 
Memphis and Jackson." 
<P>
GLN :  "But I'm going to Starkville, not Memphis or Jackson.  You must 
be confused." 
<P>
MHP :  "This is NOT I-55.  This IS highway 82, and it does go to Starkville." 
<P>
GLN :  "That's right.  I'm going to Starkville on highway 55, and the 
speed limit is 82.  I don't think you should give me a ticket for 
going two miles over the speed limit." 
<P>
MHP :  "The speed limit is 55.  Didn't you see the sign with the words 
'SPEED LIMIT' and the number '55' on it?" 
<P>
GLN :  "I was wondering why they would write that on the sign telling the 
name of the highway." 
<P>
MHP :  "It ISN'T the highway sign.  The highway is 82, and the speed limit 
is 55." 
<P>
GLN :  "Do you think you could hurry up and get to the point?  I'm kind of 
in a hurry." 
<P>
MHP :  "Is this your car?" 
<P>
GLN :  "Yes, do you like it?" 
<P>
MHP :  "Would you turn down that music?" 
<P>
GLN :  "It's Aretha Franklin.  It goes with the car, don't you think? 
What are you doing?" 
<P>
MHP :  "I'm writing you a ticket." 
<P>
GLN :  "For going two miles over the speed limit?" 
<P>
MHP :  "No, for going TWENTY-NINE miles an hour over the speed limit." 
<P>
GLN :  "Do you think that's unsafe?" 
<P>
MHP :  "Absolutely.  It's very unsafe." 
<P>
GLN :  "If I was going so fast, then how did you catch me?" 
<P>
MHP :  "Well, uh..." 
<P>
GLN :  "Do you think it's safe for you to drive that fast?" 
<P>
MHP :  "Yes.  I've been trained for high-speed pursuit." 
<P>
GLN :  "Don't you think it's rather hypocritical of you to be giving me 
a ticket?  How many wrecks have you had?" 
<P>
MHP :  "That's irrelevant." 
<P>
GLN :  "Did you see that?" 
<P>
MHP :  "What?" 
<P>
GLN :  "That black car just sideswiped your patrol car and kept going. 
If you hurry, you can probably catch him." 
<P>
MHP :  "#@*%^$!  And that's my new patrol car, too.  You wait here while 
I apprehend that criminal!" 
<P>
GLN :  "Yeah, right."
