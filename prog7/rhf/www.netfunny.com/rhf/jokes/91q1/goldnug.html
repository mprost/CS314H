<P>
I found this inside a old business card from 
Stateside Locker Club,  San Diego, CA: 
<P>
In a South American mining district Mrs. Brown presented her 
husband with a 12 pound baby boy.  Mr. Brown was so delighted that he 
went to the News office and told that he had found a 12 pound nugget of 
gold as good as any  to be found in South America.  The paper, naturally, 
sent a reporter to get particulars.  This is what happened: 
<P>
<BR>Reporter--Does Mr. Brown live here?<BR>
Mrs.Brown-- he does.<BR>
Reporter--Is he in?<BR>
Mrs.Brown--No he isn't.<BR>
Reporter--I understand he found a nugget of gold weighing 12 pounds.<BR>
Mrs.Brown--(Seeing the joke) Yes.<BR>
Reporter--Can you show me the exact location where it was found?<BR>
Mrs.Brown--I'm afraid Mr. Brown would object as it is private.<BR>
Reporter--Is the hole far from here?<BR>
Mrs.Brown--No, it is quite handy.<BR>
Reporter--Has Mr. Brown been working the claim long?<BR>
Mrs.Brown--Almost ten months.<BR>
Reporter--Was Mr. Brown the first to work it?<BR>
Mrs.Brown--He thought he was.<BR>
Reporter--Was the work difficult?<BR>
Mrs.Brown--It was at first but easier after the shaft opened.<BR>
Reporter--Is the water plentiful?<BR>
Mrs.Brown--Yes, sufficient to carry on the work.<BR>
Reporter--Has he gotten to the bottom yet?<BR>
Mrs.Brown--No, but quite near it.<BR>
Reporter--Do you think there are any more nuggets?<BR>
Mrs.Brown--Yes, if the claim is properly worked.<BR>
Reporter--Has he worked it since he found the nugget?<BR>
Mrs.Brown--No, but I told him it was time to start.<BR>
Reporter--Do you help him?<BR>
Mrs.Brown--I do my level best.<BR>
Reporter--do you think he will sell the claim?<BR>
Mrs.Brown--No, he finds too much pleasure in working it himself.<BR>
Reporter--Can I see the nugget?<BR>
Mrs.Brown--Certainly.<BR>
<P>
</PRE>She brought the baby in for inspection. The embarrassed reporter 
departed very fast.
