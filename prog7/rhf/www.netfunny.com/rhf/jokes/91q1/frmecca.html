[I have been telling this joke in Punjabi (an Indian language) 
for about 7 years.  It is probably not original, but I haven't come 
across it anywhere else, either] 
<P>
A Muslim and a Sikh were once traveling together in a train. 
Both being from Punjab, spoke the same language and had a great time 
talking to each other and generally whiling away time.  Came lunchtime 
and the Muslim took out his lunch and started eating without offering 
it to the Sikh.  The Sikh was rather insulted at this impolite behavior. 
"What city are you from?" he asked the Muslim.  "Lahore," replied the 
Muslim.  At that, the Sikh started cursing the people of Lahore, 
mentioning, among other things what impolite &amp;*@##!%%'s they all were. 
Being guilty, the Muslim swallowed all this in silence. 
<P>
A few minutes later, the Sikh was hungry and he took out his 
lunch and started eating without offering it to the Muslim.  The Muslim 
saw this as an opportunity for revenge.  "And what city might you be 
from?" he asked the Sikh. 
<P>
The Sikh replied, "I'm from Mecca.  Start cursing!"
