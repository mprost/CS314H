It's amazing how well prepared Saddam Hussein is.  In his bunker with 
him he has a heart surgeon in case something happens to his heart, a

in case something happens to his brain.

While watching the Superbowl half-time show, I saw video depicting tanks

No more supporting "our boys in the field."  Even unreconstructed

"He asked for it, he got it, it just happened not to be a Toyota," said

According to the news services, Saddam Hussein stated that he has 
committed "only a fraction of his forces." (In other words, he's 
committing only those forces that are still operational).

<H1 align=center>Saddam's Communication System...</H1>
<ADDRESS><CENTER>stuart@ihlpa.att.com</CENTER></ADDRESS><BR>
<P>
During the first press conference with Secretary Cheney 
and General Powell, one reporter asked how Saddam Hussein 
could communicate with the United States in the event that 
he would want to negotiate.  The general completely avoided 
the question. 
<P>
However, recent reports indicate a weak signal emanating from 
central Iraq.  Analysts are confirming that the voice is that 
of Saddam Hussein.  Roughly translated, the message reads 
"I'VE FALLEN... AND I CAN'T GET UP!!"

Brad, 
I asked an Austrian friend what the Blitzer in Wolf Blitzer meant, and 
he told me it meant "Flasher." He went on to explain some of the other names 
of the CNN crew: 
<P>
<PRE>	Bierbauer - Beer Farmer 
	Scherzer  - Joker 
	Begleiter - Accompianist 
</PRE><P>
</PRE>I thought that this might interest the author of joke number 2190 
who likes the inherent humor of the name "Wolf Blitzer," because it seems 
that there are quite a few other cute ones as well....

Yet another Iraq joke, told by a friend of my father's in Oakland ( I 
haven't seen it posted anywhere, but I don't read the newsgroups too 
regularly ) : 
<P>
Reports from Baghdad indicate that allied bombing raids recently 
destroyed one of the most important buildings in Iraq; the 7-Eleven 
Training Center.

I can't quite call anything that drops off a plane traveling several hundred 
miles an hour and few thousand feet in the air to dive nose first into a 
concrete wall just to explode "smart."

George Bush, Francois Mitterand and Saddam Hussein are sitting in 
a bar, drinking and bragging.

GB: If I stand on the Statue of Liberty I can see all of New York 
below me. 
<P>
FM: No big deal. If I stand on the Eiffel tower I can see all of 
Paris below me.

SH: So what? If I stand on my chair I can also see all of Baghdad 
below me...

A quote from the Wall Street Journal, 1/25/91 
<P>
As the first days of the war passed, the computer underground's 
particular brand of humor, always a bit warped, has taken a newly morbid 
tone.  An oil-worker in Khahran posted this weather forecast on Last 
Outpost (BBS): 
<P>
"Baghdad will be bright and sunny, with lows in the mid-40s and highs 
in the upper 10,000s.  Winds will be from the south, southeast, and 
southwest at 1,500-1,800 knots.  Sunscreen 300 is recommended.  Chances 
of precipitation of molten objects are 90-99%"

The Iraqi Air Force: We fly more international flights out of Baghdad than any 
other carrier in the world. 
<P>
Recently the US Air Force slogan has been changed to "Aim Low." 
<P>
US Air over-night delivery service: 
<P>
When you absolutely need to get it there over-night ...  we GUARANTEE delivery 
before 4:30 in the morning.  The US Air Force, we run the most dangerous ship 
in the shipping business.

The Navy, it's not just a job, it's an extended middle-east vacation cruise.

Despite the negative media coverage, the Iraqi ground forces are actually 
performing their task with alarming success.  Clearly, their first objective 
in the campaign is to destroy the massive coalition stockpiles of conventional 
weapons.
