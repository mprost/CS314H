The following digest contains various Iraq jokes that did not quite 
rate their own posting.  Be warned that many of these are sick, particularly 
if you're of the "the war is serious and can't possibly be funny" persuasion. 
Some are pretty nasty, possibly racist.

<PRE>Attacking planes, incoming strafes, 
No one knows, how much he'll take. 
For U.S. oil, the pilots ride, 
The sanctions failed, but hey we tried. 
Hussein's a twit, he's gotta know, 
Shamir'll launch, a Jericho. 
It's all been planned, but lips are sealed, 
I wonder why, he didn't deal! 
<P>
Oh, you like 'em whether they're a pain or a bluff, oh yeah...

Better face the facts, it seems you can't get enough, 
You know you're gonna have to face it, you're addicted to SCUDs!

How many Iraqi's does it take to screw in a light bulb? 
<P>
Four.

One to screw in the light bulb. 
<P>
One to claim that they've actually screwed in 300 light bulbs. 
<P>
One to claim that they've unscrewed 150 American light bulbs. 
<P>
And one to claim that they're screwing and unscrewing light bulbs 
for the Palestinians.

I made this one up: 
<P>
A conversation between a U.S. Official and an Iraqi Official: 
<P>
U.S. Off: 	Your treatment of POWs is against the Geneva Convention. 
This is a war crime. 
<P>
Iraqi Off:	I agree. What are you going to do? Bomb Baghdad?

(I don't think personal opinions about the war have any effect on 
the bizarreness of the juxtaposition of these stories.) 
<P>
People the world over have expressed outrage at Iraq's treatment of 
Allied pilot prisoners of war, in violation of the Geneva Conventions. 
<P>
Iraq has in turn expressed its disappointment at the fact that the 
Allied forces have been bombing the crap out of their country 
continuously since January 15th.

<P>
I received this particular message in my mail account a couple of days back, 
and thought it was rather funny.  I hope the rest of you find it as amusing. 
--PH 
<P>
<PRE> 'Twas the night before Desert-Storm 
     and all through Iraq 
 Not a weapon was stirring 
     not even a track. 
<P>
 When up, in the air, 
     there arose such a clatter 
 Saddam jumped from bed 
     to see what was the matter. 
<P>
 He whipped up the window, 
    threw open the sash-- 
 And was narrowly missed 
     by Iraqi ack-ack! 
<P>
 And what before his bloodshot eyes 
     should ensue, 
 But an attack by Eagles, 
     and some Tornadoes too. 
<P>
 In nap-of-the-earth 
     the fighters they came. 
 They bombed as they went, 
     and they kicked ass by name! 
<P>
 "Hey Mohammed! Hey Abdullah! 
     Hey Terik-the-sleaze! 
 Here's a Maverick, some Snakeyes, 
     napalm if you please!" 
<P>
 Missile batteries, command posts, 
     the pilots zapped them with ease-- 
 "Who said this was tough? 
     With Pave Tack it's a breeze!" 
<P>
 Then to the palace they turned 
     and they let their bombs fly 
 All the while screaming 
     "Death from the sky!" 
<P>
 One bomb, it was targeted 
     down the chimney and flue-- 
 Not a mean feat 
     with a Mark Eighty-two! 
<P>
 The windows, they shattered 
     the chimney, it fell 
 And Saddam cleaned his trousers 
     while the bombers raised hell. 
<P>
 The aircrews yelled back 
     as they streaked out of sight, 
 "If it makes you feel better 
     we'll be bombing all night!" 
<P>

Following OSF philosophy, the outdated SCUD isn't aimed at anything in

<P>
The press is continually referring to this as a "War."  This is not 
accurate, for two reasons: 
<P>
(1) War was never declared. 
<P>
(2) A War is where two sides shoot at and affect heavy casualties on 
each other. 
<P>
In light of this, "Turkey Shoot" would probably be more appropriate. 
<P>
Iraq claims to have shot down around 170 aircraft.  (Ours or theirs?) 
<P>
The "shot heard 'round the gulf" was a bomb dropped on the Baghdad 
PT&amp;T building, which was mistakenly identified in some reports as the 
AT&amp;T building.  This brings a whole new meaning to the term, "Reach 
out and touch someone." 
<P>
Well, I guess we're not dealing with AT&amp;T here. 
<P>
Then again, considering AT&amp;T's saturation advertising of the past several 
months, bombing the AT&amp;T building is starting to sound like a real good idea. 
<P>
Hussein's current complaint to the Allies is "the Allied planes are 
flying too high for the Iraqi anti-aircraft to shoot them down."  (Awwww.) 
<P>
The leading threat to Baghdad is anti-aircraft fire falling back down. 
<P>
The SCUD that inflicted heavy casualties on Israel surprised 
everybody, including Saddam Hussein.  He says that he was only trying 
to "disturb their sleep." 
<P>
Israel is planning to retaliate to the SCUD missile attacks.  However, 
they're having a hard time deciding how, since the Allies already took 
out all the good targets.

<H1 align=center>Allies attack "baby food" plant</H1>
<ADDRESS><CENTER>okunewck@psuvax1.cs.psu.edu (Phil OKunewick)</CENTER></ADDRESS><BR>
<P>
The Allies destroyed an Iraqi biological weapons plant, which 
Hussein claims was really a baby food plant.  (The barbed wire and 
armed garrison made the Allies suspicious, of course.) 
<P>
Actually, they're both right, considering that baby food is one of 
the primary materials used in the manufacture of biological weapons. 
<P>
Those who don't believe this have obviously never changed a diaper.

Baghdad residents are eagerly looking forward to the first few days of 
February.  They will gather around what is left of the Presidential 
Palace to see if their leader emerges from his bunker.  Unfortunately, 
predictions are he will see his shadow and return, bringing 6 more 
weeks of bombing.
