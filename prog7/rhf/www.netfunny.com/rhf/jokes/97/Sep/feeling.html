<P>
Farmer Joe decided his injuries from the accident were serious enough 
to take the trucking company (responsible for the accident) to court. 
In court the trucking company's fancy lawyer was questioning farmer 
Joe. 
<P>
"Didn't you say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine'?" said the 
lawyer. 
<P>
Farmer Joe responded, "Well I'll tell you what happened. I had just 
loaded my favorite mule Bessie into the...." 
<P>
"I didn't ask for any details," the lawyer interrupted, "just answer 
the question." "Did you not say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm 
fine'!" 
<P>
Farmer Joe said, "Well I had just got Bessie into the trailer and I 
was driving down the road...." 
<P>
The lawyer interrupted again and said, "Judge, I am trying to 
establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told 
the Highway Patrolman on the scene that he was just fine. Now several 
weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client. I believe he 
is a fraud.  Please tell him to simply answer the question." 
<P>
By this time the Judge was fairly interested in Farmer Joe's answer 
and said to the lawyer, "I'd like to hear what he has to say about his 
favoritE mule Bessie." 
<P>
Joe thanked the Judge and proceeded, "Well as I was saying, I had just 
loaded Bessie, my favorite mule, into the trailer and was driving her 
down the highway when this huge semi-truck and trailer ran the stop 
sign and smacked my truck right in the side. 
<P>
I was thrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into the other. I 
was hurting real bad and didn't want to move. However, I could hear 
ole Bessie moaning and groaning. I knew she was in terrible shape just 
by her groans. 
<P>
Shortly after the accident a Highway Patrolman came on the scene. He 
could hear Bessie moaning and groaning so he went over to her. After he 
looked at her, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. Then the 
Patrolman came across the road with his gun in his hand and looked at me. 
<P>
He said, "Your mule was in such bad shape I had to shoot her. How are 
you feeling?"
