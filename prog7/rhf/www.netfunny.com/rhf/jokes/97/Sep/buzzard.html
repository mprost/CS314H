<PRE>
A farmer wanted to have his hens serviced, so he went to the market
looking for a rooster. He was hoping he could get a special rooster-
one that service all of his many hens and when he told this to the
market vendor, the vendor replied: "I have just the rooster for you.
Randy here is the horniest rooster you will ever see!"

So the farmer took Randy back to the farm. Before setting him loose
in the hen house though, he gave Randy a little pep talk. "Randy", he
said, "I'm counting on you to do your stuff". And without a word
he strutted into the hen house.

Randy was as fast as he was furious, mounting each hen like a
thunderbolt. There was much squawking and many feathers flying, till
Randy had finished having his way with each hen. But Randy didn't stop
there, he went in to the barn and mounted all the horses, one by one
and still at the same frantic pace. Then he went to the pig house,
where he did the same. The farmer, watching all of this with
disbelief, cried out, "Stop, Randy, you'll kill yourself". But
Randy continued, seeking out each farm animal in the same manner.

Well the next morning, the farmer looked out and saw Randy lying
there on his lawn. His legs were up in the air, his eyes rolled back,
and his long tongue hanging out. A buzzard was already circling above
Randy.

The farmer walked up to Randy saying, "Oh you poor thing, look what
you did, you've gone and killed yourself. I warned you my little
buddy".

"Shhhhh," Randy whispered, "The buzzard's getting closer."
