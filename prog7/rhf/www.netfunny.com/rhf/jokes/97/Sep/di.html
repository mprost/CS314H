What follows are the better of the jokes I've received regarding the death
of Princess Diana.  They are digested because they are "lesser" jokes which
didn't warrant posting on their own.  If you are even slightly put off at
attempts to poke fun at events such as this, I <b>strongly</b> discourage you
from reading further.

Let me say that again.  If you are even slightly put off at attempts to poke
fun at events such as this, I <b>strongly</b> discourage you from reading further.

And for those of you who will read on despite my warnings and flame me as
a result, let me just say that this was the most distasteful task I've had
as RHF's moderator.  Don't think for one second that I enjoyed it, because
I didn't.

I was sitting at work today when someone said Mother Teresa had died,
without thought I popped off with:

Did you hear they're blaming a specific tabloid for Princess Diana's death?
