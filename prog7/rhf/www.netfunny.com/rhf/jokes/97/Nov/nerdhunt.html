</PRE>A truck driver is passing through New York City and stops at a bar for a 
couple of beers.  Shortly thereafter another man enters the bar, wearing 
a suit, bowler hat and bowtie, and carrying a briefcase. The bartender 
asks, "Are you a lawyer by any chance?  You sure look like one"  "Why 
yes, as a matter of fact I am," the man replies.  Without another word 
the bartender pulls out a shotgun from under the bar and blows the 
lawyer away.  The truck driver is stunned and asks the bartender for an 
explanation.  "You must be from out of town, pal.  It's lawyer season in 
New York City this time of year.  You don't even need a license." 
"Sounds like a great idea to me," agrees the truck driver, who has 
recently lost his shirt in a nasty divorce and is nursing a serious 
grudge against the legal profession. 
<P>
Upon leaving the bar, the truck driver doesn't get more than a mile down 
the street when he hits a pothole, blows a tire, and crashes his truck 
into a light pole.  While trying to extricate himself from the cab of 
his truck, he sees a growing crowd of men and women in expensive suits 
surrounding his wrecked truck, thrusting their arms in through the 
broken windshield and waving their business cards in his face, all the 
while screaming at him not to move until an ambulance arrives.  The 
truck driver reaches into his glove compartment, pulls out his handgun, 
leaps from the cab of his truck and opens fire on the now-scattering 
flock of attorneys, winging several of them in the process.  As he 
pauses to reload, a policeman arrives on the scene and orders him to 
drop his weapon.  He complies, whereupon the the officer promptly 
handcuffs him and informs him that he is under arrest.  "But they're in 
season, aren't they?" the truck driver protests.  "Well, sure, but you 
can't bait them." 
<P>
(Based on a joke my brother told me about nerd hunting in Silicon 
Valley)
