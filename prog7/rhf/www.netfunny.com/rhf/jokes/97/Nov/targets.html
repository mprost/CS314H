</PRE>[A true story.] 
<P>
Back in the summmer 1980, some friends and I toured the USS John 
Hancock, a guided missle destroyer as I recall, when it was anchored in 
the Chesapeake Bay off of Annapolis.  While we were in the forward torpedo 
room, the sailor conducting that part of the tour talked about the time 
the Hancock had played a cat-and-mouse game with a submarine on which 
then-President Carter was aboard.  The sailor said that President Carter 
was a bubble-head, and when the laughter in the crowd died down, explained 
that destroyer people referred to submariners as bubble-heads.  President 
Carter had been a submariner in the Navy. 
<P>
A few months later, my friend, Joe Closs, who was on Adm. Rickover's 
staff at the time, came to visit. I told him about the bubble-head remark 
and asked him what submariners called destroyer people.  He replied, 
"Well, I always thought that a bubble-head was a hard-hat diver, but, be 
that as it may, in the submarine service we refer to all surface ships as 
-- targets."
