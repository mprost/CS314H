<PRE>
Bill Clinton is visiting a school.  In one class, he asks the students
if anyone can give him an example of a "TRAGEDY".  One little boy
stands up and offers, "If my best friend who lives next door was playing
in the street when a car came along and killed him, that would be a
TRAGEDY."

"No," Clinton says, "That would be an ACCIDENT."

A girl raises her hand.  "If a school bus carrying fifty children drove
off a  cliff, killing everyone involved... that would be a TRAGEDY."

I'm afraid not," explains Clinton.  "That is what we would call a GREAT
LOSS."  The room is silent; none of the other children volunteer.
"What?" asks Clinton.  "Isn't there any one here who can give me an
example of a TRAGEDY?"

Finally, a boy in the back raises his hand.  In a timid voice, he
speaks:  "If an airplane carrying Bill and Hillary Clinton were blown up
by a bomb, <b>that</b> would be a TRAGEDY."

"Wonderful!" Clinton beams.  "Marvelous!  And can you tell me WHY that
would be a TRAGEDY?"

"Well," says the boy, "because it wouldn't be an ACCIDENT, and it
certainly would be no GREAT LOSS!"
