<PRE>Dear All Things Considered,

Your interview this evening with Boutros Boutros-Ghali in connection
with the publication of his new book caused me to realize how little I
had known of his career and how much I learned of it this evening, not
to mention how much I regret the departure from the world stage of the
musical and truly poetry-inspiring sound of his name.  So before his
star fades completely, I respectfully offer for your consideration this
humble attempt to immortalize the quite satisfactory rhythm and euphony
of the name of this great contributor to the cause of world peace:

Of all names that have faded
&gt;From the lore of human folly,
The one I think I miss the most
Is Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

It rang with such a pleasing note,
It made the tongue feel jolly
To trip upon the syllables
Of Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

But no pedestrian was he,
No diplomatic Pollyanna
To be taken lightly was this
Boutros Boutros-Ghali,

For it was in a time of war
'Twixt Israel and Palestinian
That one first heard the name
Of Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

Yes, it was he, old BB-G
Who helped to end the volley
Of weapon-fire 'cross No Man's Land
Bestride the Jordan Valley.

And it was he who helped to bring
Camp David's greats to parley,
To forge a peace that still becalms
Egyptian and Israeli.

So if you're ever feeling low
And sorta melancholy,
Just say a little prayer of thanks
For Boutros Boutros-Ghali!

Although he's gone, his name's still known
&gt;From Westminster to Bali; 
For even still today, one hears:
"It's Boutros!" "Boutros? Golly!"
