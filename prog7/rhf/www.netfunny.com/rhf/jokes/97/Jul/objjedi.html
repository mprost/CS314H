<PRE>A Long time Ago, in a Galaxy far, far away...

Luke:   "You used to program."
Ben:    "I was once a software engineer the same as your father."
Luke:   "My father wasn't a software engineer.  He was a custodian at
         Lockheed-Martin."
Ben:    "That's what your Uncle told you.  He didn't hold with your
         father's ideals.  He thought he should go to work. Not gotten
         a degree."
Luke:   "I wish I had known him."
Ben:    "He was a cunning object-oriented analyst, and the best systems
         programmer in the galaxy.  I understand you've become quite a
         good hacker yourself.  And he was a good friend.  For over ten
         years the systems programmers created user interfaces.  Before
         the dark times.  Before Microsoft."
Luke:   "How did my father die?"
Ben:    "A young systems programmer named Bill Gates, who was a student
         until his mommy kicked him out of her basement, founded
         Microsoft and helped destroy the intuitive user interface.  He
         betrayed and murdered the Macintosh.  Gates was seduced by the
         Dark Side of Money."
Luke:   "Money?"
Ben:    "Yes, Money is what gives a programmer his resources. It's an
         exchange system created by human beings.  It surrounds us.
         Works for us.  Binds the economy together.  Which reminds me.  Your
         father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but
         your Uncle wouldn't allow it.  He thought you'd follow old Obi-Wan
         on some damn idealistic crusade."
Luke:   "What is it?"
Ben:    "It's an object modeling tool.  The weapon of a systems
         programmer. Not as random or clumsy as a lexical parser.  An elegant
         compiler for a more civilized age."
