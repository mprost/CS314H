<PRE>
A local business was looking for office help.  They put a sign in
the window, stating the following:  "HELP WANTED.  Must be able to
type, must be good with a computer and must be bilingual.  We are an
Equal Opportunity Employer."

A short time afterwards, a dog trotted up to the window, saw the
sign and went inside.  He looked at the receptionist and wagged
his tail, then walked over to the sign, looked at it and whined.

Getting the idea, the receptionist got the office manager.  The
office manager looked at the dog and was surprised, to say the
least. However, the dog looked determined, so he lead him into the
office. Inside, the dog jumped up on the chair and stared at the
manager. The manager said "I can't hire you.  The sign says you have
to be able to type."  The dog jumped down, went to the typewriter and
proceeded to type out a perfect letter.  He took out the page and
trotted over to the manager and gave it to him, then jumped back on
the chair. The manager was stunned, but then told the dog "the sign
says you have to be good with a computer."

The dog jumped down again and went to the computer.  The dog
proceeded to enter and execute a perfect program, that worked
flawlessly the first time.  By this time the manager was totally
dumb-founded!

He looked at the dog and said "I realize that you are a very
intelligent dog and have some interesting abilities.  However, I
<b>still</b> can't give you the job."  The dog jumped down and went to a
copy of the sign and put his paw on the sentences that told about
being an Equal Opportunity Employer.  The manager said "yes, but the
sign <b>also</b> says that you have to be bilingual".

The dog looked at the manager calmly and said "Meow".
