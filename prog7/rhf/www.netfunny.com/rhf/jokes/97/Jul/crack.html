Those old college dreams not panning out? Are you stuck at a dead end job?
Well its not too late! You can change your life forever when you sell
CRACK!!

Look at all the benefits selling CRACK has over any other job out there:

--------------------------------------

Regular job
-----------
*Have to dress in constricting attire and wear a tie.

Selling CRACK
-------------
*Wear anything you want! Show up to work in a robe and bunny slippers...
nobody cares what a CRACK dealer wears!

--------------------------------------

Regular job
-----------
*Work your butt off for years to get small, token promotions. Hope you earn
enough to survive until the next paycheck.

Selling CRACK
-------------
*Earn more in a month than an brain surgeon makes in a year! You want that
red porche? Buy it now with CRACK CASH! You want a house with running
water? Buy it now with CRACK CASH!

--------------------------------------

Regular job
-----------
*Have to take verbal and emotional abuse from customers, clients,
co-workers, and supervisors in order to keep job.

Selling CRACK
-------------
*Someone look at you cross eyed? Don't like the color of someone's shirt?
Pull out your nine and chalk 'em! You can do that when you sell CRACK!

--------------------------------------

Regular job
-----------
*After years of toil, if you're lucky, you get a glimpse of the CEO at some
company get-together.

Selling CRACK
-------------
*Meet celebrities, models, and politicians from around the world! People
will beat a path to your door and ask for you by name! All because you sell
CRACK!

--------------------------------------

Regular job
-----------
* When its all said and done, a typing baboon could do your job and have
the same impact on the world.

Selling CRACK
-------------
*Influence popular culture and music! Movies will be made about your
lifestyle! Get congress' undivided attention with your daily actions!! All
because you sell CRACK!!!

--------------------------------------

Regular job
-----------
*Need to plan early for retirement. Hope and pray social security will last
a few more years.

Selling CRACK
-------------
*Retirement? You'll be lucky to live past 30 when you sell CRACK! (You
don't want to live past 30 anyway, right?)

--------------------------------------

When its all said and done, CRACK is where its at!!!

Just call 1-800-555-1234... We'll send you a complimentary packet of CRACK
absolutley free! There's no obligation!

That number again is 1-800-555-1234... operators are standing close by.
