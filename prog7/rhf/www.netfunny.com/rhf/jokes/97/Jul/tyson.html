Geez, looks like I chose the wrong weekend to attend a wedding...  What
follows are the better submissions regarding the Holyfield/Tyson fight
results.

From: rml@massmed.org (Bob Altshuler)

With Mills Lane stopping the fight after Tyson's second bite, the
following question remains unanswered:

Just how many bites does it take to get to the tootsie-roll center of
Evander Holyfield?

        =       =       =       =       =       =       =
From: nweaver@dusk.CS.Berkeley.EDU (Nicholas C. Weaver)

	Tyson doesn't get it.  He was supposed to get a taste of VICTORY
in this fight, not a taste of the victor.

        =       =       =       =       =       =       =

Good news! Don King has just announced that Mike Tyson will be ready to
fight again, as soon as he gets the okay from his dentist.

        =       =       =       =       =       =       =
From: cadams@iname.com (Clark Adams)

Evander Holyfield proved that he was sincere in his Christian
convictions - If a man biteth thy right ear, turn the other cheek and
offer him thy other also. (Matt 5:39)

        =       =       =       =       =       =       =
From: srbush@charybtech.com (Steve Bush)

Heard from a coworker:

I understand that Mike Tyson used to be a world ranked prize fighter.
Now, he's just a two bit boxer.

        =       =       =       =       =       =       =
From: wolk@ccm.UManitoba.CA (Barry Wolk)


Mike Tyson was disqualified because of a lobe blow.

" ... I just snapped." - Mike Tyson, Monday, June 30.

Yes, Mike, we know.  We all saw you snap on TV.  Like a
turtle.

        =       =       =       =       =       =       =
From:  (Mark Wiley)

I heard that Holyfield was trying to sue Tyson for trying to bite off his
ears, but the judge wouldn't give him a hearing.

        =       =       =       =       =       =       =

That's what Evander Holyfield deserves for taunting Mike Tyson:

"Hey Mike, you tough guy! C'mon, you want a piece of me?"
