</PRE>Hmm...let's see...you want to hear a story?  It has to do with a persistent 
rumor that my driving skills are somewhat lacking.  This story should put to 
rest all such idle gossip. 
<P>
Last Saturday morning, I needed to get coffee to lift that 
not-quite-awake-yet morning fog.  I shuffled into my car, drove down my 
street, and had to make a left onto a busy cross street.  I kept inching 
forward to see if there was a clearing in the traffic, when it occurred to me 
that I had drifted out too far.  I threw the car into reverse, hit the gas, 
and slammed into something.  I thought it was a signpost, and couldn't help 
imagining how silly I must have looked backing into a signpost.  The traffic 
cleared, I made the left and, looking back toward the area I had just left, 
saw a guy angrily getting out of his car to check his bumper.  It was only 
then that I realised that I had backed into the car behind me.  It simply 
never occurred to me to check my rearview mirror. 
<P>
The next morning I was at the same intersection.  The lady in front of me 
had also inched forward too far, and I saw her check her mirror, shift into 
reverse, and slowly backup.  I thought to myself "you see that, you see how 
she checked her mirror before backing up, she's an excellent driver, I should 
reward such an excellent driver by making room for her."  So I threw the car 
into reverse, hit the gas, and slammed into the car behind me.
