<PRE>This was fowarded to me by a friend...

Whenever I get a package of plain M&amp;Ms, I make it my duty to continue the
strength and robustness of the candy as a species.  To this end, I hold
M&amp;M duels.
Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure,
squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters.  That is
the "loser," and I eat the inferior one immediately.  The winner gets to go
another round.
I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&amp;Ms are tougher, and the
newer blue ones are genetically inferior.  I have hypothesized that the
blue M&amp;Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theatre of
competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world.
Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier,
or flatter than the rest.  Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness,
but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength.  In this way,
the species continues to adapt to its environment.
When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&amp;M, the strongest of
the herd.  Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it
neatly in an envelope and send it to M&amp;M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc.,
Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3x5 card reading, "Please
use this M&amp;M for breeding purposes."
This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2
pound bag of plain M&amp;Ms.  I consider this "grant money."  I have set aside
the weekend for a grand tournament.  From a field of hundreds, we will
discover the True Champion.

There can be only one.
