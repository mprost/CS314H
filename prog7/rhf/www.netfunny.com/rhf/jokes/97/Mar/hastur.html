This is original from me. It was originally an answer I wrote for the 
Internet Oracle - I've reworked it as a standalone.

<P>
&gt;To:  Microsoft Lawyers, Inc. 
&gt;From: Azathoth, Nyarlathotep and Hastur, Elder Attorneys. 
<P>
Sirs: 
<P>
Our agents among the mortal herd have brought to Our attention 
your recent product entitled Windows '95. Therefore We now give 
you statutory notice of intent of proceedings to be taken against 
Microsoft by the Many-Angled Ones. 
<P>
With this suit We will show that Windows '95, and to a lesser 
extent all of the Microsoft range of products, infringe upon the 
recognised "look-and-feel" of the Elder Gods, for the following 
reasons: 
<P>
o   Windows '95 is a crawling abomination from the darkest 
pits of Hell; 
<P>
o   No man can be in it's presence for too long without being 
driven into gibbering insanity; 
<P>
o   A cult who worship it exist in secret amongst the mortal 
herd; 
<P>
o   Those who associate with it for too long develop common 
physical characteristics, to wit: pale, clammy skin, bulging 
eyes, generally unkempt physical appearance, tendency 
towards nocturnal living, change in diet to that which normal 
men do not eat (in your case tacos, burgers and Jolt Coke; 
in Ours, human flesh, Fungi of Yuggoth and the blood of Alien 
Gods); 
<P>
o   Mysterious tomes that purport to explain this phenomenon are 
reputed to exist; they are bound in an unnatural substance 
and only available at a terrible cost to the user. 
<P>
o   The Microsoft range of products seek to utterly dominate 
the world, and force all who dwell there to live in eternal 
damnation. 
<P>
As you can see, Our case is very strong, especially when 
you consider that most judges prefer not to have chittering 
things with tentacles for faces scoop out their brains and 
eat them. 
<P>
We hope that you will consider these points carefully and settle 
out of court, since it is not Our intention to have your senior 
partners spend the rest of their mercifully short lives under 
heavy sedation in a maximum security psychiatric hospital. After 
all, it was the Lords of the Outer Planes who gave humanity 
lawyers in the first place. 
<P>
Respectfully yours, 
<P>
&lt;Oddly disturbing squiggle in some sort of ichor&gt; 
<P>
