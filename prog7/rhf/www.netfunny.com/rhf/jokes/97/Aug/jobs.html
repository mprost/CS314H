Reading the various job-related newsgroups while searching for employment
can be frustrating at times -- there are mis-posted articles, duplicate
articles, articles without relevant subject lines, get-rich-quick spams,
and a hundred other annoyances.

I can't help you with those.  However, I can help you to understand
the text of some of the less intelligible help-wanted articles.
Enclosed below are (1) direct quotes from articles which have
appeared in misc.jobs.offered with (2) a translation of what the
author actually meant to say.  The company and personal names have
been elided to protect my future job prospects, if any remain after
this gets posted.

This is not, repeat, not a position for an academic-type of internet hacker.
Rather, it is a need for a solid business applications developer type.

	"Even though we are trying to implement a cutting-edge
	web-based system, we are unaware that the academic community is
	precisely the place that such systems originated, and where a
	lot of the people who know how about them can be found. We
	would prefer to hire someone who still finds spreadsheets and
	accounting software exciting."
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to the volume of expected responses, we are only able to contact
candidates who qualify for this position.

	"Although sending an e-mail response to a received cover letter
	and resume would only a take a few seconds, we are too busy to

	enough to automate the process. Guess you'll never know if we
	received and read your resume..."

	who can either bail me out, or, by virtue of being the latest
	hire, take the blame."

Ability to carry pager and perform after-hours and weekend work required.
