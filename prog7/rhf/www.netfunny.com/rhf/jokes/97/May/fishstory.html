<PRE>
A lady goes into the local sporting goods store to buy a fishing rod
to give to her husband for his birthday.

A salesman wearing dark glasses with a dog is behind the counter and
asks, "Can I help you ma'am ?"

"Well, I'd like to buy a fishing rod, can you tell me about this one
?" she answers.

The salesman replies, "I'm sorry ma'am but I am blind and can not see
the rod your referring too. However, if you'll drop it on the counter
I'll tell you all about it as I can tell from the sound it makes."

The lady picks up the rod, and does what he says and drops it on the
counter.

He belts "That's a Zebco 2500, fiberglass, 6.5', medium action - $15."

Lady - "Wow !" She finds another and does the same.

"Thats an Orion 35C, graphite, 6', light action - best used with
ultralight tackle - $20."

Very impressed the lady decides to buy the second one.

As the man is ringing up the sale the lady rips a big fart but feels
no need to apologize as the salesman is blind and has no idea who she
is.

Salesman says, "That'll be $25."

"TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS !? YOU SAID $20.?"

"That's right ma'am, $20 for the rod, $3 for the duck call and $2 for
the fish bait."

Rather than explain the lady pays the $25.
