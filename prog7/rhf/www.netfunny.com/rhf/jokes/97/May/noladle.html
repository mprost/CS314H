This bishop invites a young priest over for dinner.  During the meal, 
the priest can't help noticing how attractive and shapely the 
housekeeper is.  Over the course of the evening he starts to wonder if 
there's more between the bishop and the housekeeper than meets the eye. 
Reading the young priest's thoughts, the bishop volunteers, "I know what 
you must be thinking, but I assure you, my relationship with my 
housekeeper is purely professional." 
<P>
About a week later the housekeeper comes to the bishop and says, 
"Excellency, ever since the young Father came to dinner, I've been 
unable to find the beautiful silver gravy ladle. You don't suppose he 
took it, do you?" 
<P>
The bishop says, "Well, I doubt it, but I'll write him a letter just to 
be sure."  So he sits down and writes: "Dear Father, I'm not saying that 
you 'did' take a gravy ladle from my house, and I'm not saying you 'did 
not' take a gravy ladle. But the fact remains that one has been missing 
ever since you were here for dinner." 
<P>
Several days later the bishop receives a letter from the young priest, 
which reads: "Your Excellency, I'm not saying that you 'do' sleep with 
your housekeeper, and I'm not saying that you 'do not' sleep with your 
housekeeper.  But the fact remains that if you were sleeping in your own 
bed, you would have found the gravy ladle by now."
