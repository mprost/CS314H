<PRE>To quote Dave Barry, "I am not making this up."  This is a real-life 
happening involving my mom, whom I will call "Wanda" to spare her any (more) 
embarrasment.  She and her new husband, "Ted", were in Jamaica on their 
honeymoon.  They were walking along the beach, and eventually came to a 
segment in which most of the patrons were nude.  

After they had left the area, Wanda asks Ted, "What were those little 
covers that a lot of the guys had over their penises?"  

Ted, after fighting back laughter,  informed her, "those men haven't been 
circumsized, dear."  

"Oh", she said, thoroughly embarrassed, "I though they were to keep them 
from getting sunburned."
