<PRE>In a tiny village lived an old maid. In spite of her old age, she was still a
virgin. She was very proud of it. She knew her last days were getting closer,
so she told the local undertaker that she wanted the following inscription on
her tombstone:

"Born as a virgin, lived as a virgin, died as a virgin"

Not long after, the old maid died peacefully, and the undertaker told his men
what the lady had said. The men went to carve it in, but as the lazy no-goods
they were, they thought the inscription to be unnecessarily long. They simply
wrote:

"Returned unopened"
