Physics Story

A true story.  A thermodynamics professor had written a take home exam 
for his graduate students.  It had one question:

"Is hell exothermic or endothermic?  Support your answer with a proof." 

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law 
or some variant.  One student, however wrote the following:

First, we postulate that if souls exist, then they must have some mass. 

If they do, then a mole of souls can also have a mass.  So, at what 
rate are souls moving into hell and at what rate are souls leaving?  I 
think that we  can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it 
will not leave.  Therefore, no souls are leaving.

As for souls entering hell, lets look at the different religions that 
exist   in the world today.  Some of these religions state that if you 
are not a member of their religion, you will go to hell.  Since, there 
are more than one of these religions and people do not belong to more 
than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to 
hell.

With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of 
souls in hell to increase exponentially.

Now, we look at the rate of change in volume in hell. Boyle's Law 
states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay 
the same, the ratio of the mass of souls and volume needs to stay 
constant.

So, if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls 
enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase 
until all hell breaks loose.

Of course, if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of 
souls in hell, than the temperature and pressure will drop until hell 
freezes over.

It was not revealed what grade the student got.
