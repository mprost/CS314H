<PRE>Found this on alt.disasters.aviation:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please pass this form to as many people as you know!!  The strike date is
Feb 15th.

We need to show the world just how they can help.

Help Feed AA Pilots
---- ---- -- ------

It's just not right.  Thousands of pilots in our very own country are
living at or just below the six figure salary line.  And if that wasn't bad 
enough, many of them may  go several weeks or months without a paycheck if 
they are forced by American Airlines management to strike.

But now you can help.  For about three hundred dollars a day ~ that's less
than the price of a 25" television set ~ you can help keep a pilot 
economically viable during their time of need.

Three hundred dollars a day may not seem like a lot of money to you,  but
to a pilot, it could mean the difference between a vacation fishing in 
Florida or a Mediteranean cruise.

For you, three hundred dollars is nothing more than half a month's rent or
mortgage payment.  But to a pilot, three hundred dollars a day will almost 
replace his or her salary. 

Three hundred dollars a day will enable a pilot to upgrade his or her home 
computer, buy that new 100" television set, trade in the
6 month old Lexus for a Ferrari, or enjoy a dinner (with champagne) at The
Mansion.

"HOW WILL I KNOW I"M HELPING?"
               
Each month, you will receive a complete               
financial report on the crew member you 
sponsor.  Detailed information about his 
or her stocks,bonds,401K, and real-estate
holdings will be mailed to your home.  You
will be able to watch your pilot's net worth
grow.  You'll also get information on how     
they chose to invest their 1.2 million dollar    
lump sum they get upon their retirement.

"HOW WIILL THEY KNOW I'M HELPING?"

Your pilot will be told that her or she has a
SPECIAL FRIEND that just wants to help.
Although the pilot won't know your name, he or
she will be able to make collect calls to your
home via a special operator in case they                                     
   need more funds.
