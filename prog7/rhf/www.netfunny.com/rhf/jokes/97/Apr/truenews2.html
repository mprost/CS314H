<PRE>What follows are the latest entries in the true news file.  These are jokes
which are funny, but which didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post
such a digest whenever I have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly
selective readers will probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to
killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in the title - ed.

I was watching the TV news in LA a few days ago. David Duke was scheduled
to participate in a debate at Cal State Northridge. This of course
sparked some protests. One intelligent protester proudly held a
placard that read:

&gt;To: packers@msn.fullfeed.com (Green Bay Packers Discussion List)

Heard this today on "Bob and Tom" radio show.

I can't remember the name of the town, but it's a small town in
Northern Wisconsin.  At 3:30 am, a passerby saw an intruder inside
a closed convienience store.  He then notified the police.
When they arrived, they looked through the window to see the figure
standing inside the darkened store. They stormed inside the store to
arrest the intruder.

The unarmed man was a lifesize cardboard cutout of Packers coach Mike
Holmgren.  He was unarmed at the time.

No charges were filed!

I just bought a cd of surf instrumentals, and had to laugh when I read the

It says "Enjoy the complete Rock Instrumental Classics Collection, available
on Rhino Records: (a list of instrumental cd's follows).  Below this it says
"For a complete set of lyrics, send $1.00 to Rhino Records."

Subject: You can't trust *anyone*!

Recently I attended the funeral of a friend. He was buried in a
lawn cemetery west of Sydney. As you drive around you pass small
signs which indicate where in the cemetery you are: "Garden of
Remembrance", "Vale of Tears" and so on. 

I wasn't quite sure what to think when I parked near this sign:

                 -------------------------
                 | "Garden of Innocence" |

Subject: turnabout is fair play

One day, I decided to reuse one of the available disks from the pool
of previously used disks at work.  On inserting it into the computer,
I found that the disk had belonged to someone that I didn't particularly
care for, so I erased the disk and renamed it "stupid".  Some time later,
I ejected the disk.  When I finally tried to shut the computer down, I
was greeted with the message "insert the disk stupid".  There's a lesson
there somewhere.

Subject: Student povery and prostitution

This morning I was listening to a report on BBC radio on student povery in
universities in East Anglia (roughly Norfolk, Suffolk, and parts of Essex
and Cambridgeshire). The reporter claimed that some female students were so
poor that they were turning to prostitution to make ends meet.

I suspect a deliberate mistake, but that is what the reporter said.

Not only did this really happen, but I suspect a high percentage of
rec.humor.funny readers saw it.

In the "Jeopardy" "Teen Tournament" on Friday Feb. 7, 1997, the last question
in the first round was to the effect  of "In Weddings, young boys called this
kind of 'Bearer' often carry a traditional item?"

The (then) leader replied, to the detriment of his score and the glee of
married men everywhere: "What are Pall Bearers?"

[Notes:  JSO = Jacksonville Sheriff's Office; JFR = Jacksonville Fire Rescue]

One morning, a local radio station reported that a truck carrying chickens
had overturned on the expressway in Jacksonville (Florida).  Chickens were
everywhere, and the driver was apparently injured.  According to the radio
deejay, "JSO, JFR, and KFC are responding."
