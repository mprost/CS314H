<PRE>What follows are the latest entries in the true news file.  These are jokes
which are funny, but which didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post
such a digest whenever I have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly
selective readers will probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to
killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in the title - ed.

Bruce Walker, nose tackle for the New England Patriots, recently received 5
stitches for a stab wound to his chest.  Apparently Walker was playing catch
with a steak knife in a super market parking lot with a friend ... and missed
the knife.

Walker is also the goaltender for the Patriots Dart Team.

Subject: How was your day today, honey?

Paraphrased from the Cincinnati Enquirer:
An armored car driver made a pickup from a branch of a Dayton credit
union, them made a pickup of a different source.  He told police he
solicited a prostitute.  After having sex in the back of the armored
car, she left.  Later, the driver noticed the $80,000 bag of money was
missing. No charges have been filed against the driver, but police are
looking for the (presumably retired) prostitute.

TRUE STORY


I was reading in some news magazine (I think TIME) about this college for 
the hearing-impaired.  The article dealt with the increasing 
number of reported rapes on that campus.

They were interviewing the president of the university, also deaf, and he 
was quoted in the magazine as saying:

"I haven't heard of any problems with rape on this campus"

Subject: Foiling Telemarketers


My uncle (60ish) has the most wonderful telephone manners, even with
telemarketers.  Once we were having dinner and the phone rang; he picked 
it up and, after a long time listening to some sales pitch, said sweetly:
"Sorry, my parents are not home". 

True, and effective, too.

	Dan Golder posted about the "Springfield Heights Institute of

part of local lore for years.  This is the real name of a women's college
in Baltimore, Maryland.  I used to drive by their entrance sign all the
time.

	College Of Notre Dame Of Maryland

And it was founded by nuns, I hear.

Subject: Finest error message ever

This is from this month's "Fast Forward", the Washington Posts' guide to 
electronic stuff.

In their review of the CD-ROM "Nixon" (which is about Oliver Stone's
movie, and some of the historical record it's "based" on), they find the
program VERY buggy, and so on the mac they're testing it on, it comes up 
with the error message:

	"Force 'Nixon' to quit?"
