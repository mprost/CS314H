<PRE>
The news that a sheep in Scotland has been successfully cloned got me
wondering.  What good would it be to clone humans?  What would I do with a
clone of myself?, for example.  Then it hit me.  I could have my clone go
into work for me while I went out hiking, biking, skiing, etc.!  I really
could be in two places at once. 

But wait a minute.  If that's what I would do with my clone, how do I know
that I'm not a clone myself?  What if the original me had himself cloned
and sent the clone (that is, me) in to do his work for him?  The original
me could be out there right now doing all those things I like to do: hiking
biking or skiing.

This explains a lot:

-all those mysterious checks I find in my bank statement every month (with
my signature) but don't remember writing,

-why my wife doesn't seem to notice when I've been out of town,

-why my wife thinks I get too much sex,

-all those traffic tickets I have to pay but swear I never received in 
the first place.

-why my friends say things like, "I thought I saw you out skiing last 
week," when I know I was at work, 

-why whenever I go out to get the mail and happen to see the carrier, she
gives me a knowing wink,

-why I keep getting fines for overdue books at the library, when I only 
check out CD's,

-the unexplained charges to my credit card (the one with my picture on
it) from London, Paris, New York... 

-the unexplained charges to that same card from motels where you pay by the 
hour,


I can only hope the original me never:

-gets sentenced to prison,

-enters a witness protection program,

-starts hitting on a loan shark's girl friend,

-or is named as the defendant in a paternity suit.
