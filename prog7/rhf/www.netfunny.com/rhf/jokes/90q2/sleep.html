<PRE>Many people today slide into addictive behavior without realizing it.  Only
objective evidence can persuade them that they indeed have a problem.  To 
help with one of today's most common problems, here's a short test you
can take.
	DO YOU HAVE A SLEEPING PROBLEM?
1. Have you ever experienced a loss of memory for events that happened
while you were sleeping?
2. Do you ever sleep before noon?
3. Have you ever felt remorse after sleeping?
4. Have you ever told yourself "I can get out of bed any time I want to?"
5. Do you get cranky and irritable after a few days without sleeping?
6. Have you ever spent time on sleeping that you had budgeted for other things?
7. Have you ever had a "short nap" turn into a major binge?
8. Do you ever sleep alone?
9. Do you associate with a lower class of people when you're sleeping?
10.Do you believe you can't have fun with your friends without 
sleeping with them?

If you answered "yes" to two or more questions then you may have a 
sleeping problem.  Let us help.  We care.  The next time you feel the
urge to take that first nap, we'll send over a trained volunteer to 
say "President Quayle" until you're wide awake.
