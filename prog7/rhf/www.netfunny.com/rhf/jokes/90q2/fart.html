<PRE>A son took his elderly father to a rest home, as the son could no longer
care adequately for him.. He said, "Pop, this is a very nice place where
you'll be properly cared for. I'll come by to check on you after work."

The nurse got the old man seated in a chair, and after a while, he leaned
over to his left. The nurse promptly sat him back straight up in the chair,
saying "Please sit straight.. We don't want you to fall out of the chair."

A while later, the old man leaned <i>way</i> over to his right, and the nurse
promptly sat him back up straight in the chair, repeating again "Please sit
straight.. We don't want you to fall out of the chair."

After work, when the son came by his father told him, "Please son, take
me out of here. This is a terrible place."

The son said, "But Pop, this place was highly recommended to me. What's the
matter with it?"

The old man replied, "They won't even let a guy fart in here!"
