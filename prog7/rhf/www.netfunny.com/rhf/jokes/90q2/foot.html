How to Determine Which Programming Language You're Using: 
<P>
The proliferation of modern programming languages which seem to have 
stolen countless features from each other sometimes makes it difficult to 
remember which language you're using.  This guide is offered as a public 
service to help programmers in such dilemmas. 
<P>
<!--  points-->
<DL>
<P>
<DT>C<DD> 
You shoot yourself in the foot. 
<P>
<DT>Assembly<DD> 
You crash the OS and overwrite the root disk.  The system 
administrator arrives and shoots you in the foot.  After 
a moment of contemplation, the administrator shoots himself 
in the foot and then hops around the room rabidly shooting 
at everyone in sight. 
<P>
<DT>C++<DD> 
You accidentally create a dozen instances of yourself and shoot 
them all in the foot.  Providing emergency medical care 
is impossible since you can't tell which are bitwise copies 
and which are just pointing at others and saying, "that's 
me, over there." 
<P>
<DT>Ada<DD> 
If you are dumb enough to actually use this language, the 
United States Department of Defense will kidnap you, 
stand you up in front of a firing squad, and tell the 
soldiers, "Shoot at his feet." 
<P>
<DT>Modula/2<DD> 
After realizing that you can't actually accomplish anything 
in the language, you shoot yourself in the head. 
<P>
<DT>sh, csh,etc.<DD> 
You can't remember the syntax for anything, so you spend five hours 
reading man pages before giving up.  You then shoot the computer 
and switch to C. 
<P>
<DT>Smalltalk<DD> 
You spend so much time playing with the graphics and windowing 
system that your boss shoots you in the foot, takes away your 
workstation, and makes you develop in COBOL on a character 
terminal. 
<P>
<DT>APL<DD> 
You hear a gunshot, and there's a hole in your foot, but you 
don't remember enough linear algebra to understand what the 
hell happened.
