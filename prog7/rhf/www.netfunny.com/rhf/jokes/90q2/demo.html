Remember, I just pass 'em on...  From: io!kopf!eisen (Carl West x4449) 
<P>
This came in from a friend who doesn't say where it's from: 
<P>
This fellow who had worked in advertising/marketing died and, upon 
entering heaven, met St. Peter.  St. Peter said, "In the interest 
of fairness, we want to give you the option to stay here in heaven, 
or to go to hell.  You can look around here for a few minutes, then 
go visit hell for a while before you decide.  The catch is that your 
decision is final--no changing your mind." 
<P>
So, the fellow started walking around heaven;  what he saw, he thought 
to be a bit boring.  People were playing horseshoes, bridge, drinking 
tea.  It wasn't bad, but it did look kind of slow.  He mentioned this 
to St. Peter, and asked for his visit to hell before his decision. 
<P>
Immediately, he found himself standing in front of two huge doors 
imprinted with "HELL."  Expecting the handle to be hot, he reached 
gingerly for it.  Surprisingly, the handle was cool to the touch. 
Proceeding through the doors, he found a flurry of activity.  People 
were standing around eating, drinking, dancing--in general having 
a great time.  The marketing fellow thought that this looked like 
much more fun than heaven, so he promptly returned to St. Peter and 
told him that he had chosen hell. 
<P>
Once again, he found himself in front of the huge doors.  Reaching 
to open the door, he scorched his hand on the blisteringly hot 
handle.  After entering, he was faced with a wall of flame, and he 
could hear horrendous screaming and moaning.  He stood there, 
incredulous.  The devil walked up and asked if there was some 
problem.  "Yes," the fellow replied, "I was just down here ten minutes 
ago, and it wasn't hot, and people were partying and having a great 
time!  What happened?" 
<P>
"Well," the devil replied, "that was a demo!!" 
<P>
