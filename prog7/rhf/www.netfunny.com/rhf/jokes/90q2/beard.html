<PRE>I first heard this about 12 years and 850 miles away.  No idea where it
originated.

Ma and Pa are out having a sit on the front porch one evening, smoking their
pipes and rocking in their rocking chairs.  Ma turns to Pa and says "Pa,
you got to do something about the outhouse".  Pa says "OK".

Next day, Pa goes out to the outhouse and knocks down the spider webs, puts
in fresh reading material and toilet paper and sweeps the floor.  

That evening, Ma and Pa are out rocking again.  Ma turns to Pa and says "Pa,
you still got to do something about the outhouse".  Pa says "OK".

Next day, Pa goes out and really does over the outhouse: new coat of paint,
oil on the door hinges, clean the windows; all that sort of thing.  "That
ought to do it", he says to himself.

That evening, Ma and Pa are out rocking again.  Ma turns to Pa and says "Pa,
you still got to do something about the outhouse".  Pa turns to Ma and says
"well, suppose you just show me what it is that needs doin'".

So Ma leads him out to the outhouse, opens the door and says "step on in".
Pa steps on in.  "Now, stick your head down through the hole".  Pa does so.
"Look to the left".  He does.  "Look to the right".  He does.  "Now pull your
head out".  As Pa pulls his head out, his beard snags on a nail under the seat.

"Yeow!" says Pa.

Ma says, "Annoying, ain't it?"
