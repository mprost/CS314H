This may be a repeat and I can't remember the source, but it goes like this: 
<P>
There was a wealthy Jew (non-Christian) who owned a nail company. 
His only son had just graduated from college and the father wanted to 
get him involved in the company. 
<P>
He initially farmed the young man out to each of the departments; 
first research &amp; development, then manufacturing, then sales, and in 
each the son was a dismal failure.  Determined to find a place for his 
offspring, the father decided that his son needed his own project. 
<P>
So the father placed his son in charge of the new advertising 
campaign.  He told him that he would have no supervision and that any 
and all resources which he needed would be placed at his disposal. 
The son was elated and immediately set off to make his father proud. 
<P>
Four weeks later the son proudly proclaimed, "I have finished!" and he 
and his father went out to examine the first product of the new 
campaign: a billboard. 
<P>
As they drove to the sight, the son explained how he had been blocked 
until a sudden insight had leaped into his head.  They turned the 
corner and to the father's horror the billboard portrayed Christ on 
a cross with the caption: "Even Then They Used Goldberg Nails." 
<P>
The father explained to the son that they couldn't portray Christ on a 
cross as it might offend their Christian clients.  Dejected, the son 
said that he would fix the problem and report back to his father. 
<P>
One week later the son again exclaimed that he was "finished," and 
took his father off to see the billboard.  Sure enough, Christ was no 
longer on the cross; he was lying at the base of the cross and the 
caption read: 
<P>
"This Wouldn't Happen With Goldberg Nails" 
<P>
