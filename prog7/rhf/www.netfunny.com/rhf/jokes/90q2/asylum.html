<PRE>Once, the leaders of the Soviet Union hoped they could
feed their people, if only they could get some help
from the West.  So they went to the West and arranged
to buy wheat.  That was not enough, since eventually,
the agreement ran out.

Then, the leaders of the Soviet Union hoped that if
they gave their people hope for freedom, they could
rebuild their economy and grow wheat themselves to
feed their people.  So they went to the West and
announced a new policy of openness.  That was not enough,
since the stores remained empty.

Now, the leaders of the Soviet Union are hoping that
if they give their people actual freedom, they will
rebuild the polity, rebuild the economy, and grow wheat
for themselves.  What will they ask for from the West?

Political asylum.
