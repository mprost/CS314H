<P>
PSUVM has been getting a bad rap lately because people don't 
understand it.  In an effort to enlighten the masses, I conducted 
this interview to correct any prejudices people may have. 
<P>
Mark&gt;  So let's get this interview started!  How did you come to learn VM? 
<P>
VMer&gt;  HEY!  THIS IS FUN!  I REALLY LIKE INTERVIEWS.  I HAVEN'T HAD THIS 
MUCH FUN SINCE I LEARNED HOW TO USE COBOL!  OH... ANYWAY, 
I FIRST CAME IN CONTACT WITH THIS GREAT OPERATING SYSTEM 
WHEN I TOOK CMPSCI 201, BACK THEN... 
<P>
Mark&gt;  Excuse me!  Could you turn all caps off?   Most people prefer to 
read mixed case. 
<P>
VMer&gt;  OH SURE!  HOW DO I DO THAT?  WHICH PFKEY? 
<P>
Mark&gt;  Here, I'll do it.  (I hit the caps-lock key and tear it off) 
<P>
VMer&gt;  Oh!  Ok!  If this is better for you. 
<P>
Mark&gt;  Yeah, much better.  So, I'm curious, what makes VM better than 
other systems? 
<P>
VMer&gt;  Well, it would have to be its speed!  Yeah, everything takes just 
a couple of seconds to run... 
<P>
Mark&gt;  But doesn't Cray and MIPS make systems faster than a 3090? 
<P>
VMer&gt;  Well, er, yeah.  But they can't run as many users as VM can! 
<P>
Mark&gt;  Wait a minute, why not just link a couple of Crays or Mips up 
together and accomplish the same thing, it might be cheaper... 
<P>
VMer&gt;  Well, I guess you can do that.  But they still won't ALL be on 
the same system! 
<P>
Mark&gt;  Well, we can sort of make it one system if you know what I mean. 
We could just have a single system name for people to log 
into that would handle incoming users and delegate them 
to the least overloaded processor.  That's what VM does anyway. 
<P>
VMer&gt;  You don't understand VM, buster!  It's not providing service 
for all those people that's important!  It's <B>squeezing</B> them 
all onto the fewest number of processors you can!  That's 
<B>all</B> that matters! 
<P>
Mark&gt;  Ok.  I think I understand now.  So what are you up to? 
<P>
VMer&gt;  I'm using Xedit to make a super review of phone systems... I'm going 
to put it in psu.students. 
<P>
Mark&gt;  That's great!  What's your method of review? 
<P>
VMer&gt;  How many phones can you hook into a <B>single</B> line before it burns out. 
That's the most important criterion, you know.  Also, a PFkey for every 
person you want to call. At least 50 on every home phone.  50,000 of them 
on every pay phone.  Using personal phone numbers is such a pain! 
<P>
Mark&gt;  I'm sure it is!  Thank you. 
<P>
VMer&gt;  (Jamming the Caps-Lock back into place.)  YOU'RE WELCOME!  COME BACK 
WHEN YOU WANT TO USE A REAL, MODERN SYSTEM! 
<P>
