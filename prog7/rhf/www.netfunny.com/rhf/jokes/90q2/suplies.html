Well, I tried mailing this twice, but to no avail. It bounced. So I guess
I'lll just have to try posting it and hope it gets there...

          These three guys -  an  American,  Chinese,  and  German  -  were
     shipwrecked  on  a desert island. The German found this smokey bottle.
     So he brought it back to the other two and they all opened it  togther
     (the  German  was  a  really  nice guy). Well, low and behold, a GENIE
     POPPED OUT! The genie granted them each one wish, and  of  course  all
     three  wanted  to  be back home. So the genie said he would grant them
     their wishes.

          "But first, you must all do me a favor. Mr. American - I want you
     to  built me a restaurant here. Mr. German - you will make the kitchen
     for this restaurant. Mr. Chinaman - you will get the supplies for  the
     restaurant.  I  have a hot date waiting for me in Bagdad, so I have to
     go. But I will return in ONE MONTH. At that time, if you satisfied  my
     requirements, I will grant your wishes."

          So for one month, the three men American and German toiled  while
     the  Oriental  kinda lazed around and gave a helping hand to the other
     two. Then about 4 days before the genie's expected return, the  Orien-
     tal disappeared.

          Well, the genie came back, just as he promised, and asked  to  be
     shown what they had done.

          He was amazed by the restaurant! Five dining rooms, a  tremendous
     main lobby - all made of bamboo! It was a magnificent feat. As for the
     kitchen - full utensils, running gas stoves, pots,  pans  -  all  made
     from shells, bamboo, and coconuts. An absolute wonder!

          "But where are the supplies from Mr. Chinaman?"

          The two men said they didn't know. All they knew was that he  had
     disappered  a  few  days ago and they hadn't seen hide nor hair of him
     since then. Suddenly from the shadows, out leaped the Oriental, shout-
     ing in a loud voice:

                               "SUPLISE!!!!!!!!!"
