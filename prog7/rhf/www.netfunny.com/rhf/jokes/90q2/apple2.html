<STRONG>[Ed: Well, what can I say.  This piece is long and rather nasty to Apple, but 
it has its good moments.  If you're from Apple, don't read it.]</STRONG> 
<P>
Ever watch a TV show and someone'll say: 
<P>
"Take this, you son-of-a-[BEEP]!!"? 
<P>
And you, of course, fill in the missing word. 
<P>
"Son-of-a-Bitch," you say in your mind. 
<P>
And so does every human being who hears the beep, because the mind 
naturally completes recognized patterns, no matter how fragmented they 
are. We know that "bitch" follows "son of a" just like night follows 
day or Pete Rose follows bookies.  Unless of course you're Russian. 
Then, "son of" is usually followed by "Ivan" or "Mikhail" or somesuch 
male Russian name that reminds you of various blackspots on the 
otherwise clean and white tapestry of Russian history. 
<P>
But anyways, I was talking about how censors cover-up swear words 
with bleeps and stupid sound effects. The whole reason they go through 
all this bullshit and cut up decent movies into nonsequential nonsense 
is so our children won't hear words usually only associated with the 
description of Apple products. 
<P>
Now, I don't wanna get on anyone's case about this, but I am wholly 
amazed by Apple's IIGS system. This is the most mazing case of reverse 
technology in computer history! In the age of the 386/33 and the 
486/25, Apple Computer comes out with a machine that runs at an 
astounding 2 mHz!  AND, you can speed it up to a blinding 2.5 mHz. 
HOLY SHIT! Two point five?  You know how they play THAT one off? The 
salespeople tell ya "Yeah, and the high-speed mode speeds up the CPU 
25 PERCENT!" What the HELL is this?!  Did some dude at Apple get Woz 
really plastered and then say: 
<P>
"Hey Steve! I'll tell ya what--if we can't beat 'em at making 
the fastest machine, by God--we'll beat 'em at making the SLOWEST!"? 
<P>
Because they DID! 
<P>
This thing's like a slug in winter! And as if this Yugo CPU wasn't bad 
enough, they get a disk drive straight out of computer Hell! You ever load a 
program on a Commodore 64? I mean waiting 20 minutes for Zork to load might 
have seemed like a long time then, but you load Zork on a IIGS, and boy, you 
are in for a WAIT! Your grandkids'll be sittin' there waitin' for that 
fucker to load. I'm not joking! If you have a monitoring program, you can 
see the drive plinking off bits in a completely leisurely manner. Plodding 
doesn't even BEGIN to describe it!  Plodding suggests MOVEMENT, and if you 
can master the almost Zen Buddhist-like art of sitting still in front of a 
II GS drive long enough to detect the motion of the disk, then you've got a 
pretty good idea of what taking THORAZINE is like! If you can sit still that 
long, you're qualified to be a National Monument! 
<P>
And when you pay for it, it's like you bought a C-64, BUT AT AN 
IBM PRICE! A good (and that's a word not commonly used in conjuncture 
with "GS") system will put you back close to $3,000! You can get a 
decent (there's another one of those aforementioned words) 286 system 
for that!  And a 286/12 kicks this thing's ass so many ways you can't 
count 'em!  (at least not on a GS). 
<P>
They call it "GS," but they don't tell you it stands for "Goddamn SLOW"! 
<P>
Oh, it's got great graphics. Serious, this thing's got the 
graphics.  But it's like having unlimited credit at a Goodwill shop! 
You'll also wait MONTHS before their demo picture of the golden King 
Tut finally gets to the screen. The whole time, at wholly random 
intervals, you'll get messages like: 
<P>
"Now computing byte 53, bit 6, of 648,457 bytes. Next report in 20 mins." 
<P>
And just about the time you've gotten the .12 gauge outta the 
closet with the computracide on your mind, the little fucker'll pop up 
some Fable ROM program imbedded in its enfeebled memory and tell you a 
little a story like: 
<P>
"Once upon a time, there was a sloth and a cheetah. The cheetah 
was a very fast cat and the sloth a plodding oaf. Too many times was 
the cheetah caught speeding by the CHP (oh hey, for those of you who 
have the unfortunate fate of living outside California, CHP means 
California Highway Patrol) and the CHP sawed the poor cheetah's legs 
off. 
<P>
"Moral: People who buy fast machines often get their legs sawn off." 
<P>
You stand there, looking dumbfounded. 
<P>
"What?" you ask yourself. 
<P>
And the GS answers: 
<P>
"Now computing byte 53, bit 7, of 648,457 bytes. Next report in 20mins." 
<P>
You'll blast that son of a    (y'all said 'bitch', dinja? See?...) 
straight to computer Hell where some poor bastard'll hafta wait for it to 
compute PI to 20 billion digits (NOW you know why you need PI calculated 20 
billion digits!) before he can go to Heaven! 
<P>
THIS THING IS A TURD! It's a cattle-dropping of a computer! The 
day Apple introduced this li'l gem was forever to be known as "The Day 
Silicon Valley Smelled like BULLSHIT" because if you call a turd "a 
rose," IT'S STILL A TURD! I don't care what PR says! If it's brown and 
smells like shit, IT'S PROBABLY A TURD! 
<P>
You want to have some fun with an Apple Dealer? Get dressed in 
your best business suit and walk into AppleLand or any store that only 
sells Apple and go up to a dealer. Look for the slimiest one. Tell him 
you've been thinking about getting a II GS for your family for months 
and have finally decided to buy the best II GS system available. Now 
if you could only see a demo, you would be convinced that you were 
spending your money wisely.  They'll put on the dog and pony show for 
ya and show you some cute program. 
<P>
Then tell the dealer you use "Harvard Graphics" a lot at work (or 
any other HUGE program they have II GS versions of) and seeing how it 
looks on the II GS would close the deal. And the whole time, talk 
about hard drives, expensive monitors, and lots of software. But don't 
over-do it or they'll figure you out. 
<P>
But anyway, when he plops in the full 1.8 meg floppy to be read 
at 300 baud by the disk drive, you start a conversation, and casually 
introduce how speed in a computer is important to you. Mention the 
fact that you work with a 386/33 at your office and tell him that the 
baby really flies!  Keep talking about how impressed you are with the 
22 millisecond access time on a Compaq 110 megabyte hard drive. Tell 
'em how you load MS Windows in 3 seconds. 2 seconds for Harvard 
Graphics.  Then, VERY casually look at the II GS drive, then look at 
your watch.  Frown.  Do it again with a very slight look of disbelief. 
Ask, "Is it done yet?" quizzically . . . 
<P>
Watch the little weasel SWEAT! 
<P>
Oh, it will do you a WORLD of good! 
<P>
Caution! If you start busting up now, it's OVER! You won't EVEN 
stop! But if he recovers and gets the conversation going again, just 
look over towards the drive every so often and sound slightly more 
irritated each time you reply to the dealer. THEN: Look at the drive 
and then at your watch again.  Look the dealer right in the eye and 
ask, "Is it done loading yet?" with a little more irritation. 
<P>
Just see how many times you can repeat the cycle. When the Dealer 
starts getting really pissed about being asked "Is it done loading 
yet?" a million times and gets rude, or the program actually loads, 
you close the deal. But then look at the computer, then at your watch 
and tell him "I need to reconsider this.  I'll come by again if I 
decide to stay with this machine." Look at the machine and shake your 
head while saying "But it's doubtful," and walk out. 
<P>
You will have fucked that guy's day! 
<P>
If you wanna really dangle the dude on the hook, get him to admit 
Compaq is superior to Apple. Just mention the 386/33 in your "office" 
again and then ask: 
<P>
"What does this machine run at? 10 megahertz? 8?" 
<P>
"2" the Dealer will admit. 
<P>
Look him right in the eye and ask in the your most astounded voice: 
<P>
"2?" 
<P>
The dealer will shrivel up like a snail with salt poured on it! 
<P>
If you have enough Apple-only dealers in your town, you and a friend 
can make an afternoon of it! And every time you walk out of one of those 
places, after rightfully humbling those toadies, you feel at one with 
nature, and animals will cross the street to be near you. 
<P>
Heh heh heh. 
<P>
I'm sorry, before I got off on all the Apple stuff, (by the way, 
I don't want everyone thinking I hate Apple computers. That was just a 
little good-natured prod to remind the folks at Apple which half of 
the 80's we are in.) I wuz talkin' about censoring TV programs for 
the sake of our childrens' language.  Okay, do this: 
<P>
Tonight when you go home, walk up to your kid and ask him/her to 
complete this sentence: 
<P>
"Mike Tyson is one bad mother  ." 
<P>
Your kid'll look you straight in the eye and say: 
<P>
"Fuhka." 
<P>
This is the exact and true nature of what censoring TV movies 
accomplishes. 
<P>
