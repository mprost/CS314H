Status of this Memo 
<P>
This memo describes an experimental method for the encapsulation of 
IP datagrams in avian carriers.  This specification is primarily 
useful in Metropolitan Area Networks.  This is an experimental, not 
recommended standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited. 
<P>
Overview and Rational 
<P>
Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low 
altitude service.  The connection topology is limited to a single 
point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers, 
but many carriers can be used without significant interference with 
each other, outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D ether 
space available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by 
IEEE802.3.  The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance 
system, which increases availability.  Unlike some network 
technologies, such as packet radio, communication is not limited to 
line-of-sight distance.  Connection oriented service is available in 
some cities, usually based upon a central hub topology. 
<P>
Frame Format 
<P>
The IP datagram is printed, on a small scroll of paper, in 
hexadecimal, with each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff. 
The scroll of paper is wrapped around one leg of the avian carrier. 
A band of duct tape is used to secure the datagram's edges.  The 
bandwidth is limited to the leg length.  The MTU is variable, and 
paradoxically, generally increases with increased carrier age.  A 
typical MTU is 256 milligrams.  Some datagram padding may be needed. 
<P>
Upon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper copy of the 
datagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittable 
form. 
<P>
Discussion 
<P>
Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized pecking 
order.  An additional property is built-in worm detection and 
eradication.  Because IP only guarantees best effort delivery, loss 
of a carrier can be tolerated.  With time, the carriers are self- 
regenerating.  While broadcasting is not specified, storms can cause 
data loss.  There is persistent delivery retry, until the carrier 
drops.  Audit trails are automatically generated, and can often be 
found on logs and cable trays. 
<P>
Security Considerations 
<P>
Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special 
measures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers 
are used in a tactical environment.
