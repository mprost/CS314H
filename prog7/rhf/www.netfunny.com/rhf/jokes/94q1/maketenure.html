Dear Fellow Scientist: 
<P>
This letter has been around the world at least seven times.  It has been 
to many major conferences.  Now it has come to you.  It will bring you 
good fortune.  This is true even if you don't believe it.  But you must 
follow these instructions: 
<P>
<!--  bullets-->
<UL><LI>include in your next journal article the citations below. 
<LI>remove the first citation from the list and add a 
citation to your journal article at the bottom. 
<LI>make ten copies and send them to colleagues. 
</UL>
<P>
Within one year, you will be cited up to 10,000 times!  This will 
amaze your fellow faculty, assure your promotion and improve 
your sex life.  In addition, you will bring joy to many colleagues. 
Do not break the reference loop, but send this letter on today. 
<P>
Dr. H. received this letter and within a year after passing it on she 
was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.  Prof. M.  threw this 
letter away and was denied tenure.  In Japan, Dr.  I. received this 
letter and put it aside.  His article for Trans. on Nephrology was 
rejected.  He found the letter and passed it on, and his article was 
published that year in the New England Journal of Medicine.  In the 
Midwest, Prof. K. failed to pass on the letter, and in a budget cutback 
his entire department was eliminated.  This could happen to you if you 
break the chain of citations.
