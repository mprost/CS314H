<PRE>This was sent to soc.culture.china by an anonymous poster:

&gt;   GO (A Chinese and Japanese board game) is a lousy game. It is boring and 
&gt; exhausting. All pieces (stones) are identical, showing oriental culture
&gt; does not tolerate individuality. The result is either win or lose and
&gt; there is no draw, indicating oriental culture does not advocate compromise. 
&gt; No physical representation is assigned to any piece, implying oriental people
&gt; have no personality.
&gt;   Yeh, there is a Chinese chess. But that was brought from India and Chinese
&gt; made some changes into it. A pawn can not be promoted and Queen is missing
&gt; from action. Chinese do not respect small-time nobody and discriminate against
&gt; women. They count cannon in as a chessman because they love more violence.
&gt; They replace bishop with prime minister because they believe in power than
&gt; free thinking. Finally they create two guards for their general or marshall 
&gt; since they are more scared and they are real "paper tigers".
&gt;   (There is no King in Chinese chess, the purpose of the game is to catch  
&gt; the general or the marshall) 

and here is my reply:

&gt;   Chess, an Occidental bored;-) game is a lousy game. It's too simple
&gt; and doesn't need to much brain. Different pieces are given different
&gt; power and ability, showing the Anglo passion for class. Unlike the Go,
&gt; as the game progresses, pieces are killed and less pieces are left
&gt; than the opening of the game, implying the Occidental culture's
&gt; preference for destruction. Whereas in Go, more pieces exist than the
&gt; opening, and all pieces eventually coexist in an integrated way,
&gt; showing that Oriental culture prefers peace and harmony. Besides, the
&gt; black square bishop can not move into white squares indicating the
&gt; Occidentals have always been promoting aparthied.  However, there is
&gt; something good about Chess, the king has to depend on his wife for
&gt; strength, a justification for the Americans' choice of Bill Clinton
&gt; as their president.
