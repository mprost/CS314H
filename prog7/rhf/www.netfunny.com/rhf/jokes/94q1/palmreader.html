[ This is indeed an original told to me by a friend (I think ;-) ]

A guy who has nothing to do all day except play with himself, gets very
down and hard on his luck so he finally decides to consult a palmist
regarding his future -

He meets the palmist and asks him about job possiblities, marriage prospects
etc. The palmist takes one good look at his hands and orders him to strip
from the waist down. He then tells him that everything will fall into
place within six months...that he'll find a great high paying job and
also get a gorgeous wife.

After six months, he goes back to the palmist all happy and glowing because
all the predictions have come true. but one essential question remains:

He asks respectfully," If you don't mind, will you please tell me why did
you tell me to strip on that day?"

The palmist replies " Well! that's easy enough; you've used your hand so much
that all the lines got imprinted down there!!!
