Kittens, better than babies? Hah! Here now are the top ELEVEN reasons why 
babies are better than kittens (and, as any five-year-old will tell you, more 
reasons makes my list better. Nyah! Nyah! Nyah!) 
<P>
11) Babies are rarely known to shed on furniture. 
<P>
10) No one's allergic to a baby. 
<P>
9) Having a kitten in the car doesn't let you drive in the carpool lane. 
<P>
8) An exercise program you can really stick with... that you HAVE to stick 
with, whether you like it or not... 
<P>
7) With a kitten, you don't get to watch otherwise normal adults making 
silly faces, jumping up and down, talking nonsense in a high pitched voice, 
and generally making fools of themselves. Hours of fun! 
<P>
6) For an initial investment of a camera and few pieces of film, you can 
convince baby's grandparents to buy the kid all the cute but expensive 
clothes, toys, furniture, and major appliances s/he will ever need--a good 
photographer can buy nothing but diapers for a year. Cats never buy their 
grandkittens anything. 
<P>
5) Babies don't have fleas. Babies don't give YOU fleas. 
<P>
4) Free pregnancy/labor horror story with each baby. Commensurate with other 
mothers! Scare newly-pregnant friends! Get your husband to do twice the 
housework for months! 
<P>
3) Two words: Tax deduction 
<P>
2) Childbirth--the greatest crash diet ever! Lose 20 pounds in one day-- 
and keep it off, too! 
<P>
And the number one reason babies are better than kittens: 
<P>
1) Kittens never grow up to look at you and say "I love you, Daddy." 
<P>
