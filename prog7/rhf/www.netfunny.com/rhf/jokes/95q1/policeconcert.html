<PRE>Man, I was toolin' around last night, and got to see this great concert!

I wasn't even plannin' on it...

They got this new thing now--portable concerts!  They spot you in traffic
and play for ya!  It's pretty rad.  I was zippin' along the freeway, and
I see this thing that looks sorta like a light show, but on wheels.  And
it's blasting the rad guitar solo!  WooWooWoo!  Wwawawawawa! Whoop! Whoop!
And the guy kept with me all through traffic!  It was pretty cool!  Only
thing was after awhile, it got kinda dull--seems they only knew like three
or four guitar riffs.  Oh well.  I looked at the car to see what group it
was.  I think it was the Police.  From what I saw it was their "Highway
Patrol" tour.  Rad, huh?

Anyhow, I decided to see if I could get their signatures.  Guess what?
The dude comes right up to the car, and asks for mine too!  I'm like,
"Dude--Rad concert!"  He was all modest, claiming it wasn't anything like
that.  The dude's too cool.   And the best part of all--I didn't have
to pay for my ticket till afterwards.

I'm gonna see if they're playing again tonight.
