REDMOND, Washington--January 4, 1995--In response to customer 
inquiries, Microsoft today clarified the naming policy for Bob(tm), its 
new software product designed for computer beginners.  Contrary to 
rumors, Microsoft will not demand that all persons formerly named "Bob" 
immediately select new first names. 
<P>
"I don't know where these rumors come from," commented Steve 
Balmer, Microsoft Executive Vice President for Worldwide Sales and 
Support.  "It's ridiculous to think Microsoft would force people 
outside the computer industry to change their names.  We won't, and our 
licensing policies for people within the industry will be so reasonable 
that the Justice Department could never question them." 
<P>
Balmer said employees of other computer companies will be given the 
opportunity to select new names, and will also be offered a licensing 
option allowing them to continue using their former names at very low 
cost. 
<P>
The new licensing program, called Microsoft TrueName(tm), offers 
persons who want to continue being known by the name Bob the option 
of doing so, with the payment of a small monthly licensing fee and upon 
signing a release form promising never to use OpenDoc.  As an added 
bonus, Bob name licensees will also be authorized to display the 
Windows 95 logo on their bodies. 
<P>
Persons choosing not to license the Bob name will be given a 60-day 
grace period during which they can select another related name. 
"We're being very lenient in our enforcement of the Bob trademark," 
said Bill Newkom, Microsoft's Senior Vice President of Law and 
Corporate Affairs.  "People are still free to call themselves Robert, 
Robby, or even Rob.  Bobby however is derivative of Microsoft's 
trademark and obviously can't be allowed." 
<P>
Microsoft also announced today that Bob(tm) Harbold, its Executive 
Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, has become the first 
Microsoft TrueName licensee and will have the Windows 95 logo tattooed 
to his forehead.
