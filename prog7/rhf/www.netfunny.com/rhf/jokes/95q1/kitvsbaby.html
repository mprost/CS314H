I've known a number of people who told  me that  they were really 
eager to have babies.  Having  a spouse or  good job would be ok, too, 
but what they  were really after was the babies.   I never  understood 
the attraction  for a long time, but then  it hit me.  They must  want 
babies like I  wanted a cat.  (Until recently I lived  in a dormitory, 
where  people  of  the  furry  persuasion are the subject  of  intense 
discrimination.) Though I now  understand  the feelings  of those  who 
have  the  unfulfilled  cravings of the  existence  of  another living 
creature in  the house, I feel  it my duty to  point out the flaws  in 
their reasoning. 
<P>
Top 10 reasons why kittens are better than babies: 
<P>
10.  Veterinarians have evening hours. 
<P>
9.   Your kitten won't be able to disturb the whole movie theater with its 
crying.  Hell, you don't even have to take the kitten with you, and if 
you don't, you don't even't have to worry about whether or not the 
sitter is available tonight. 
<P>
8.   Your kitten won't grow out of those cute but expensive clothes 
within three months. 
<P>
7.   Kittens look cute if they haven't had a bath this month. 
<P>
6.   You probably don't have to lie awake nights wondering how you are 
going to finance your kitten's college (or high school) education. 
<P>
5.   No one will accuse you of being an unfit mother if you don't want 
to breast feed your kitten. 
<P>
4.   No one will accuse you of perversion or sexual abuse if you fondle 
your kitten. 
<P>
3.   Dan Quayle can't accuse you of destroying the moral fabric of the 
country if you aren't married to the father of your kitten.  In fact, 
nobody will ever ask you if you know who the father is. 
<P>
2.   No one will question your abilities to function normally at your 
job when they hear you just got a kitten. 
<P>
And the Number 1 reason: 
<P>
1.   You only have to change a litter box once a day. 
<P>
