<PRE>
I don't know if these are true or not but just heard these jokes floating
around in the company, about the big-wig corporate people who wear ties 
to work, everyday, in order to reduce blood supply to their brains. 
Because reducing blood supply to the brains has been shown to help them 
make better decisions.

Here's the joke:

Because of a recent news about a financial scam in the company the
stock price dropped from $14 to $7 in one day but rose back to
$10.50 the following week. Since decreases and increases in stock prices 
are usually mentioned in percentage, the CEO was heard making some 
comment like: 
Usually stock Markets react to such news in panic, hence the price dropped by 
50% the first day but within a week it rose 50% so we are back to where we 
were.


Here's another one:

We recently hired a foreign graduate with a PhD in Maths. His degree
certificate had it printed in bold DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY.  When the
hiring manager went to the high flying company immigration lawyer regarding 
his visa, the lawyer got mad at the hiring manager saying that how the
hell can he justify, to the labor department, hiring a Philosophy major 
for a state-of-the-art high-tech software development job.
