Heard on Steve Wright In The Morning on Radio One FM (97-99 across the UK)
on 7th July 1994.

"The Newsagent" is an indescribable character who drops into the studio 
twice a morning, supposedly to deliver the newspapers and magazines.  On 
this occasion he said that business was getting slack so he went for an 
interview for a job as a sales rep.

The interview went quite well, he said, but the trouble was he kept
winking. 

The interviewer said "Although you have a lot of the qualities we're
looking for, the fact that you keep winking could put a lot of our
potential customers off." 

"Oh, that's no problem," said the newsagent.  "I stop winking if I take a
couple of aspirin." 

"Show me," said the interviewer.

So the newsagent reached into his pocket.  Embarrassingly he pulled out 
loads of condoms of every variety - ribbed, flavoured, coloured and 
everything before he found the packet of aspirin.  He took the aspirin 
and soon stopped winking.

The interviewer said, "I don't think we could employ someone who'd be 
womanising all over the territory."

"Ex-cUse me!" exclaimed the newsagent, "I'm a happily married man, not a
womaniser!" 

"Well how do you explain all the condoms, then," asked the interviewer.

The newsagent replied, "Have YOU ever gone into a chemist's, winking, and
asked for a packet of aspirin?" 


{UK to US conversion: coloured = colored, chemist's = drug store}
