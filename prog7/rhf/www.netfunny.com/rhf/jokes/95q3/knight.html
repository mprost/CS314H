   The following is a variation on a theme of a classic joke, but an original
variation.  It being college hoops time, and Coach Knight being up to his
standard antics, I thought I'd give this a go.

   Robert Knight, after his team had been sent home from the tournament, began
considering his career, his future, and, as his thoughts turned that direction,
the afterlife.  So he contacted his local minister to discuss the issue.
   "Reverend, will I be able to coach basketball in Heaven?", he inquired.
   Now, of course, his minister didn't want to give a glib answer, so he told
Bobby that he wanted to pray for a while and ask for some divine inspiration
before responding to his question.
   After a week of prayer, the minister called the coach into his study, and
asked him to take a seat.
   "Robert," he said, "I have some good news for you, and some bad news."
   "What's the good news?", asked Coach Knight.
   "Well, the good news is that yes, you will be able to coach basketball in
Heaven," replied the minister.
   "And the bad news?" asked coach Knight (grimacing, probably having heard
jokes like this before).
   "Well, Bob," responded the minister, "you'll be coaching the visiting team."
