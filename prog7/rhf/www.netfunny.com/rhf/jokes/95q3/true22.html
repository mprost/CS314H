Subject: Social Commentary

	We were very busy last week. My wife was preparing for a book-signing
and library convention, I was building the displays, and we were pulling 
together all of the paperwork for the annual income tax battle. As a result, 
the home office was full of boxes and stacks of paper -- promo flyers, books,
business receipts, and tax forms.

	In the middle of all the confusion, no one had let the dog out. He
walked into the office, sniffed at the boxes, then raised his leg for a 
direct hit on the completed tax forms. At that point I was torn. Should I 
whack him with a paper and yell at him, or should I just tell him to move 
over and give me a chance at them? In any event, if we are selected for an 
audit, it should be entertaining.

    A few days before Christmas my car broke down while I was driving on
a long trip to my parents' house.  The shaft that supports the valve
rockers was broken.  I was in a hurry to get my car repaired so I could
get home by Christmas, but none of the repairmen or dealers in town had
the correct replacement shaft in stock.  One dealer had a used engine
and offered to use that engine's rocker shaft to replace the broken one.
 He wasn't going to charge me for the used part, but the labor was going
to cost alot.  His exact words were:

  " 'Tis the Season, so we'll give you the shaft for free "

The health insurance company that I'm working with has a closet near the 
lunchroom to store bottled water.  Mounted on the wall of this closet is a 
sledgehammer, a crowbar, and an axe.  This does not bother me.

What worries me is that someone felt they needed to post a sign indicating 
that they are "For Emergency Use Only."

Raymond Cuthbert walked into Nolan's Pharmacy in Vernon, BC, on
Thursday evening and boasted that he was returning in half an hour to
rob them.

True enough, about 30 minutes later, he returned with Robert Phimister
carrying a concealed hunting knife... into the waiting hands of the
Mounties! whom the drug store employees had called after his boast.

Mountie Hugh Menzies said, "I don't know why he did it; he's well known
to the local police."

Went to my local BookStop yesterday to see if Skeptical Inquirer
was out yet.  Next to it were all kinds of weenie New Age/Alternative
Religion magazines, one of which apparently had an article on romance
and palmistry (for Valentine's Day, no doubt).  The headline on the
front of the mag was:

   "Find Love in Your Palm."

I didn't look to see if the author was Joycelyn Elders.

Our local Toys-backwards-R-Us is doing some renovations, and, for the first
couple of days had the following signs stuck up all over the place (spacing
of words and lines is as they had it):

                ATTENTION   ALL
                CUSTOMERS,   WE

                THE RENOVATIONS
                IN  THE  STORE.
                
Somebody obviously noticed the problem in the wording and replaced the signs
with ones saying INVCONVENIENCE.  However, they missed replacing the sign at
their exit.

I used to be proud of the Albuquerque Journal (our local paper here) for 
their willingness to document the Internet in their weekly access 
section. This quote taken direct from Access, 13 June 95:
[on privacy, specifically PGP]
"If you are going to exchange a credit card number or confidential 
information, you can encrypt your own e-mail messages with the freeware 
program Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) which can be downloaded from several 
sites on the Net. You can get a copy through ftp at cecilia.media.mit.edu 
in location:/pub, file -rw-r--r--."

Guess they're used to DOS directory listings.

High in the Rockies, in a town so small that the main road
isn't paved, there's a sign on that road that reads:
