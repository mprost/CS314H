<PRE>
A young man goes into a drug store to buy condoms.  The pharmacist 
says the condoms come in packs of 3, 9 or 12 and asks which the young 
man wants.  "Well," he said, "I've been seeing this girl for a while 
and she's really hot.  I want the condoms because I think tonight's 
"the" night.  We're having dinner with her parents, and then we're 
going out.  And I've got a feeling I'm gonna get lucky after that. 
Once she's had me, she'll want me all the time, so you'd better give 
me the 12 pack."  The young man makes his purchase and leaves.   Later
that evening, he sits down to dinner with his girlfriend and her 
parents.  He asks if he might give the blessing, and they agree.  He 
begins the prayer, but continues praying for several minutes.  The 
girl leans over and says, "You never told me that you were such a 
religious person."  He leans over to her and says, "You never told me 
that your father is a pharmacist."
