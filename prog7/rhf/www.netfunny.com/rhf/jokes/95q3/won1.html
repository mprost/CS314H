<PRE>[Note - what follows is the first part of the one-liner file.  As with all
	r.h.f. "digests", the jokes contained herein are "sub-standard" jokes
	(with apologies to the authors) - jokes which are funny, but which
	don't really warrant posting by themselves.  As such, they vary
	greatly in quality, topic, and offensive nature.  If such material
	does not interest you, feel free to skip it and the parts which follow.

	As I said, the topic matter varies greatly, and folks who are easily
	offended will likely find something in these digests which offends
	them.  To quote Dennis Miller, "...people who are threatened by jokes
	are the same people who tend to refer to actors on soap operas by their
	characters' names.  Listen, there's the Real World, and then there's
	the Joke World, ok?  The Joke World can get tough.  Wear a cup."  To
	use my own words, it's just a joke - ed.]

Subject: Gump Math

A math teacher at my brother's school held a Creative Writing in 
Mathematics contest.  Students were asked to finish the sentence "Math 
is like a box of chocolates..."  The grand prize winning entry was 
submitted by a sixth grader:

"Math is like a box of chocolates -- it's best when you use your fingers."

Subject: Movie Madness

(original, inspired by a recent r.h.f ballad on the subject)

	Those who claim that seeing things in movies does not affect what
people do in real life may have to reconsider their position:  look at
what Lorena Bobbitt did after seeing "Free Willy"...

Subject: Microsoft ads

	This is original --

	Recently I've been seeing lots vague of Microsoft ads on TV, with
the tag line, "Where do you want to go today?"

	My immediate response was, "Chicago.  But I can't get there until
August!"

Subject: New race track in the works

I just heard this one today. Sorry, I have no idea of its roots.

Did you hear that Tanya Harding and Mickael Jackson are building a race track
together? Tanya will take care of the handicapping and Michael will ride the
three year olds.

Subject: When she just wants to be friends

I was recently telling a friend of mine about a rectent romantic
endeavour. I told him that first she asked me not to push her into
making a decision on our relationship, but I couldn't wait, so she
turned me down.

My friend said "OK, so you backed off, then you backed on, and then you
were backed over."

Subject: Silly pilots

After landing his 747 plane on JFK airport, the captain says to his co-pilot:

Co-pilot: "Yes but it is certainly one of the widest"

I was at a concert for the band God Lives Underwater at the Khyber Pass

named "Maids of Gravity," where the bassest was heard saying...

"We've got 4 records out...all same title...all same artwork..."

Subject: A man walks into a bar 

Overheard on the New York subway:

It's 1972, and Jesus comes into a disco.  He pays the cover, but he
just can't seem to score, every song that comes on he moves like a dead
white guy.  So after a while he takes a break, buttonholes the
bartender and says,

"Darn it!  I've risen, and I can't get down!"

Subject: Follow up joke...
 
After reading a recent joke on here, from Jonathan Katz, I
came up with a twist on it.


Q: So, if people that love the English are called Anglophiles,
   and people that love the French are Francophiles, what
   are people that love Americans called?

A: Americans.

Subject: Watch what you ride...

A friend of mine relayed a conversation he had with another friend of his...

Jack (describing his girlfriend's friend, trying to be nice):
	Well... she's a bit overweight... not much to look at...

Bill (catching on to what Jack REALLY means, but is being nice):
	Oh, you mean she's a moped.

J:	A moped?!?
B:	Yeah, fat chicks are like mopeds.  They're fun to ride,
	but you don't want your friends to see you on one...
