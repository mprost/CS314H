Two guys met on the street and one asked "What's a masochist?"

Subject: That explains the guns

Heard this from a caller on KSFO a local conservative talk radio station:

David Koresh claimed he was Jesus Christ.  But a lot of folks were
wondering if he was Jesus, why did he have all those guns?  Well, after
what happened the first time, who could blame him?

A friend and I were walking to the beach when we passed a car

MY LIFE" were blazoned in large letters....

Comic John Mendoza cited this (on Comedy Central's "Big Deal") as one of

Subject: Rule by Intimidation

A friend of mine flies airplanes for recreation and mentioned that I wanted
a helicopter to beat the speed limits on the local roads.  So, I asked him
if a helicopter was considered an airplane.

He responded, "No, they're different.  An airplane glides through the air
  while a helicopter beats the air into submission."
