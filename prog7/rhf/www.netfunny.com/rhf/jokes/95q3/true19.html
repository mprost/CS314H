[Note - What follows is one part of the True News Digest - a collection of
	true-life stories which didn't really warrant individual posting, but
	which are amusing nevertheless.  The digest is quite long, and it will
	appear in 22 parts over the next few months - ed.]

made the following comment about the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty:

		"The Maastricht treaty ... has been dealt, at least 
temporarily, a fatal blow."

Subject: American workers and customers deserve each other

This story is true.  A store at the Stanford Shopping Center was
having a 30% off sale.  In front of me in line is this middle-aged
woman who looks vaguely troubled as the clerk is totalling up her
purchases.  Finally, she asks the clerk, "Is it 30% off <b>each</b> *item*?
Or only 30% off at the very end?"  The clerk tells her that first they
total up the purchases normally, and then they subtract the 30%.  The
woman seems even more troubled at this point, and then observes (to no
one in particular), "You don't save very much that way...."

From the Los Angeles Times (whenever Paul Simon's "Rhythm of the Saints"
album came out):

	RICHMOND, Va. -- Comedians Chevy Chase and Steve Martin took
turns holding down a giant Casper the Friendly Ghost balloon as the
pair helped singer Paul Simon make a new music video.

	[paragraph describing the video deleted]

	Martin signed just one autograph, for Carrie Cheeley, an
8-year-old baton twirler.

	"This certifies that you have had a personal encounter with
me and that you found me warm, polite, intelligent and funny,"
Martin wrote.

Subject: error messages

I think the best computer generated error message of all time is (
directly from the system log):
IEC020I NON-ACCEPTABLE ERROR

geesh! what about all the acceptable error the computer never told me
about!

In a related vein, one day I was greeted by the following logon 
message:

*** TSO IS BACK TO NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES..........
WE ARE EXPERIENCEING HARDWARE PROBLEMS CAUSING DEGRADATION OF TSO....

hmmmm....true confessions????

Subject: Sign Location

     Sometimes the location of a sign is says as much as the sign itself.
     Take these for example:

	-----------------------------------
	| Cruise Ships - Use airport exit |
	-----------------------------------
		- highway in San Diego, California

	All of the cruise ships I saw on the highway got off there. 

     Or another good example:
        -------------------------------------------------
        | Now entering the town of York.                |
	| All Building codes will be strictly enforced. |
	-------------------------------------------------

	It's next to a large field.  There's not a building within a mile.
	Maybe the building codes were TOO strictly enforced?

     Or yet a third.
	------------------------------------
	| Big Flats - Planned and Growing. |
	------------------------------------

	It's next to their cemetary.  Is this where Steven King gets his ideas?

     So keep your eyes open.  You'll find sign locations most important at 
times.

Subject: Legal Notice - Is this BAD money?

SG92-145 (First Published in the Daily Reporter, March 11, 1992)
IN THE EIGHTEENTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT DISTRICT COURT SEDGWICK COUNTY, KANSAS CIVIL
DEPARTMENT

THE STATE OF KANSAS, ex rel
NOLA FOULSTON, District Attorney for the 
Eighteenth Judicial District of the State of Kansas             Plaintiff
	vs.
$290.00 in U.S. Currency                                        Defendant
NOTICE OF SUIT Case No. 92 C670

The State of Kansas to all persons or entities who claim an interest in the
defendant property:

You are hereby notified that a Petition and Order to Show Cause has been filed 
in the Sedgwick County District Court, Civil Department, by the Sedgwick County
District attourney, praying for  the forfeiture of the defendant property set
out above, and you are required to appeat, answer, respond, or otherwise plead
to the Petition on or before the 30th day of April, 1992.  If you fail to plead
a judgment and decree will be entered forfeiting any interest you may have in
said property.

Seen in the Derby Kansas Newspaper on 3/18.  

A few questions come to mind:

1. Is this bad money?  Just what did this money do?  Any cash I've seen tends to
leave my immediate vicinity as soon as it sees me.

2. Did this cash come to life and commit a crime?  Must not be a crime since
it's being sued in civil court.

3. What property does this $290 have that the state of KS would want?
They must be a gang activity, right?  I'm not aware of a 290 dollar bill.

You know it's time to give up writing a paper when you awake with your head

Subject: more bathroom graffiti

There's a small town in Ohio called Yellow Springs, known for it's very
left-wing inclinations.  Many people of alternative lifestyles live in
Yellow Springs, and it's also the location of Antioch College, which was
notorious in the 60's for having "free-thinking" attitudes about education and
lots of flower children as students.  This graffiti was seen on the bathroom 
wall at Ha Ha Pizza in Yellow Springs:

"The hippies will rise again."

Underneath in another handwriting:

"But the day will be half over."

   Unemployment checks will be delayed three to four days starting
   tomorrow as Bay Area offices of the Employment Development
   Department [California's unemployment office] switch over to
   a faster automated system.

I can't wait for them to come up with new ways to process my tax refund...

Note: PCAS is a system in the UK for the administration of college applications.


PCAS form - Confidential statement by referee 

Mr xxx has positively uttered absurd premature eroticism of memoir for the 
BTEC National Sheepskin in Computer Discipline at this Lyceum. So dramatically 
he is arraying an excellent consequence in his garbage year.

\. . .

The Poly replied...

I am in receipt of a PCAS application from Mr xxx ( a copy of which is enclosed)

I refer to the reference shown and would ask for your comments as to its 
authenticity. If the first paragraph was caused by a "gremlin" in the works
perhaps you would send me an amended copy, however if this reference does not
come from you your comments would be appreciated.

\. . . 

Dear Mrs. Green,
	I enclose the correct reference for Mr. xxx, a student in my tutor group
at this college.

I must apologise for the incorrect version which had been corrupted by a bug in my thesaurus on my system.. Although I had carefully checked the text on screen
we did have to hurry the application process in December due to a threatened 
postal strike.

CORRECTED FIRST PARA
====================

Mr. xxx has successfully completed his first year of study for the BTEC National
Diploma in Computer Studies at this College, and so far he is showing an 
excellent progression in his second year.
