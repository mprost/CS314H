[Note - What follows is one part of the True News Digest - a collection of
	true-life stories which didn't really warrant individual posting, but
	which are amusing nevertheless.  The digest is quite long, and it will
	appear in 22 parts over the next few months - ed.]

This is true.  Here in Berkeley, Politically Correctness center of the galaxy,

My nomination for Worthless Product of The Year
(spotted in the "Univ. of Texas Lifetime Health Letter"):
--------
BEANS: NO MORE EMBARRASSING ENCORES

If you love beans and other high-fiber foods but often pass them up
because of disconcerting sound effects, help is on the way.

A commercially produced enzyme called "Beano" (Lactaid Inc.) reduces
flatulence from gas-producing foods such as beans, lentils, peas,
broccoli, cabbage, onions and eggplant.  Made from the fungus
_Aspergillus niger_, Beano prevents flatulence by breaking down
gas-producing sugars.  You simply add about five drops of the liquid to
your first bite of an offending food - and the enzyme does the rest.
One warning: because Beano is derived from a fungus, it may cause
gastric upset in people who are allergic to molds or penicillin.

Funny thing happened today in Poli-sci...

Prof tells us that there will be a test next Wednesday -
30 multiple guess questions on material in the chapter,
videos we've watched, and classwork.

He then asked if we would like for him to tell us where
exactly the information is located.  So I piped up -
"Sure, and why don't you give us the answers as well,"
- you know, just a smartass comment.  The prof then
promptly rattled off all 30 of the answers - much too
quickly to write down, let alone realize that that was
what he was doing.

Damn - looks like it's time to start taping lectures....
or get a memory upgrade.

Subject: Hose humor

This guy noticed that the flight attendant had a run in her
pantyhose. "Hey lady, you got a runner," he says to her quietly
as she walked past him in the aisle.  As he points to the run on
her leg, she replied, "I'd rather consider it a Highway to
Heaven!"  Believe it or not, this really happened to a flight
attendant (it was the 40-year-old flight attendant from Delta
that had PMS, but probably not while the hose ran on her thigh).

 The mouse on my Apple Macintosh jammed a day or two ago, so I
took it to pieces to see what was wrong with it. It turned out to
have a small piece of cheese wedged inside it -- I'd been using
it on the dining-room table.

 So now I know why they're called mice... our cats don't seem to
be interested in them, however, and they don't seem to make
people stand on chairs, as in early 60s sit-coms.

[original and true, although the names have been changed]

My friend Richard was a white water rafting guide for several years in
Northern California.  His company used to exchange float trips for
medical services.  Everybody was happy: the guides were kept healthy,
the doctors got some raft trips, and the raft company cut its medical
expenses.  At some point Richard needed a routine checkup; he inquired
at the rafting company offices and was told that they would set up an
appointment with a certain Dr. Kurt Sandstrom in San Francisco.

Richard drove into The City, and at the appointed hour arrived at the
offices of one Dr. Kurt Sandstrom, gynecologist.  Richard, enlightened
young man that he was, knew something that many do not know;
gynecologists are real doctors, and are perfectly capable of doing
"regular things" and not just "whatever it is that gynecologists do,
but we musn't talk about."  Since the white water rafters tend to be a
fun-loving bunch, he also knew that he had been set up by the
company's secretary.  Nevertheless, after a moment's amused
reflection, he strolled into the office, and presented himself at the
desk.

"Hi, my name's Richard Draper, I've got an appointment with Dr.
Sandstrom at ten o'clock."  As it happened, the doctor's staff seemed
also to be unacquainted with the versatility of gynecologists.  They
were puzzled, and embarrassed, and they attempted to send Richard away,
without using the "G" word.

"There must be some mistake; we don't think you have an appointment
with the doctor," replied one of the staff.  

"Gosh, I drove all the way out here, could you just check the books?"
asked Richard.

Upon doing so, they discovered that there was, indeed, a ten o'clock
apointment for one R. Draper.  "Well, there seems to be an appointment
for you, but there must be a mistake.  Dr. Sandstrom can't be your
doctor."

"Well, why not? He is a doctor, isn't he?"  Richard is very bright
fellow, but he looks very much like a surfin' dude and can play very
dumb when he wishes.

The office staff hemmed and hawed, trying to get Richard to leave, but
he wouldn't be rebuffed.  Finally one of the staff layed it out for
him, plain enough for even a surfer to understand: "you can't see the
doctor, because he's a gynecologist."

"That's okay, my ear hurts too," replied Richard.  

He saw Dr. Sandstrom at ten o'clock sharp.

Not sure if this is truly "topical", but heard this on CNN.  A reporter is
doing a human interest story on Sunday, April 7th, the eve of baseball
season.  A bunch of young kids are playing sandlot ball.  The reporter
stops one of the kids, who can't be older than 10, and starts asking him
all these typical questions about "Isn't baseball great?", etc.  Then he
says...

	REPORTER: Is there anything better than baseball?

	YOUNG KID: Not that I know of.
