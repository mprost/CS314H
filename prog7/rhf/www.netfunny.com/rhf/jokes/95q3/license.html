Heard from an elementary school principal:

  Two young boys were discussing their parents, when one realized
he really knew very little about his mother.  Arriving home that
evening, he gave her a third degree examination.

  "How old are you?" he asked.

  "None of your business," replied his mother, shortly.

  "Okay, then how much do you weigh?"

  "That's not your business either, young man."

  The boy thinks a minute, then delivers his final bombshell.  "Well
then, can you tell me why you and daddy got divorced?"

  Shocked and apalled, mom sends junior to bed without supper.

  The next day, the kid reports his failure to his schoolmate.  "I
know!" says his buddy, "Just look at her driver's license in her
purse.  It'll tell you everything you want to know."

  Later that day, mom finds her son next to her disembowled purse,
holding her driver's license.  "Just what the hell do you think you
are doing?" she yells.

  "Well, you wouldn't tell me what I wanted to know," says the junior
detective, "but my friend said it's all right here.  See, you're 40
years old...you weigh 145 pounds...and daddy divorced you 'cause you
got a 'F' in Sex."
