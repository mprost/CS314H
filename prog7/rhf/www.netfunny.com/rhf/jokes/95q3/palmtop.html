I found this blurb in a distribution message describing some of the
topics on a video magazine we have access to:

     ...It also takes an in-depth look at how HP's palmtop 
     computers have helped investigators study one of the most 
     devastating acts of domestic terrorism in U.S. history...

I didn't know that Win95 would even RUN on a palmtop.
