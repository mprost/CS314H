While going through his wife's dresser drawers, a farmer discovered 
three soybeans and an envelope containing $30 in cash.  The farmer 
confronted his wife, and when asked about the curious items, she 
confessed: 
<P>
"Over the years, I haven't been completely faithful to you." 
<P>
"When I did fool around, I put a soybean in the drawer to remind 
myself of my indiscretion," she explained. 
<P>
The farmer admitted that he had not always been faithful either, 
and therefore, was inclined to forgive and forget a few moments of 
weakness in his wife. 
<P>
"I'm curious though," he said, "Where did the thirty dollars 
come from?" 
<P>
"Oh that, " his wife replied, "Well, when soybeans hit ten dollars 
a bushel, I sold out!"
