<STRONG>[Ed: There are lots of these around.  These ones are probably a bit lesser 
known.]</STRONG>

Eugene d'Albert (noted German composer) was married six times. 
At an evening reception which he attended with his fifth wife shortly 
after their wedding, he presented the lady to a friend who said 
politely, "Congratulations, Herr d'Albert; you have rarely introduced me 
to so charming a wife." 
<P>
<HR>
During a visit to America, Winston Churchill was invited to a 
buffet luncheon at which cold fried chicken was served.  Returning for a 
second helping, he asked politely, "May I have some breast?" 
<P>
"Mr. Churchill," replied the hostess, "in this country we ask 
for white meat or dark meat."  Churchill apologized profusely. 
<P>
The following morning, the lady received a magnificent orchid 
from her guest of honor.  The accompanying card read: "I would be most 
obliged if you would pin this on your white meat." 
<P>
<HR>
Sentenced to two years hard labor (for Sodomy), Oscar Wilde 
stood handcuffed in driving rain waiting for transport to prison.  "If 
this is the way Queen Victoria treats her prisoners," he remarked, "she 
doesn't deserve to have any." 
<P>
<HR>
James McNeill Whistler's (painter of "Whistler's Mother") 
failure in his West Point chemistry examination once provoked him to 
remark in later life, "If silicon had been a gas, I should have been a 
major general." 
<P>
<HR>
(German philosopher) Georg Wilhelm Hegel, on his deathbed, 
complained, "Only one man ever understood me."  He fell silent for a 
while and then added, "And he didn't understand me." 
<P>
<HR>
Driving through a Swiss city one day, Alfred Hitchcock suddenly 
pointed out of the car window and said, "That is the most frightening 
sight I have ever seen."  His companion was surprised to see nothing 
more alarming than a priest in conversation with a little boy, his hand 
on the child's shoulder.  "Run, little boy," cried Hitchcock, leaning 
out of the car.  "Run for your life!" 
<P>
<HR>
Grover Cleveland, though constantly at loggerheads with the 
Senate, got on better with the House of Representatives.  A popular 
story circulating during his presidency concerned the night he was 
roused by his wife crying, "Wake up!  I think there are burglars in the 
house." 
<P>
"No, no, my dear," said the president sleepily, "in the Senate 
maybe, but not in the House." 
<P>
<HR>
Will Rogers, having paid too much income tax one year, tried in 
vain to claim a rebate.  His numerous letters and queries remained 
unanswered.  Eventually the form for the next year's return arrived.  In 
the section marked "DEDUCTIONS," Rogers listed: "Bad debt, US Government 
-- $40,000." 
<P>
<HR>
Lady Astor was giving a costume ball and Winston Churchill asked 
her what disguise she would recommend for him.  She said, "Why don't you 
come sober, Mr. Prime Minister?"
