Hey, this is John... Been breaking into root again, huh?  I logged you out 
so nobody would notice.  What's this pillar of salt doing next to your 
terminal?  You get weirder every day.  Damn, what did you do to your bed? 
It looks like someone took a Cuisinart to it...  Guess you had some fun... :) 
Speaking of which, you should be down in the stat lab.  Linda is down there 
acting horny as hell.  She's begging all the geeks to go to bed with her. 
Looks like you're missing out...
