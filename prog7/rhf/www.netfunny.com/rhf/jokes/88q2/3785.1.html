This really happened. 8-) 
<P>
A woman with a broken ankle was gingerly hobbling along on crutches 
as she attempted to walk her dog.  Because of her handicap, however, 
she was having a lot of trouble keeping the dog under control. 
Finally, the dog lunged forward, the leash slipped out of her 
hand, and the dog went running down the street.  She called and 
called, but the dog wouldn't come back.  Since she couldn't chase 
after it, she eventually gave up and went home. 
<P>
A couple of hours later she heard something scratching at the door. 
When she went to the door she found her dog standing there with a 
dead rabbit in its mouth.  Upon closer inspection, she realized it 
was the neighbors' pet rabbit.  She knew she would never be able 
to tell them what happened, and since they were out of town for the 
weekend, she hit upon a plan. 
<P>
She took the rabbit into the bathroom, washed it off, and blew 
its fur dry.  Then she took the rabbit back to the neighbors' 
backyard and put the rabbit back in its cage.  She thought the 
neighbors would discover the rabbit dead and think it died in the 
cage.  They would never suspect what really happened. 
<P>
On Monday, there was a knock at the door, and when she answered, there 
was her neighbor standing there.  He asked her if she had seen anyone 
in their backyard over the weekend.  She said no.  He said, "Did you 
see anything strange going on around our house or yard?"  Again, she 
denied seeing anything suspicious.  She said, "Why are you asking me 
these questions?  What happened?"  He said, "Well, something really 
strange is going on in my backyard.  On Friday our rabbit died, so we 
buried it in the backyard.  But when we came back from the weekend, 
it was back in the cage!" 
<P>
<STRONG>[Ed: This is, of course, one of the jokes which is described as an ``urban 
legend'' in that series of books.  It reminds me of the story of the 
Australian baggage handlers 
who found a dead cat in an animal shipment container.  Worried they 
would get in trouble over it, the went out and bought a similar cat 
and replaced the dead one.  Little did they know that the cat was 
being shipped back to its owner for burial.  Now that's service! ]</STRONG>
