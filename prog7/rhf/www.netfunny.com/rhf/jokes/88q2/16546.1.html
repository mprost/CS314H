( Apologies to all to whom this is not culturally relevant! ) 
<P>
A joke told to me by one of the staff at church on Sunday: 
<P>
The somewhat old and crusty vicar was taking a well-earned retirement from 
his rather old and crusty parish. As is usual in these cases, a locum was 
sent to cover the transition period. This particular man was young and 
active, and had the strange notion that church should also be active and 
exciting. As a consequence he was more than a little disapointed with the 
dull and tradition-bound church. He decided to do something about it. 
<P>
For his first Sunday, he didn't wear the traditional robes and vestments, 
but lead the service wearing a nice 2-piece suit. The congregation was 
horrified! He changed the order of the service. The congregation was 
horrified! Then came the children's lesson. 
<P>
For this he came out of the pulpit, and sat on the communion table. 
The congregation was mortified! He sat there swinging his legs against 
the table as the children gathered around him. The congregation were 
totally beside themselves! 
<P>
He asked the children, "What's small, brown, furry and eats nuts?" 
<P>
There was total silence. 
<P>
He asked again, "What's small, brown, furry and eats nuts?" 
<P>
Total silence. 
<P>
Eventually, one timid youngster put up his hand and said, "Please, Sir, 
I know the answer is Jesus, but it sure sounds like a squirrel to me."
