Paraphrased from joke told by Prof. Ed Landesman, University of
California at Santa Cruz:

   Two math professors, Dr. Smith and Dr. Jones, are dining together
   in a restaurant.  Dr. Smith is disillusioned about math teaching,
   and he says that he doesn't think people bother to learn what they
   teach, and that they shouldn't bother teaching math in the first
   place.  Dr, Jones is trying to convince him otherwise, that people
   do listen in math class.  They decide to settle their argument by
   asking their waiter a calculus question, and see if he gets the
   right answer.  When Dr. Smith gets up to use the restroom, Jones
   calls the waiter over.  Handing him a $20 bill, he says "When my
   colleague returns, I am going to ask you what the integral of ln x
   is, and you are to respond 1/x dx."  The waiter agrees and walks
   off.  When Smith gets back, they call the waiter over, and Jones
   asks him the question, which he answers correctly, much to Smith's
   surprise.  As they walk out the door, Smith apologizing to Jones,
   the waiter calls out after them, "Plus a constant!"
