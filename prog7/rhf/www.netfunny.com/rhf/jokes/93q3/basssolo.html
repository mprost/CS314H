As told to me by my music teacher.... 
<P>
This guy goes on vacation to a tropical island. As soon as he gets 
off the plane, he hears drums. He thinks "Wow, this is cool." He goes to 
the beach, he hears the drums, he eats lunch, he hears drums, he goes to 
a luau, he hears drums. He TRIES to go to sleep, he hears drums. 
<P>
This goes on for several nights, and gets to the point where the 
guy can't sleep at night because of the drums. Finally, he goes down to 
the front desk. 
<P>
When he gets there, he asks the manager "Hey! What's with these 
drums. Don't they ever stop? I can't get any sleep." 
<P>
The manager says, "No! Drums must NEVER stop. Very bad if drums 
stop." 
<P>
"Why?" 
<P>
"When drums stop...  bass solo begins." 
<P>
