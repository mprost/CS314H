<P>
I heard this many years ago in the Broadway show "Suger Babies." 
<P>
Joe, the fisherman, had driven by the lake many times and had seen 
some other anglers about, so he decided to give his luck a try.  On 
his first day of fishing he had no luck at all but noticed that 
another fisherman near him that was scooping in one after another. 
He had to know The Secret. 
<P>
"Excuse me sir, but would you mind telling me what sort of bait you 
are using?" he asked. 
<P>
The other man looked around a bit embarrassed.  "Well, I am a surgeon, 
and quite by accident I found that human tonsil works very well." 
<P>
Joe thanked the man, thought about what sort of bait to try next 
time, and left. 
<P>
The next day, Joe returned to the lake, tried a different bait and 
still had no luck.  Just as the day before, there was yet a 
different man realing in fish after fish. 
<P>
"Excuse me," asked Joe, "but could you suggest a bait that I could 
try?" 
<P>
"Well, I can but I am not sure it will do you any good.  I am using 
a bit of human appendix." 
<P>
"Hmm," thought Joe.  It seemed that the fish in this lake would 
require a little more effort than normal.  He left, willing to give 
the lake one more try. 
<P>
On the third day, Joe still had no luck.  As was usual, there was 
yet another man near him bringing in fish left and right. 
<P>
Joe wanted to confirm what he already knew. "Excuse me sir, but are 
you a doctor?" 
<P>
"No, I am a Rabbi." 
<P>
