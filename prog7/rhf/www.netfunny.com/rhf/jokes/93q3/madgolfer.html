<PRE>(A coworker says that his friend saw this happen.  I don't care if
it's an urban legend or not, it cracked me up.)

  An obviously upset golfer drove his cart over to the edge of a small
river winding through the course.  He stomped out of the cart, grabbed
his entire golf bag, and heaved it into the middle of the river.  He
then headed toward the parking lot, apparently never to golf again.
The friend watched the man walk out into the parking lot, stop, turn
around, and walk all the way back to the river.  He was sure that the
man had cooled off and was going back to get his clubs.
  Sure enough, the angry man waded into the river up to his waist and
picked up his golf bag.  He then unzipped the pocket, grabbed his car
keys, threw the bag back down, and left.
