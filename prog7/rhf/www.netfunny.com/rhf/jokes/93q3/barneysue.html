Once again, as a service to the readers of the Politics list, 
I submitted the following as an article in the Virtual World 
News (our very own Electronic Tabloid Paper, run by me.)

<H4>TV STAR TEARFULLY ADMITS, "I WAS ABUSED AS A CHILD," FILES LAWSUIT</H4>
<P>
AGAINST HOLLYWOOD BIGWIGS FOR "EXPLOITATION" 
<P>
The cushiony king of children's public television says his life hasn't been 
as soft as it may appear.  Barney T. Dinosaur, in an emotional press conference 
last week, admitted that his upbringing at the hooves of other dinosaurs 
was a harrowing experience. 
<P>
"Nobody liked me," the star said, as he filed a formal lawsuit against 
Steven Spielberg and various persons and institutions involved with 
the making of the film "Jurassic Park."  The suit contends that Barney, 
as the last surviving member of the species is entitled to be compensated for 
the use of his family name (Barney's middle name, it appears, is 
"Tyrannosaurus"--"The" is just a stage name) and history.  "For the hell 
I went through as a little-saur," Barney said, "I deserve every cent I can 
get.  Even the bracheosaurs used to beat up on me." 
<P>
According to the megastar dinosaur, he was considered an outcast in the 
rough-and-tumble prehistoric world because he was "different."  His voice 
lost its usual enthusiasm as he remembered:  "They were big and mean and 
tough.  I was soft and weak--plush, even--and they hurt me for it.  They 
hated me."  A strange, unfamiliar glint came into the star's eyes. 
"But I outlasted them all, anyway.  I showed them." 
<P>
Scientists on the Virtual World News' permanent payroll claim that it was 
Barney's differences that saved his hide, when all the other dinosaurs 
disappeared.  Though the cause of the extinction (now known to have been 
only a near-extinction) remains a mystery, it is now believed that 
giant space creatures may have descended in hunger--and eaten the 
dinosaurs.  Barney, however, was unpalatable, being entirely too sweet 
for the extraterrestrial diners.  In addition, having plush upholstery-type 
hide, rather than the normal dino-hide made him appear to the Visitors 
as somewhat similar to our "gumdrops"--which, of course, no one in their 
right mind would eat. 
<P>
The makers of Jurassic Park, including Spielberg himself, are contesting 
Barney's claim to the name "Tyrannosaurus."  "Don't be stupid," 
Spielberg reportedly responded.  "I made up the name myself.  It's all 
made up.  It's all fantasy.  Besides, Barney's just a sick little guy 
in a big purple suit.  I've seen him on the Paramount lot.  He's 
no creature.  He's just creepy." 
<P>
Other dinosaurs were extinct at press time, and unavailable for comment.
