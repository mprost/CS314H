<PRE>[After reading the *regulary posted*  alt.poly advertisement before putting
 it in my kill file, I felt so inclined to compose the following -- please,
 no flames, I'm not trying to make fun of anybody.]


The group alt.polynomials is for discussions about those with multiple
terms.  If you're interested in this subject, please check it out.  If
your site does not carry the group, either write your news administrator
or request that it be added, or send me email and I'll see what I can do.
There is also a group, alt.functions.poly, used for advertising the
functions offerred by the many-nomial culture.

Polynomial is a word, recently cointed, intended to connotate "multiple
terms", which follows pretty directly from poly and nomial.  However,
people on the group have many different viewpoints.  Some invovled are 
interested in algebraic relationships with 3 or more terms within a
specific set.  Some are more casual.  Some find that one term ends up
being their primary one and others, secondary.  Others find that all
terms can be equal.  Some are joined, some are anded.  Most believe
that truth and openness between all involved is of paramount importance. 

Please don't drop by if all you want to do is flame.  Yes, we are aware
that monomials exist.  Yes, we are aware that many people are happier
with single terms.  Congratulations.  Go do your thing, and we'll do ours.
We are also aware that having multiple "nomials" presents a calculated
risk compared to having precisely one faithful term.  Practice safe 
computations of your polynomial relationships and be honest with your
paterner about your activities. 

Followups are directed towards soc.algebra.  If you don't want to see this
message, add the subject to your kill file; it doesn't change.
