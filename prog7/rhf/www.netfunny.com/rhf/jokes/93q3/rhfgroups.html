In response to some complaints about the moderators of rec.humor.funny, 
the following new newsgroups have been proposed: 
<P>
<H4>rec.humor.not.funny.enough</H4>
<P>
This newsgroup will contain one posting, detailing the very object 
guidelines for postings which will be accepted.  There will be no other 
postings.  Submissions should be sent to jokes@automagic.rejecter. 
The purpose of this newsgroup is to streamline the rejection process for 
those who are tired of submitting jokes to funny@clarinet.com, only to have 
to wait several weeks or months to get a note that their submission has been 
rejected due to some subjective judgement by the moderators.  All requests 
made to this new address will be immediately rejected and the requester 
will receive immediate feedback. 
<P>
<H4>rec.humor.punny</H4>
<P>
Puns may be judged by the moderators of rec.humor.funny to be one of the 
lowest forms of humor, but we don't think so.  This newsgroup is designed 
solely for puns.  Remember, when puns are outlawed, only outlaws will be 
punished. 
<P>
<H4>wreck.humor.punny</H4>
<P>
For bad puns about whorable accidents.  See also "rec.humor.punny." 
<P>
<H4>rec.humor.funny.funny</H4>
<P>
Tired of wading through all the postings on rec.humor.funny? 
This newsgroup will contain only those postings from rec.humor.funny 
that are actually FUNNY.  The criteria for funniness will be completely 
subjective and left solely to the discretion of the moderators. 
An alternate name of rec.humor.funnier has also been proposed. 
<P>
<H4>rec.humor.funniest</H4>
<P>
This newsgroup is also moderated and is designed to be even more selective 
than rec.humor.funny.funny.  Only one posting will ever appear. 
Only the funniest joke will be posted.  The moderators will take submissions 
until such time as they deem, on purely subjective criteria, that they 
have received THE funniest joke, period. 
<P>
