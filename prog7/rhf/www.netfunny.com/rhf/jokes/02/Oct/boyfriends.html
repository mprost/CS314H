</PRE>When I was 16, I hoped that one day I would have a boyfriend... 
<P>
When I was 18, I got a boyfriend, but there was no passion. 
So I decided I needed a passionate guy with a zest for life. 
<P>
In college, I dated a passionate guy, but he was too emotional. 
Everything was an emergency, he cried all the time and threatened 
suicide. So I decided I needed a guy with stability. 
<P>
When I was 25, I found a very stable guy but he was boring. 
He was totally predictable and never got excited about anything. 
Life became so dull that I decided I needed a guy with some 
excitement. 
<P>
When I was 28, I found an exciting guy, but I couldn't keep 
up with him. He always got mad, he did impetuous things 
and flirted with everyone he met. He made me miserable as 
often as happy. He was very energetic, but directionless. 
<P>
So I decided to find a guy with some ambition. 
<P>
When I turned 31, I found a smart, ambitious guy with his 
feet planted firmly on the ground and married him. He was 
so ambitious that he divorced me, took everything I owned, 
and ran off with my best friend. 
<P>
I am now 40, and I'm looking for a guy with a big dick.
