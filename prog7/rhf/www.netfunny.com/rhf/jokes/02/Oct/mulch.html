</PRE>Upon observing the way we waste our precious natural resources, 
imagine the conversation The Creator might have with St. Francis: 
<P>
"Frank, you know all about gardens and nature. What in the world is 
going on down there? Where are all of the dandelions, violets, thistle 
and stuff I planted eons ago? I had the perfect no-maintenance garden 
plan. My plants grew in any type of soil; they withstood drought, and 
multiplied with abandon. The nectar from the long-lasting blossoms 
attracted butterflies, honeybees, and flocks of songbirds. I expected 
to see a vast garden of color by now, but all I see are these green 
squares." 
<P>
"It's the tribes that settled there, Lord. The Suburbanites. They 
started calling your flowers 'weeds' and went to great extent to kill 
them and replace them with grass." 
<P>
"Grass? But, it's so boring. It's not colorful. It doesn't attract 
birds or bees, only grubs and sod worms. It's temperamental with 
temperatures. Are you sure they really want all that grass growing 
there?" 
<P>
"Apparently so, Lord. They go to great pains to grow it, and keep it 
green. In the Spring they fertilize the grass, and kill any other 
plants that crop up." 
<P>
"The spring rains and cool weather probably make the grass grow really 
fast. That must make the Suburbanites happy." 
<P>
"Apparently not, Lord. As soon as it grows a little - they cut it." 
<P>
"Cut it? Do they then bale it like hay?" 
<P>
"No, not exactly, Lord. Most of them rake it up and put it in bags." 
<P>
"Oh. Is it a cash crop? Do they sell the bags?" 
<P>
"No sir, just the opposite. They pay taxes for the bags to be hauled 
off." 
<P>
"Now, let me get this straight. They fertilize the grass so it will 
grow, and when it does grow they cut if off and pay to throw it away?" 
<P>
"Yes, sir." 
<P>
"Then, these suburbanites must be relieved in the summer when we cut 
back on the rain and turn up the heat. That surely slows the growth 
and saves them a lot of work." 
<P>
"Sit down, Lord. When the grass stops growing, they drag out the hoses 
and pay more money to water it, so they can continue to mow it and pay 
to have it hauled off." 
<P>
"What nonsense! At least they kept some of the trees. That was a sheer 
stroke of genius, if I do say so myself. The trees grow leaves in the 
spring to provide beauty and shade in the summer. In the Autumn they 
fall to the ground and form a natural blanket to keep moisture in the 
soil and protect the trees and bushes. Plus, as they rot, the leaves 
form a compost to enhance the soil." 
<P>
"You still sitting, Lord? The Suburbanites have grown a new circle. As 
soon as the leaves fall, they rake them, bag them, and pay to have 
them hauled off." 
<P>
"You're kidding! What do they do to protect the shrub and tree roots 
in the winter, or keep the soil moist and loose?" 
<P>
"After the leaves are hauled off they buy something they call mulch 
and spread it around under the trees." 
<P>
"And where do they get this mulch." 
<P>
"They cut down the trees and grind them up." 
<P>
"ENOUGH! I don't want to think about this anymore. St. Catherine, 
you're in charge of the arts. What movie have you scheduled for us 
tonight?" 
<P>
"Dumb and Dumber, Lord. It's a real stupid movie about..." 
<P>
"Never mind, I think I just heard the whole story." 
<P>
