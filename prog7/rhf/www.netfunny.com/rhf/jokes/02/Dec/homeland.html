&gt;From: Tom Ridge<BR>
Director of Homeland Security<BR>
<P>
&gt;To:   George J Tenet<BR>
Director of Central Intelligence<BR>
<P>
</PRE>At 0010 eastern time yesterday, an unauthorized aircraft was 
detected entering restricted airspace over the Washington DC 
metro area.  Intercept planes were immediately scrambled and 
the offending vehicle was brought down.  We are currently 
analyzing the wreckage to determine the nature and origin of 
this intrusion. 
<P>
The reason I bring this to your attention is that the Central 
Intelligence Agency has once again failed to provide useful 
warning about this incursion.  We were required to rely on our 
own informant, codename Virginia, to find out who the pilot of 
the aircraft was.  We are currently investigating this matter 
and would appreciate your help. 
<P>
Unfortunately, we were not as successful in finding out who or 
what our informant's source is.  Virginia would only repeat the 
name Daa-Dee, which must be a codename.  Given the nature of 
the intrusion and secrecy maintained by it's members, we can 
only assume that this is the action of an al Qaeda cell.  We 
are currently taking appropriate retaliatory steps. 
<P>
Fortunately, the secret court was able to try our informant as 
an adult.  This 12 year old has already been tried, sentenced 
and executed as a traitor of the homeland.
