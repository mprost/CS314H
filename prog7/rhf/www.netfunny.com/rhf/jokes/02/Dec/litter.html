<P>
</PRE>A couple of weeks ago, I succumbed to an ill-begotten urge to purchase 
an electric cat box. 
<P>
That's right, an electric cat box. You heard right. 
<P>
Here's the concept: the cat box is equipped with a disposable container, 
a sensor, a timer &amp; a mechanized "rake." When the cat makes a 'deposit," 
the sensor recognizes the event, the timer allows a respectful interval 
to elapse, and the rake then drags itself through the cat litter and 
deposits the waste in the disposable container. Every few days, one 
replaces the disposable container and the kitty litter chores are done. 
<P>
Now, just to get this out of the way, yes, it was expensive. $80 for 
this bit of frivolity, but I figured I was darn well worth it. 
<P>
It did, however, present a bit of a learning curve for the kitties, who 
had been used to one sort of litter; the new kitty box required 
clump-able litter. This stuff is rather like sand, but when in contact 
with litter, a clump is formed. Initially, however, Ling thought it was 
some sort of a spa: he leaped into the litter box and rolled around in 
it like he was trying to cover every atom of his fur with litter. He 
then promptly curled up in the box and took a nap. 
<P>
Not to be daunted by this, however, I decided to help the cats to learn 
the true purpose of the electric litter pan. Being a nurse - and a 
resourceful one at that - I produced a small urine sample in a 
disposable dixie cup and poured this in the pan to the amazement of the 
kitty crew. They stared transfixed at the lump as it coalesced there, 
and watched in total awe as the mechanical arm drug the rake through the 
litter and deposited my sample into the disposable bin. Thereafter, the 
cats were totally enthralled by this new device and quickly began to use 
the pan exclusively. We rarely saw them after that. If by chance their 
attention spans waned before the raking process started, they would run 
from any portion of the house after hearing the motor begin and stare in 
rapt glee as the evidence of their potty habits vanished into the bin. 
<P>
And yes, you are correct, there IS more to this tale. 
<P>
The "rake" is attached to the mechanical arm that powers it back &amp; forth 
through the litter by means of a snap-in attachment that, after the 
second "sweep," neither snapped in nor attached on one side of the box. 
At first this was a fairly minor irritation, but over time, it became 
more and more of an issue. 
<P>
Initially, small bits of cat litter were gently deposited on the other 
side of the bin, i.e. on the floor outside of the box. Soon the level of 
enthusiasm generated by the rake escalated, however. And now we had a 
new form of entertainment for the feline family members: 
<P>
The great American shit toss. 
<P>
Yes indeed, soon the rake began to drag so badly on one side of the box 
that it would lag well behind the rest of the process until rounding the 
corner to (allegedly) deposit the turds in the bin. As a result, it 
became the kitty litter equivalent of Babe Ruth. 
<P>
The cats were endlessly fascinated by this new permutation. They 
determined ONLY to poop on that side of the box, and to poop in petite 
amounts. I think they were taking bets on distance before this whole sad 
event concluded. 
<P>
And they are in DEEP mourning now that we switched back to the old 
manual system.
