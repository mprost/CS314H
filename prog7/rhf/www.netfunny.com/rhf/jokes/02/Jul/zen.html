<P>
<PRE>1. Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. 
   Do not walk ahead of me, for I may not follow. 
   Do not walk beside me either. Just leave me the hell alone. 
<P>
2. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a broken fan belt 
   and a leaky tire. 
<P>
3. It's always darkest before dawn. So if you're going to steal your 
   neighbour's newspaper, that's the time to do it. 
<P>
4. Sex is like air. It's not important unless you aren't getting any. 
<P>
5. Don't be irreplaceable. If you can't be replaced, you can't be promoted. 
<P>
6. No one is listening until you fart. 
<P>
7. Always remember you're unique. Just like everyone else. 
<P>
8. Never test the depth of the water with both feet. 
<P>
9. If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple 
   of car payments. 
<P>
10. Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. 
    That way, when you criticize them, you're a mile away and you have 
    their shoes. 
<P>
11. If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you. 
<P>
12. Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach him how to fish, 
    and he will sit in a boat and drink beer all day. 
<P>
13. If you lend someone $20 and never see that person again, it was 
    probably worth it. 
<P>
14. If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything. 
<P>
15. Some days you are the bug; some days you are the windshield. 
<P>
16. Don't worry; it only seems kinky the first time. 
<P>
17. Good judgment comes from bad experience, and a lot of that comes from 
    bad judgment. 
<P>
18. The quickest way to double your money is to fold it in half and put it 
    back in your pocket. 
<P>
19. A closed mouth gathers no foot. 
<P>
20. Duct tape is like the Force. It has a light side and a dark side, and 
    it holds the universe together 
<P>
21. There are two theories to arguing with women. Neither one works. 
<P>
22. Generally speaking, you aren't learning much when your lips are moving. 
<P>
23. Experience is something you don't get until just after you need it. 
<P>
24. Never miss a good chance to shut up. 
<P>
25. We are born naked, wet, and hungry, and get slapped on our ass ... 
    then things get worse. 
  
<P>
