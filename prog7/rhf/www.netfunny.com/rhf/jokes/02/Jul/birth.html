</PRE>Should kids witness a birth? A true story: 
<P>
It was late at night and Heidi, who was expecting her second child was home 
alone with her 3-year old daughter Katelyn. 
<P>
When Heidi started going into labour, she called "911." Due to a power 
outage at the time, only one paramedic responded to the call. 
<P>
The house was very,very dark, so the paramedic asked Katelyn to hold a 
flashlight high over her mommy so he could see while he helped deliver the 
baby. 
<P>
Very diligently, Katelyn did as she was asked. Heidi pushed and pushed, and 
after a little while Connor was born. 
<P>
The paramedic lifted him by his little feet and spanked him on his bottom. 
Connor began to cry. 
<P>
The paramedic then thanked Katelyn for her help and asked the wide-eyed 
3-year old what she thought about what she had just witnessed. 
<P>
Katelyn quickly responded, "He shouldn't have crawled in there in the first 
place. Smack him again!" 
<P>
