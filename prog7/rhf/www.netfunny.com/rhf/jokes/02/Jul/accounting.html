</PRE>The current scandals over how large companies have been cooking the books 
reminds me of a basic accounting course I took years ago. The professor was 
explaining an accounting method called First In Last Out, which is useful 
for industries that accumulate large inventories of stuff. It explains why 
the oil industry, for example, reported huge profits during the 1970's when 
the oil shortage occured. They stopped buying oil, so they had to use oil 
that, on paper, had been purchased in the 1930's at 20¢ a barrel. They of 
course sold it at current market prices, which accounted for their huge 
profits. 
<P>
One of the students put up his hand and said, "Excuse me, sir, but 
that doesn't sound very ethical to me." To which the professor replied, 
"You're in the wrong class, son, this is Accounting 101. Ethics 101 is two 
doors down the hall, on the left."
