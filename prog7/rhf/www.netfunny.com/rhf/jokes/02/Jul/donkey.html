</PRE>A city boy, Kenny, moved to the country and bought a donkey 
from an old farmer for $100.00. The farmer agreed to deliver 
the donkey the next day. The next day the farmer drove up 
and said, "Sorry son, but I have some bad news, the donkey 
died." 
<P>
Kenny replied, "Well then, just give me my money back." 
<P>
The farmer said, "Can't do that. I went and spent it 
already." 
<P>
Kenny said, "OK then, just unload the donkey." 
<P>
The farmer asked, "What ya goanna do with him?" 
<P>
Kenny, "I'm going to raffle him off." 
<P>
Farmer, " You can't raffle off a dead donkey!" 
<P>
Kenny, "Sure I can. Watch me. I just won't tell anybody he 
is dead." 
<P>
A month later the farmer met up with Kenny and asked, "What 
happened with that dead donkey?" 
<P>
Kenny, "I raffled him off. I sold 500 tickets at two dollars 
apiece and made a profit of $898.00." 
<P>
Farmer, "Didn't anyone complain?" 
<P>
Kenny, " Just the guy who won. So I gave him his two dollars 
back." 
<P>
Kenny grew up and eventually became the chairman of Enron.
