<P>
</PRE>With apologies to Don McLean... 
<P>
<BR>A long, long time ago<BR>
I can still remember how computing<BR>
used to be worthwhile.<BR>
<P>
And I knew from the day I was born<BR>
that I could make that code perform<BR>
and maybe I could do it with some style.<BR>
<P>
But last September made me shudder,<BR>
with every 'nouncement Carly uttered.<BR>
<P>
Bad news in my In-tray,<BR>
I couldn't take one more day.<BR>
<P>
I can't remember if I sighed when I<BR>
read about our latest stride,<BR>
something cut me deep inside,<BR>
the day the HPWay died.<BR>
<P>
So<BR>
<P>
&lt;Chorus&gt;<BR>
<P>
Purge, purge, Ms. Technology Scourge,<BR>
Drove my Beetle to the Needle,<BR>
Now my job's on the verge.<BR>
<P>
Them Compaq boys were<BR>
drinking Starbuck's and Surge<BR>
singing "This'll be the day that we merge,<BR>
This'll be the day that we merge."<BR>
<P>
Did you write the Book of DOS<BR>
And do you believe an albatross<BR>
Can really save our company?<BR>
Now do you believe in buying time?<BR>
Can Compaq save our bottom line?<BR>
And can you teach me how write a resume?<BR>
<P>
Well, I know you hatched that plot with him<BR>
'Cause I saw you climb out on that limb.<BR>
You both threw down your stock<BR>
'Cause you thought this deal was a lock.<BR>
<P>
I was a middle-aged computer geek<BR>
With a second mortgage that I closed last week<BR>
But I knew Sun was worth a peek<BR>
The day the HPWay died.<BR>
<P>
I started singing<BR>
<P>
&lt;Chorus&gt;<BR>
<P>
Now for some time we've been on our own<BR>
Since Bill and Dave left us alone<BR>
But it's not how it used to be.<BR>
When the managers still walked around<BR>
And talked to people who touched the ground<BR>
They could hear ideas from you and me.<BR>
<P>
But now when the Queen is looking down<BR>
The worker bees just fly around<BR>
The boardroom is reserved<BR>
No progress is observed.<BR>
And while Carly read a book on Dell<BR>
The stock price slowly went to hell<BR>
And we tried so hard not to sell<BR>
The day the HPWay died.<BR>
<P>
We were singing<BR>
<P>
&lt;Chorus&gt;<BR>
<P>
Arbitrage, arbitrage in the garage<BR>
Employees fleeing from the barrage<BR>
Of all the spin on HPNow.<BR>
Green cards, white cards flying around,<BR>
Shareholders want good reasons found<BR>
With employees on the sidelines tied and bound.<BR>
<P>
Now the meeting air was full of gloom<BR>
While the board played their tired old tune.<BR>
We all got up to vote<BR>
Oh, but they said we rocked the boat.<BR>
Then when Walter tried to make his speech,<BR>
Carly told him to "just go teach"<BR>
Do the by-laws allow impeach?<BR>
The day the HPWay died.<BR>
<P>
&lt;Chorus&gt;<BR>
<P>
They say we were in a shipwreck<BR>
A generation mired in Tech<BR>
Lethargic and pedestrian.<BR>
So come on everybody let's just grow<BR>
We'll be as big as IBM you know<BR>
'Cause size is the CEO's great plan.<BR>
<P>
Oh, and as they watched her on the stage,<BR>
They all began to see a sage<BR>
Everyone in The Flint<BR>
Was finally taking the hint.<BR>
And as the white cards flew into her sight<BR>
The crowd could finally "see the light"<BR>
I saw Carly smiling with delight<BR>
The day the HPWay died.<BR>
<P>
I was singing<BR>
<P>
&lt;Chorus&gt;<BR>
<P>
I met a girl who looked amused<BR>
And I asked her what PC she used<BR>
She just smiled and said, "Gateway."<BR>
I went down to the comp'ny store<BR>
Where I'd bought HP shirts years before<BR>
But the man there said he's out of "HP Way."<BR>
<P>
And in our cubes we reminisced<BR>
Of ways of business that were dissed<BR>
But not a word was spoken<BR>
All of our hearts were broken.<BR>
And the two men I admired best<BR>
Bill and Dave were not at rest<BR>
The new guys did not pass the test<BR>
The day the HPWay died.<BR>
<P>
&lt;Chorus&gt;<BR>
