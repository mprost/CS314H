</PRE>This classic police blunder is taken from the autobiography 
of Keith Hellawell, who is prominent in the UK: 
<P>
One case nearly backfired on the officers involved. A man 
had been found dead in a one-up, one-down house on the 
outskirts of town. He had sustained multiple injuries, 
which the detectives managed to convince the Coroner's 
Court were self-inflicted. This was no mean feat, as he 
had been strangled, hit over the head, stabbed several 
times and then gassed. 
<P>
My colleagues claimed to have deduced that he was 
desperate to kill himself and had tried to strangle himself 
with the flex from the hanging light-bulb at the top of the 
stairs. They insisted his weight tore the fitting from the 
ceiling - a task undertaken, in fact, by the investigating 
officer - and he fell down the stairs, sustaining his head 
injuries. 
<P>
He survived the fall, and so, still determined, he crawled 
to a drawer, from which he pulled out a knife and stabbed 
himself. Unfortunately the knife had mysteriously 
disappeared from the scene, so one had to be provided for 
authenticity. 
<P>
In the end, still alive, he put his head in the oven and 
turned on the gas, by which means he finally achieved 
his task. 
<P>
There was a great deal of embarrassment when a man gave 
himself up and confessed to the murder. He served life 
imprisonment. 
<P>
(From 'The Outsider' by Keith Hellawell, HarperCollins.)
