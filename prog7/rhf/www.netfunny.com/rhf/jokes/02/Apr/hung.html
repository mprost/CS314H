</PRE>Jim and Roger were patients in a Mental hospital.  One day while 
they were walking past the hospital swimming pool, Jim suddenly jumped in to 
the deep end.  He sunk to the bottom and stayed there. 
<P>
Roger promptly jumped in to save him.  He swam to the bottom and 
pulled Jim out.  When the medical director became aware of 
Rogers heroic act he immediately ordered him to be discharged from the 
hospital, considered him to be mentally stable. 
<P>
When he went to tell Roger the news he said, "Roger, I have good news 
and bad news.  The good news is you're being discharged because since 
you were able to jump in and save the life of another patient, I think 
you've regained your senses.  The bad news is Jim, the patient you saved, 
hung himself with his bathrobe belt in the bathroom. I am so sorry, 
but he's dead." 
<P>
Roger replied, "He didn't hang himself, I put him there to dry." 
<P>
(As told to me by Raz8@aol.com, my attorney-friend)
