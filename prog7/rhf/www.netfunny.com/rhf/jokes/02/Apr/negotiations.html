</PRE>The Prime Minister of Israel sits down with Arafat 
at the beginning of negotiations regarding the 
resolution of the conflict.  The Prime Minister 
requests that he be allowed to begin with a story. 
Arafat replies, "Of course." 
<P>
The Prime Minister begins his story: "Years before 
the Israelites came to the Promised Land and settled 
here, Moses led them for 40 years through the desert. 
The Israelites began complaining that they were thirsty 
and, lo and behold, a miracle occurred and a stream 
appeared before them.  They drank their fill and then 
decided to take advantage of the stream to do some 
bathing--including Moses.  When Moses came out 
of the water, he found that all his clothing was missing. 
<P>
"Who took my clothes?"  Moses asked those around him. 
<P>
"It was the Palestinians," replied the Israelites--" 
<P>
"Wait a minute," objected Arafat immediately, "there were 
no Palestinians during the time of Moses!" 
<P>
"All right," replies the Prime Minister, "Now that we've got 
that settled, let's begin our negotiations." 
<P>
