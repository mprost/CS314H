<P>
</PRE>A school teacher injured his back and had to wear a plaster 
cast around the upper part of his body. It fit under his shirt 
and was not noticeable at all. 
<P>
On the first day of the term, still with the cast under his 
shirt, he found himself assigned to the toughest students in 
school. 
<P>
Walking confidently into the rowdy classroom, he opened the 
window as wide as possible and then busied himself with desk 
work. When a strong breeze made his tie flap, he took the desk 
stapler and stapled the tie to his chest. 
<P>
He had no trouble with discipline that term.
