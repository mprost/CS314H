</PRE>A man returning home a day early from a business trip, got into a taxi at the 
airport after midnight.  While en route to his home, he asked the cabby if he 
would be a witness.  The man suspected his wife was having an affair, and 
expected to catch her in the act.  For $100, the cabby agreed to be a witness. 
<P>
Quietly arriving at the house, the husband and cabby tiptoed into the 
bedroom.  The husband flipped on the lights, pulled the blanket back and 
there was his wife in bed with another man. 
<P>
The husband put his gun to the man's head, and the wife shouted "Don't do it! 
This man has been very generous.  Who do you think paid for the Corvette I 
said I bought for you?  He did!  Who do you think paid for our new cabin 
cruiser?  He did!  Who do you think pays our monthly country club dues you 
believe I budget for?  He does!" 
<P>
The husband, looked over at the cab driver and asked "What would you do?" 
<P>
The cabby said, "I'd cover him with that blanket before he catches a cold."
