</PRE>A 75 year old man went to his doctor's office to get a sperm count. 
<P>
The doctor gave the man a jar and said, "Take this jar home and bring 
back a semen sample tomorrow. 
<P>
The next day the 75 year old man reappeared at the doctor's office 
and gave him the jar, which was as clean and empty as on the previous 
day. 
<P>
The doctor asked what happened and the man explained, "Well, doc, 
it's like this: First I tried with my right hand, but nothing. Then I 
tried with my left hand, but still nothing. Then I asked my wife for 
help. She tried with her right hand, and then her left, still nothing. 
She even tried with her mouth; first with the teeth in, then with her 
teeth out still nothing. We even called up Earleen, the lady next 
door and she tried too, first with both hands, then an armpit, and she 
even tried squeez'n it between her knees, but still nothing. 
<P>
The doctor was shocked! "You asked your neighbor?" 
<P>
The old man replied, "Yep, but no matter what we tried, we still 
couldn't get that damned jar open." 
<P>
