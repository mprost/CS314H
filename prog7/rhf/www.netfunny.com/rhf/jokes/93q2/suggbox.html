I asked Dan Judd, a graduate student who works for me, to look into creating 
an electronic suggestion box for the dean of the college.  This is what he 
came back with. 
<P>
Options for creating an anonymous suggestion box for the Dean. 
<P>
<PRE>1) Slip note under Dean's door. 
     Pro - Simple. 
           Would cost less to implement than generating this report. 
     Con - Only small notes fit.  
           Not too anonymous in the middle of the day. 
<P>
2) Put note in box outside Dean's office. 
     Pro - Simple.  
           Anonymity reasonable during the day. 
           Box can be easily emptied into trash at end of day. 
     Con - Requires ability to find the Dean's office. 
           Suggestions weighing more a few pounds unworkable. 
           Box can be easily emptied into trash at end of day. 
           Will probably get more gum wrappers that suggestions. 
<P>
3) Mail to an address that strips off headers and forwards to Dean. 
     Pro - Easy to do from anywhere in the building. 
           Big messages not a problem. 
           Electronic messages are easy to delete. 
     Con - Won't be able to strip .signature files from the end of messages. 
           Requires users have access to e-mail. 
           Electronic messages are easy to delete. 
           Requires Dean read e-mail 
    
4) A 'suggest' command that sends message to appropriate place. 
     Pro - No problem with signatures. 
           Fairly simple. 
     Con - Requires that users remember command exists. 
           Requires an account and the ability to create a file on Unix. 
           Requires Dean read e-mail. 
<P>
5) Printer in Dean's office for suggestions. 
     Pro - Hard copy made of suggestions. 
           Draws attention to itself, increasing the likelyhood suggestions  
           may be looked at. 
     Con - Printer must be on. 
           Queue not anonymous during printing. 
           Temptation to send the Kama Sutra may be too great for some. 
<P>
6) Suggestion posted anonymously to public news group. 
     Pro - Keeps people aware suggestion service exits. 
           Suggestions more likely to be dealt with in some manner. 
           Others can comment on suggestion along with the Dean. 
     Con - Some suggestions too personal to be posted. 
           Requires Dean read news. 
     
7) Coup d'etat. 
     Pro - Eliminates need for anonymity. 
           Eliminates need for suggestions. 
     Con - Difficult to automate. 
<P>
