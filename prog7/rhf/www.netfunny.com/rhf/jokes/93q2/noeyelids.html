<PRE>A friend was telling Cherie, my wife, about a child born at the local
hospital with an unusual birth defect.  She explained that this new
child, a baby boy who was otherwise normal, was born without eyelids.

"How terrible," replied Cherie, feeling quite sorry for the child,
"he'll never be able to blink.  

"It's very sad", replied the friend, "his eyes are constantly
irritated, and he has to sleep with them open."  

By this time Cherie was most upset, feeling very, very sorry for
this little boy.  "Isn't there anything they can do for them?" she asked.

"As a matter of fact, the doctors plan to circumcise him and use the
foreskin to build eyelids."  she replied.  "It's quite amazing what
they can do these days, isn't it?"

The conversation continued, my wife feeling greater and greater
symphathy for both the child and his parents with every minute. 
Finally, the friend (I assume not being able to keep a straight face
any longer) dropped the line:

   "Ya, you've really got to feel sorry for the kid, he's gonna be
    cock-eyed for the rest of his life...."
