Quiz: Test Your Computer Term Savvy! 
<P>
Over the past few years I've begun to notice an insidious new trend in the 
way computers and peripherals are named.  The loathsome practice of making 
up a meaningless word for a product name, often ending in "a," had been 
confined to the auto industry (what DO words like "Elantra," "Previa", or 
"Acura" actually mean?!?), or so we had thought... 
<P>
It started slowly, with company names like "Compaq," many years ago.  Then 
it began to build up steam with the creation of words like "Advantis" and 
"Futura."  Now it's an entrenched phenomenon, and I've come up with a quiz 
to test YOUR knowledge of this hot marketing fad! 
<P>
