[I originally posted this to comp.sys.mac.???, where yet another 
my-computer-is-better religious war had finally degenerated into 
something a bit more fun to read.  So I added to the inspired mess 
this piece of foolishness, which I believe is original.  Somebody 
suggested I send this to rec.humor.funny, so I cleaned it up a bit, 
added some late-breaking thoughts, and took the plunge.  Here is my 
two seconds of fame....] 
<P>
&gt;Babbage engine, circa 1843... 
&gt;Still using it daily. Works great as long as you oil it. 
<P>
&gt;I beat you all. 
<P>
Come on people: you are all missing the most obvious upgrade path to the 
most powerful and satisfying computer of all.  The upgrade path goes: 
<P>
<!--  bullets-->
<UL><LI>Pocket calculator 
<LI>Commodore Pet / Apple II / TRS 80 / Commodore 64 / Timex Sinclair 
(Choose any of the above) 
<LI>IBM PC 
<LI>Apple Macintosh 
<LI>Fastest workstation of the time (HP, DEC, IBM, SGI: your choice) 
<LI>Minicomputer (HP, DEC, IBM, SGI: your choice) 
<LI>Mainframe (IBM, Cray, DEC: your choice) 
</UL>
<P>
And then you reach the pinnacle of modern computing facilities: 
<P>
<!--  bullets-->
<UL><LI>GRADUATE STUDENTS 
</UL>
<P>
Yes, you just sit back and do all of your computing through lowly 
graduate students.  Imagine the advantages: 
<P>
<!--  bullets-->
<UL><LI>Multi-processing, with as many processes as you have 
students.  You can easily add more power by promising more 
desperate undergrads that they can indeed escape college 
through your guidance.  Special student units can even 
handle several tasks *on*their*own*! 
<LI>Full voice recognition interface.  Never touch a keyboard or 
mouse again.  Just mumble commands and they <B>will</B> be 
understood (or else!). 
<LI>No hardware upgrades and no installation required.  Every 
student comes complete with all hardware necessary.  Never 
again fry a chip or $10,000 board by improper installation! 
Just sit that sniveling student at a desk, give it writing 
utensils (making sure to point out which is the dangerous 
end) and off it goes. 
<LI>Low maintenance.  Remember when that hard disk crashed in 
your Beta 9900, causing all of your work to go the great bit 
bucket in the sky?  This won't happen with grad. students. 
All that is required is that you give them a good *whack!* 
upside the head when they are acting up, and they will run 
good as new. 
<LI>Abuse module.  Imagine yelling expletives at your computer. 
Doesn't work too well, because your machine just sits there 
and ignores you.  Through the grad. student abuse module you 
can put the fear of god in them, and get results to boot! 
<LI>Built-in lifetime.  Remember that awful feeling two years 
after you bought your GigaPlutz mainframe when the new 
faculty member on the block sneered at you because his 
FeelyWup workstation could compute rings around your 
dinosaur?  This doesn't happen with grad. students.  When 
they start wearing and losing productivity, simply give them 
the PhD and boot them out onto the street to fend for 
themselves.  Out of sight, out of mind! 
<LI>Cheap fuel: students run on Coca Cola (or the high-octane 
equivalent--Jolt Cola) and typically consume hot spicy 
chinese dishes, cheap taco substitutes, or completely 
synthetic macaroni replacements.  It is entirely unnecessary 
to plug the student into the wall socket (although this does 
get them going a little faster from time to time). 
<LI>Expansion options.  If your grad. students don't seem to be 
performing too well, consider adding a handy system manager 
or software engineer upgrade.  These guys are guaranteed to 
require even less than a student, and typically establish 
permanent residence in the computer room.  You'll never know 
they are around!  (Which you certainly can't say for an 
AXZ3000-69 150gigahertz space-heater sitting on your desk 
with its ten noisy fans....)  [Note however that the 
engineering department still hasn't worked out some of the 
idiosyncratic bugs in these expansion options, such as 
incessant muttering at nobody in particular, occasionaly 
screaming at your grad. students, and posting ridiculous 
messages on world-wide bulletin boards.] 
</UL>
<P>
So forget your Babbage Engines and abacuses (abaci?) and PortaBooks 
and DEK 666-3D's and all that other silicon garbage.  The wave of the 
future is in wetware, so invest in graduate students today!  You'll never 
go back! 
<P>
