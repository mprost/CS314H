[Heard on the local radio station here in London (Capital Radio)]

Two guys draw up to traffic lights, one in a Mini and the other in
a Rolls Royce. The guy in the Mini winds down his electric windows,
not to be outdone the Rolls driver winds his down in reply.

The Mini driver then presses a button to unwind his sun-roof, again
the Rolls driver does the same.

Next, the Mini driver presses a button which causes a double bed to appear
in the back of his car! The Rolls driver is gob-smacked and watches in
disbelief as the Mini drives off from the green light.

Immediately, the Rolls driver goes round to his local garage and asks for
the insto-bed to be fitted to his car. The mechanic tells him it will
be very expensive. The Rolls driver insists it is fitted and does not 
care about the cost.

A few weeks later he collects his car with the insto-bed fitted. He spends 
hours driving around looking for the Mini. Eventually, he finds it parked
in a lay-by. It's windows are all steamed up and the car is rocking.

The Rolls pulls up slowly, and he knocks on the window. After a short pause
the Mini drivers' head pops out.

"What?", says the Mini driver.

"Watch this!", says the Rolls driver.

He then depresses the button and smirks proudly as a double bed appears...

To which the Mini driver retorts, "You got me out of the shower to 
show me that!?".
