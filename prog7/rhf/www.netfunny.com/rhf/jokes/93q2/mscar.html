** IMPORTANT NEWS CLIPPINGS... ******************************************* 
<P>
"Uncle Bill" is in the Driver's Seat! 
<P>
January 25th, Redmond WA - Marketing reps from Microsoft Corporation 
today announced their new line of high-value sedans - yes, we mean 
automobiles!  Said Gates: "We feel that consumers are confused by the 
great variety of vehicles out there.  Every company offers their own 
proprietary version of your basic sedan, but there's no standard." 
Microsoft aims to define that standard with their new "Redmond" sedan. 
Here's just a quick tour of some of the state-of-the-art features that 
will make this the best set of wheels you'll ever drive: 
<P>
<!--  bullets-->
<UL><LI>Room for up to six passengers (although the current version 
only allows one occupant while the car is in motion. 
Microsoft claims that this will provide greater security for 
the passenger and vows to look into a true multi-passenger model. 
<LI>Free car phone! The "Redmond" includes a SONY(TM) model 
TCP-93.  This model only allows dialing out, so you'll have 
to purchase another phone if you wish to receive calls or 
communicate with other satisfied "Redmond" owners.  Microsoft 
expects that many third-party vendors will be glad to provide 
this added value. 
<LI>Revolutionary cache strategy allowed Microsoft to design the 
"Redmond" with just 3 wheels instead of one.  Just imagine 
the savings in tire-replacement! 
<LI>No speedometer, odometer, or gas-gauge.  Microsoft feels 
that it can deliver a higher-quality product by leaving off 
these frills in the initial offering.  This could also provide 
jobs for unemployed but enterprising auto workers who wish 
to  provide this product to you. 
<LI>An early prototype of the "Redmond" (code-named "Pong") had 
the obvious disadvantage of only supporting left turns.  The 
production-ready "Redmond" instead offers control-preserving 
but control-insensitive steering.  The steering column 
and directional signals allow you to signal and turn in 
either direction, and while the car "remembers" the 
direction you turned, it translates this into a left turn 
automatically.  Great news for people who always confuse 
left and right, and Microsoft provides a complimentary map 
of your town to aid you in finding paths that only include 
left turns. 
<LI>Should you be so old-fashioned as to not want to use some of 
these amazing new features, Microsoft again dazzles the 
critics by providing the "AmeriDrive" console.  This console 
allows you to drive the "Redmond" as you would any other 
American car.  The console supports the only available 
standards document (1.7b), so some minor features such as 
acceleration, steering, and braking are not fully supported. 
Microsoft fully stands behind AmeriDrive and maintains that 
it is "not just a check-box"
