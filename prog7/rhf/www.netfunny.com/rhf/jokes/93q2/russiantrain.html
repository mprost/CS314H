<PRE>The original form of this joke was releated to me by a co-worker, while
we were recently discussing the immediate Russian past.


A train was stalled on the Trans-Siberian Railway, on board were Tsar
Nicholas II, Lenin, Stalin, Khruschev, Breznhev, Chernynko, Andropov,
Gorbachev, and Yeltsin.

Tsar Nicholas stands up and says, "I shall make this train move." He gets
off the train, mounts his horse and rides off to Paris.

Lenin then stands up and says, "I shall make this train move." He leaves
the car and returns a few minutes later. "I've instituted a new 8 day work
week," he says and sits down.  The train still doesn't move.

Stalin stands up and says, "I shall make this train move." He leaves the car
and returns a few minutes later.  "I've shot the engineer," he says as he
sits down. The train still doesn't move.

Khruschev then stands up and says, "I shall make this train move." He leaves
the car and returns a few minutes later. "I've reinstated the engineer,
posthumously," he says as he sits down.  The train doesn't move.

Breznhev then stands up and says, "I shall make this train move." He then
instructs everyone to act like the train is moving and sits down. The train
doesn't move.

Chernynko and Andropov both jointly declare "We shall make this train move."
They then get off the train.  The train doesn't move.

Gorbachev, with a sigh, stands up and says "I shall make this train move." He
stands and, pulling down the window, yells outside "This train doesn't move!"
Gorbachev sits back down.  The train doesn't move.

Yeltsin, quite put out, stands up and says "I shall change the train for one
that works!"  He leaves and returns shortly with a new train.  As the 
passengers board it, they see that it is an old American Steam Engine which
is owned by the Germans and has no wheels.  Is this train going to move?
