<PRE>A joke from my step-dad, the fisherman:

  Two men are out on a froken lake ice fishing.  One man had been out on the
  lake for over two hours and he hasn't gotten a single bite.  The other man,
  just about a dozen feet away, had been on the lake for about half an hour,
  and he already had almost a bucket-full.

  This disturbed the other man greatly, so he walked over to him and asked
  him, "Excuse me, sir, but I'd been out 'ere fer a mighty long time and I
  ain't caught nuthin'.  How do you catch all them fish?"

  The other man looked at him and said, "Mummmummhummmummhummhmummm."

  "What did you say?"

  "Mummhummmummhummmumnmunhumm," mumbled the busy fisherman.

  "Sir, you got a speech impediment?  I can't here a darn word yer saying!"

  The fisherman pointed his finger up, indicating to wait a minute.  He pulled
  and reeled in his line and pulled and reeled in, and he cuaght another fish.

  "OK, darn it.  Either tell me now or else," said the angry 'amateur'.

  As the 'expert' removed the fish from the hook, he looked at the unfortuate
  man standing beside him.  He put the fishing pole down and took a large wad
  of something out of his mouth.

  "You have the keep the worms warm," he answered.
