I heard this from a friend the other day.  I'm sure it will no longer
be relevant under our wonderful new administration...


Three boys are standing around one day conducting a typical "my dad is
better than your dad" one-upsmanship session one day when the topic 
turns to whose father is really the fastest.

The first boy says, "my dad's so fast, he can shoot an arrow at a target
100 feet away, run after it, and catch it before it hits the target."

The second, not to be outdone, pipes up, "well _my_ dad is so fast, he
can shoot a .45 at a target 100 _yards_ away, run after the bullet, turn
around and catch it in his _teeth_ before it hits the target."

Well, the first boy is impressed, until the third kid chimes in.  "Shoot,
that's nothing", he says, "my dad works for the government.  He gets off
work at 5:00 and is home by 4:30."
