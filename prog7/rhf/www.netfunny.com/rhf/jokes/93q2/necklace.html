I heard this a long time ago:
 
    Friday evening around 7:30.
 
A young couple enters a jewelery store.  He, average looking, well
dressed, She, DROP-DEAD Beautiful, BUILT!
 
They walk up to the necklace counter and start brousing.(she is
giggling constantly, he's looking bored)  Shortly a clerk walks
up to them and asks if she can be of assistance.  The conversation
went as follows:
 
        He: "Yes, do you have anything GOOD?"
     Clerk: "OH, Yes!" (she starts to reach for a good looking piece
            in the display case)
        He: "Hold on.. Let's save some time.  Show me the BEST diamond
            necklace that you have on the premeses."
     Clerk: "Um, Yes Sir, I'll have to get the manager, it's in the
            safe."
        He: "I'll wait."
       She: (looks like a VERY happy puppy)
   Manager: (coming from the back with a box) "Sir, this is the best
            in the house." (he opens the box, there is a price tag of
            $23,000.00 on the necklace)
       She: (gasp!) (melt)
        He: (to she) "Would you like to try it on?"
       She: (nod vigorously)
        He: "Do you like it?"
       She: (*KISS*)
        He: "I'll take it.  You *DO* take personal checks don't you?"
   Manager: "Um, yes sir, but, being as this is friday and the banks
            have closed.  I can not release the necklace until I've
            verified funds.  You could pick it up Monday around noon."
        He: "Fine."
       She: (*KISS*,*KISS*,*KISS*)
 
Monday rolls around and the young man returns to the store.
 
   Manager: "YOU! HOW DARE YOU SHOW YOUR FACE!"
        He: "I know, I'm here to collect the check."
   Manager: "HERE! Now get out!"
        He: "Oh, One other thing."
   Manager: "What."
        He: "I'd like to thank you for the BEST weekend of my LIFE!"
