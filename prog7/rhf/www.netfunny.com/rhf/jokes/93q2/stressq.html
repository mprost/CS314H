As part of a seminar I recently attended on stress in the workplace, 
I was given a packet which included a family stress test. Our family found 
that all of the questions fell into what we considered the "wuss" category, 
and generated our own family stress test: 
<P>
Score 0 if the statement is never true, 1 if it is rarely true, 2 if 
it is sometimes true, and 3 if it is always true. 
<P>
<PRE>1. ____ Conversations often begin with "Put the gun down, and then we can  
	talk." 
<P>
2. ____ The school principal has your number on speed-dial. 
<P>
3. ____ The cat is on Valium. 
<P>
4. ____ People have trouble understanding your kids, because they learned to  
	speak through clenched teeth. 
<P>
5. ____ You are trying to get your four-year-old to switch to decaf. 
<P>
6. ____ The number of jobs held down by family members exceeds the number 
	of people in the family. 
<P>
7. ____ No one has <I>time</I> to wait for microwave TV dinners. 
<P>
8. ____ "Family meetings" are often mediated by law enforcement officials. 
<P>
9. ____ You have to check your kid's day-timer to see if he can take out  
	the trash. 
<P>
10.____ Maxwell House gives you industrial rates. 
<P>
  Scoring: 
<P>
	30 - a perfect score. Welcome to the neighborhood! 
<P>
	20-29 - You are doing reasonably well, but still have too little 
	 	going on in your life. Crank it up. 
	 
	10-19 - You have mastered some of the aspects of the stress-filled 
		life, but still have a long way to go. Have you considered 
	  	a parallel career path? 
<P>
	0-9 - Enjoying all that extra time? What do you <I>do</I> anyway? 
<P>
</PRE>
