<PRE>This is an excerpt from the Genetic Programming Mailing List,
genetic-programming@cs.stanford.edu, an email-only forum for the 
practitioners of genetic programming.  It is reprinted with the
permission of moderator James P. Rice, who is also the original
poster of this <b>quite</b> humorous piece of linguistic trivia.

&gt; From: James Rice &lt;rice@camis.stanford.edu&gt;
&gt; Subject: Re: Paper on Competitive Fitness Functions

  &lt;James Rice comments on Peter Angelines Submission to ICGA-93&gt;

&gt; Pete: I've started reading your paper.  When I have the time
&gt; I'll try and make some coherent comments, if you like.  Do you
&gt; want such things?  I know that when you get comments from a
&gt; bunch of people you can't satisfy them all (without making it as
&gt; long as War and Peace) and it always ends up like a camel.
&gt; 
&gt; I can give one unequivocal hint, though, which has nothing to do
&gt; with the paper per se, but is to do with making it globally
&gt; intelligible.  I'd suggest globally replacing the word "Quite"
&gt; with "Very".  In the US, Quite means Very, but in the
&gt; UK/Commonwealth it means Slightly.  Thus, if you were to say
&gt; that the evidence for your discoveries is quite strong, the rest
&gt; of the world would think that it was a non-result and dismiss
&gt; the paper.
&gt; 
&gt; I had been in this country for 2 years before I discovered this
&gt; linguistic difference.  I had always assumed that a word as
&gt; common as Quite would obviously mean the same thing.  My lady
&gt; friend (now wife) kept telling me that my cooking was quite
&gt; good.  I was suitably ego destroyed by this but (being British?)
&gt; did not visibly respond to the (perceived) insult and kept
&gt; trying harder to figure out how I could make my cooking better.
&gt; I couldn't figure out for the life of me why she needed to be so
&gt; rude, but assumed she had a good reason.
&gt; 
&gt; Of such things are marriages made?
&gt;
