<PRE>
The was a farmer who raised watermelons. He was doing pretty well but he was
disturbed by some local kids who would sneak into his watermelon patch at 
night and eat watermelons. After some careful thought he came up with a clever
idea that he thought would scare the kids away for sure. So he made up the sign
and posted it in the field. The next day the kids show up and they see
this sign,it says "Warning, one of the watermelons in this field has
been injected with cyanide." So the kids run off, make up their own
sign and post it next to the sign that the farmer made. The farmer
shows up the next week and when he looks over the field he notices that
no watermelons are missing but he notices a new sign next to his. He
drives over to the sign and takes a look, it says "Now there are two".
