</PRE>After his exam the doctor said to the elderly man, "You appear to be 
in good health. Do you have any medical concerns you would like to 
ask me about?" 
<P>
"In fact, I do," said the old man. "After I have sex with my wife, 
the first time I am usually hot and sweaty, and then, after I have sex 
with her the second time, I am usually cold and chilly." 
<P>
After examining the elderly lady, the doctor said, "Everything 
appears to be fine. Do you have any medical concerns that you would 
like to discuss with me?" 
<P>
The lady replied that she had no questions or concerns. 
<P>
The doctor then asked: "Your husband had an unusual concern. He 
claims that he is usually hot and sweaty after having sex the first 
time with you and then cold and chilly after the second time. 
<P>
Do you know why? 
<P>
"Oh that crazy old fart!" she replied. "That's because the first time 
is usually around July and the second time is usually in December!"
