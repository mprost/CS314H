</PRE>A retired gentleman went to the social security office to apply for 
Social Security.  The woman behind the counter asked him for his 
driver's license to verify his age.  He looked in his pockets and 
realized he had left his wallet at home. He told the woman that he was 
very sorry but he seemed to have left his wallet at home. "I will have 
to go home and come back later." The woman says, "Unbutton your shirt." 
So he opens his shirt revealing curly silver hair.  She says, "That 
silver hair on your chest is proof enough for me" and sheprocessed his 
Social Security application.  When he gets home, the man excitedly 
tells his wife about his experience at the social security office. She 
says, "You should have dropped your pants. You might have gotten 
disability too."
