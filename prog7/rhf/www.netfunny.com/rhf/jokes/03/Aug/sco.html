</PRE>DEAR SIR/MADAM: 
<P>
I AM MR. DARL MCBRIDE CURRENTLY SERVING AS THE PRESIDENT AND 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE SCO GROUP, FORMERLY KNOWN AS 
CALDERA SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, IN LINDON, UTAH, UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA. I KNOW THIS LETTER MIGHT SURPRISE YOUR BECAUSE WE HAVE 
HAD NO PREVIOUS COMMUNICATIONS OR BUSINESS DEALINGS BEFORE NOW. 
<P>
MY ASSOCIATES HAVE RECENTLY MADE CLAIM TO COMPUTER SOFTWARES 
WORTH AN ESTIMATED $1 BILLION U.S. DOLLARS. I AM WRITING TO YOU 
IN CONFIDENCE BECAUSE WE URGENTLY REQUIRE YOUR ASSISTANCE TO 
OBTAIN THESE FUNDS. 
<P>
IN THE EARLY 1970S THE AMERICAN TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH 
CORPORATION DEVELOPED AT GREAT EXPENSE THE COMPUTER OPERATING 
SYSTEM SOFTWARE KNOWN AS UNIX. UNFORTUNATELY THE LAWS OF MY 
COUNTRY PROHIBITED THEM FROM SELLING THESE SOFTWARES AND SO THEIR 
VALUABLE SOURCE CODES REMAINED PRIVATELY HELD. UNDER A SPECIAL 
ARRANGEMENT SOME PROGRAMMERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY OF 
BERKELEY DID ADD MORE CODES TO THIS OPERATING SYSTEM, INCREASING 
ITS VALUE, BUT NOT IN ANY WAY TO DILUTE OR DISPARAGE OUR FULL AND 
RIGHTFUL OWNERSHIP OF THESE CODES, DESPITE ANY AGREEMENT BETWEEN 
AMERICAN TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH AND THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY OF 
BERKELEY, WHICH AGREEMENT WE DENY AND DISAVOW. 
<P>
IN THE YEAR 1984 A CHANGE OF REGIME IN MY COUNTRY ALLOWED THE 
AMERICAN TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH CORPORATION TO MAKE PROFITS FROM 
THESE SOFTWARES. IN THE YEAR 1990 OWNERSHIP OF THESE SOFTWARES 
WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE CORPORATION UNIX SYSTEM LABORATORIES. IN 
THE YEAR 1993 THIS CORPORATION WAS SOLD TO THE CORPORATION 
NOVELL. IN THE YEAR 1994 SOME EMPLOYEES OF NOVELL FORMED THE 
CORPORATION CALDERA SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, WHICH BEGAN TO 
DISTRIBUTE AN UPSTART OPERATING SYSTEM KNOWN AS LINUX. IN THE 
YEAR 1995 NOVELL SOLD THE UNIX SOFTWARE CODES TO SCO. IN THE YEAR 
2001 OCCURRED A SEPARATION OF SCO, AND THE SCO BRAND NAME AND 
UNIX CODES WERE ACQUIRED BY THE CALDERA SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, 
AND IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE CALDERA SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL WAS 
RENAMED SCO GROUP, OF WHICH I CURRENTLY SERVE AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OFFICER. 
<P>
MY ASSOCIATES AND I OF THE SCO GROUP ARE THEREFORE THE FULL AND 
RIGHTFUL OWNERS OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARES KNOWN AS UNIX. 
OUR ENGINEERS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT NO FEWER THAN SEVENTY (70) 
LINES OF OUR VALUABLE AND PROPRIETARY SOURCE CODES HAVE APPEARED 
IN THE UPSTART OPERATING SYSTEM LINUX. AS YOU CAN PLAINLY SEE, 
THIS GIVES US A CLAIM ON THE MILLIONS OF LINES OF VALUABLE 
SOFTWARE CODES WHICH COMPRISE THIS LINUX AND WHICH HAS BEEN SOLD 
AT GREAT PROFIT TO VERY MANY BUSINESS ENTERPRISES. OUR LEGAL 
EXPERTS HAVE ADVISED US THAT OUR CONTRIBUTION TO THESE CODES IS 
WORTH AN ESTIMATED ONE (1) BILLION U.S. DOLLARS. 
<P>
UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY EXTRACTING OUR FUNDS FROM 
THESE COMPUTER SOFTWARES. TO THIS EFFECT I HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE 
MANDATE BY MY COLLEAGUES TO CONTACT YOU AND ASK FOR YOUR 
ASSISTANCE. WE ARE PREPARED TO SELL YOU A SHARE IN THIS 
ENTERPRISE, WHICH WILL SOON BE VERY PROFITABLE, THAT WILL GRANT 
YOU THE RIGHTS TO USE THESE VALUABLE SOFTWARES IN YOUR BUSINESS 
ENTERPRISE. UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE NOT ABLE AT THIS TIME TO SET A 
PRICE ON THESE RIGHTS. THEREFORE IT IS OUR RESPECTFUL SUGGESTION, 
THAT YOU MAY BE IMMEDIATELY A PARTY TO THIS ENTERPRISE, BEFORE 
OTHERS ACCEPT THESE LUCRATIVE TERMS, THAT YOU SEND US THE NUMBER 
OF A BANKING ACCOUNT WHERE WE CAN WITHDRAW FUNDS OF A SUITABLE 
AMOUNT TO GUARANTEE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS ENTERPRISE. AS AN 
ALTERNATIVE YOU MAY SEND US THE NUMBER AND EXPIRATION DATE OF 
YOUR MAJOR CREDIT CARD, OR YOU MAY SEND TO US A SIGNED CHECK FROM 
YOUR BANKING ACCOUNT PAYABLE TO "SCO GROUP" AND WITH THE AMOUNT 
LEFT BLANK FOR US TO CONVENIENTLY SUPPLY. 
<P>
KINDLY TREAT THIS REQUEST AS VERY IMPORTANT AND STRICTLY 
CONFIDENTIAL. I HONESTLY ASSURE YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% 
LEGAL AND RISK-FREE. 
<P>
