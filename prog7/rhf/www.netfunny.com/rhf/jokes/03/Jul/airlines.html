</PRE>A guy sitting at an airport bar in Los Angeles noticed a beautiful young 
woman sitting next to him. He thought to himself, "Wow, she's so gorgeous 
she must be a flight attendant. But which airline does she work for?" 
<P>
Hoping to pick her up, he leaned towards her and uttered the Delta slogan: 
"Love to fly and it shows?" 
<P>
She gave him a blank, confused stare and he immediately thought to himself, 
"Guess she doesn't work for Delta." 
<P>
A moment later, another slogan popped into his head. He leaned towards her 
again, "Something special in the air?" 
<P>
She gave him the same blank look. 
<P>
He mentally kicked himself, and scratched American Airlines off the list. 
<P>
Next he tried the United slogan: "I would really love to fly your 
friendly skies?" 
<P>
This time the woman turned on him, "What the f*** do you want?" 
<P>
The man smiled, then slumped back in his chair, and said... 
"Ahhh, South African Airways!!!!" 
<P>
