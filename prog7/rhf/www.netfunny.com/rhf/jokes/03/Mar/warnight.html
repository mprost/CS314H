<BR>'Twas the night before war, and all through the homeland,<BR>
Not a dissenter was stirring, by Ashcroft's command;<BR>
With Cheney all comfy, at an undisclosed location,<BR>
And Dubya on TV, destroying our nation.<BR>
<P>
The children were nestled, all duct-taped in beds,<BR>
While visions of dirty bombs danced in their heads;<BR>
Mamma and I listened to Dubya's obsession,<BR>
And then settled down for a long decade's recession.<BR>
<P>
When out on CSPAN there arose such a clatter,<BR>
I sprang from the couch to see what was the matter.<BR>
I grabbed the remote and turned up the sound,<BR>
Expecting King George was about to be crowned.<BR>
<P>
The Congressman stirred, they seemed rather nervous,<BR>
that George would announce the end of their service.<BR>
When what to my wondering eyes should appear,<BR>
But a presidential candidate, who looked oddly sincere.<BR>
<P>
A charming old lady, small but impressive,<BR>
I knew in a moment, she's a Progressive.<BR>
More rapid than eagles Dubya's coursers they came,<BR>
They whistled, and shouted, and doled out the blame.<BR>
<P>
"It's the liberals! The feminists! The gays, and that peacenik!<BR>
It's the French!, and the atheists!, and that stupid Dixie Chick!<BR>
They caused our crisis, not to mention the single moms.<BR>
Now get out of here lady, we've got a country to bomb!"<BR>
<P>
And then with a twinkling the old lady spoke,<BR>
Bush paced and he grimaced, his ears nearly smoked.<BR>
She talked of the future in her quiet calm way,<BR>
She talked about how, we all might live on that day.<BR>
<P>
The streams, how they twinkled! the lands how green!<BR>
The economy recovered, and new jobs to be seen.<BR>
The shouts continued, but she kept promoting her plan,<BR>
To change the whole world, over a twenty-year span.<BR>
<P>
Our dependence on oil causes no end of grief,<BR>
We must change our economy, was her ardent belief.<BR>
The middle class tax burden we could all bear,<BR>
If the companies based in Bermuda, would pay their fair share.<BR>
<P>
Bush stomped from the chamber and clenched his teeth,<BR>
The smoke from his ears encircled his head like a wreath;<BR>
I notice Perle's face, and a little round belly,<BR>
And how his jowls shook when enraged, like a bowlful of jelly.<BR>
<P>
I awoke on the couch from my short little doze,<BR>
On the TV I saw Dubya, still listing our foes.<BR>
The old lady who spoke was only a dream,<BR>
If a worthy candidate will run, remains to be seen.<BR>
<P>
The Democrats are spineless, the opposition a joke.<BR>
The media won't insult advertisers, and risk going broke.<BR>
But the future can change, a wise man once wrote,<BR>
And I know one thing for certain, I can't wait to go vote.<BR>
