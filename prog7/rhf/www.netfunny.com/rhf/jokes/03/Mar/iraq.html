</PRE>And so the Iraq jokes begin to roll in...  These are jokes which are funny, 
but which didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post such a digest 
whenever I have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly selective 
readers will probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to killfile 
RHF jokes with "Digest" in the title - ed.

&gt;Subject: French military victories<BR>
<P>
In view of current events at the UN, I looked up<BR>
"French military victories" at www.google.com and<BR>
hit the "I'm feeling lucky" button.<BR>
<P>
Google's response was:<BR>
<P>
&gt; Did you mean: french military defeats<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; No standard web pages containing all your search terms were found.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Your search - french military victories - did not match any documents.<BR>

&gt;Subject: Wow, and I thought "Freedom Fries" was bad<BR>
<P>
In a boldly patriotic move, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas)<BR>
has mandated that members of Congress use only the newly renamed<BR>
"Freedom Tickler" when screwing the American public.<BR>

&gt;Subject: Say no to war<BR>
<P>
White House has set up hotlines for peoples to say Yes or No to war. Please<BR>
call one of the following numbers:<BR>
<P>
1-800-I-SUPPORT to support the war against Iraq.<BR>
1-900-I-OPPOSE  if you oppose the war*.<BR>
<P>
*: There is a charge of $3.95 per minute fo this call. Minimum billing time<BR>

&gt;Subject: The Dixie Chicks<BR>
<P>
Some of you may have heard that at a recent concert, the Dixie<BR>
Chicks declared that they were "ashamed" of President Bush for the<BR>
upcoming Iraqi war.  Apparently this angered some people in Texas,<BR>
Bush's home state.  One headline I read said<BR>
<P>
Dix Chicks Ticks Hicks<BR>
<P>
This morning I read that some people are so angry, they're burning their<BR>
Dixie Chicks CDs.  I think the headline should be obvious:<BR>
<P>
Hicks Nix Dix Chicks<BR>
<P>
What I think the Dixie Chicks ought to do is to make amends by<BR>
canceling a half-dozen concert tickets bought by the chief UN arms<BR>
inspector.  No, it doesn't make a lot of sense, but we'd get to see<BR>
<P>
Dix Chicks Fix Hicks, Nix Six Blix Tix<BR>

&gt;Subject: Bush at war<BR>
<P>
The Boston Herald, on tuesday (3/18) had on its front cover a picture<BR>
of President Bush superimposed over the American flag.<BR>
<P>
In large letters cover 1/3 of the page, the caption read:<BR>
<P>
"Bush's Moment of Truth"<BR>
<P>
Hmmm.  You mean he's been lying to us up until now?<BR>

"You know the world is going crazy when the best rapper is a white guy,<BR>
the best golfer is a black guy,<BR>
The Swiss hold the America's Cup,<BR>
France is accusing the US of arrogance,<BR>
and Germany doesn't want to go to war."<BR>

&gt;Subject: The French retaliate<BR>
<P>
In retaliation against the US House of Representatives changing the names<BR>
of French fries and French toast to Freedom fries and Freedom toast in<BR>
their cafeteria, the French government has announced that they will NOT<BR>
change the name of American cheese.<BR>

A: "Yes. We kept the receipts."<BR>

&gt;Subject: European Values<BR>
<P>
On the NPR show, "Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me!" I heard the<BR>
following account on Saturday March 15, 2003:<BR>
<P>
A group of British paratroopers were firing their weapons<BR>
for practice near the Kuwait/Iraq border. A group of<BR>
Iraqi soliders, fearing the war had started, crossed<BR>
the border and promptly surrendered to the paratroopers.<BR>
<P>
My immediate thought was, "Finally, French culture has<BR>
spread to the Middle East."<BR>
