</PRE>On a tour of Texas, the Pope took a couple of days off to visit the coast 
for some sightseeing. He was cruising along the beach in the pope-mobile 
when there was a frantic commotion just off shore. A helpless man wearing 
a Green Bay Packer jersey was struggling frantically to free himself from 
the jaws of a 25-foot shark. 
<P>
As the Pope watched, horrified, a speedboat came racing up with three 
men wearing Minnesota Viking jerseys. One quickly fired a harpoon into 
the shark's side. The other two reached out and pulled the bleeding, 
semi-conscious Packer Backer from the water, Then, using long clubs, 
the three beat the shark to death and hauled it into the boat. 
<P>
Immediately the Pope shouted and summoned them to the beach. "I give you my 
blessing for your brave actions," he told them. "I heard that there was 
bitter hatred between Green Bay Packers &amp; Vikings fans, but now I have 
seen with my own eyes that this is not true."  As the Pope drove off, the 
harpooner asked his buddies "who was that"?  "It was the Pope," one replied. 
"He is in direct contact with God and has access to all of God's wisdom." 
<P>
"Well," the harpooner said, "he may have access to God's wisdom, but he 
doesn't know anything about shark fishing. Is the bait holding up O.K., 
or do we need to get another one"? 
<P>
