</PRE>A friend of mine related this story, which actually happened to him recently: 
<P>
By some means, he managed to knock the soap dish off the side of his 
tub.  He sent in a maintenance request to get it fixed, and then left town 
for a week.  Later, he pieced together the maintenance man must have come 
by pretty soon after he left, filled the empty screw holes with liquid 
nails (basically caulk), stuck the soap dish back on the wall, and then 
taped it to the side of the wall to hold it up while the caulk dried.  Now, 
this is perhaps not the best method of repair in the first place, but the 
maintenance man surely didn't expect it to fail as quickly as it did.  At 
some point not long after he "fixed" the dish, the tape gave way, and the 
soap dish fell, sticky side down, onto the bottom of him tub. 
<P>
So my friend arrived home after a week away, and finds that his soap dish 
has indeed been firmly reattached to his tub, albeit not in the way that he 
had intended it to be. 
<P>
