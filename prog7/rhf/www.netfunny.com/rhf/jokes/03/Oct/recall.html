</PRE>These are the better of the California recall jokes that I've received. 
These are jokes which are funny, but which didn't really warrant posting 
separately.  I post such a digest whenever I have enough entries to 
warrant it.  Particularly selective readers will probably not enjoy the 
digests, and may want to killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in the title - ed.

&gt;Subject: Joke about the News<BR>
<P>
</PRE>This was posted anonymously in the Atlanta Journal Constitution Vent 
(Found at external.html/metro/content/metro/vent/index.html). 
<P>
A midget, a bodybuilder and a porn star walk into a 
bar. The bartender looks up and says, "What is this, 
an election?"

<P>
Total Recall sends Davis away<BR>

Even your kids will worship Kindergarten Cop<BR>

&gt;Subject: Gary Coleman for Governor<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Gary Coleman said that if he's elected governor of California, he's going to 
build condos for "little people." Everything will be scaled down to their 
size. Kitchen cabinets lower, sinks, toilets, etc., lower. And the tenants will 
not have to pay any rent. 
<P>
They'll be known as Gary Coleman's Stay Free Mini-Pads.

&gt;Subject: Well I didn't vote for yer...<BR>
<P>
</PRE>"Well I didn't vote for him" 
<P>
"You don't vote for governors" 
<P>
"So how'd you become governor then?" 
<P>
"The recall vote held aloft Excalibur signifying by divine right that I, 
Arnold, should be governor of the Californians..." 
<P>
"Strange recalls distributing swords is no basis for a system of 
government! Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the 
masses, not some farcical recall ceremony. I mean, if I was to say I was 
a Governor, just because some moistened bint lobbed a scimitar at me, 
they'd put me away!" 
<P>
"Shut up! I ordar yow to shud up." 
<P>
"Help, help, I'm being disenfranchised" 
<P>
"Blardy peasant!  Harsta la veesta!"

&gt;Subject: California Election<BR>
<P>
</PRE>On Letterman, 2003/09/08... 
<P>
"Today, citing the 'equal time' statue,  all 134 California 
Candidates for Governor demand to sleep with Maria Shriver" 
<P>

&gt;Subject: Recall Circus<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Like most Californians, I have been deluged with political mailings, 
telephone solicitations, and television commercials about the upcoming 
October 7th gubernatorial recall.  For and against.  Promoting this 
candidate or smearing that one.  And don't get me started on the heated, 
dogmatic arguments between my coworkers. 
<P>
Today I found out that a two week business trip I had scheduled had been 
pushed back and that I would instead be in town through the election.  I 
spent most of the morning in a dark mood, not really understanding why I 
felt so blue until it hit me. 
<P>
For two weeks now I have been hoping to run <B>away</B> from the circus.

&gt;Subject: Schwarzenegger wins: good news and bad news<BR>
<P>
</PRE>I have good news and bad news:  Arnold Schwarzenegger won the 
Governorship of California.  On the other hand, he won't be available 
to act in movies for a while. 
<P>
Now, which is the good news and which is the bad? 
<P>

&gt;Subject: Learning from California<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Democrats shouldn't complain about the election in California. 
They should learn from the experience and profit from the lesson. 
<P>
Do you think Bush will be hard to beat in 2004? 
Two words: President J-Lo.
