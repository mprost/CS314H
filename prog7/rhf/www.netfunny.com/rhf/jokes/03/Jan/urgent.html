<BR>URGENT ASSISTANCE - FROM USA<BR>
<P>
IMMEDIATE ATTENTION NEEDED :<BR>
HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL<BR>
<P>
FROM: GEORGE WALKER BUSH<BR>
202.456.1414 / 202.456.1111<BR>
FAX: 202.456.2461<BR>
<P>
DEAR SIR / MADAM,<BR>
<P>
I AM GEORGE WALKER BUSH, SON OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED<BR>
STATES OF AMERICA GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH, AND CURRENTLY SERVING AS<BR>
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  THIS LETTER MIGHT SURPRISE<BR>
YOU BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT MET NEITHER IN PERSON NOR BY CORRESPONDENCE.  I<BR>
CAME TO KNOW OF YOU IN MY SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE AND REPUTABLE PERSON TO<BR>
HANDLE A VERY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS TRANSACTION, WHICH INVOLVES THE<BR>
TRANSFER OF A HUGE SUM OF MONEY TO AN ACCOUNT REQUIRING MAXIMUM<BR>
CONFIDENCE.<BR>
<P>
I AM WRITING YOU IN ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE PRIMARILY TO SEEK YOUR<BR>
ASSISTANCE IN ACQUIRING OIL FUNDS THAT ARE PRESENTLY TRAPPED IN THE<BR>
REPUBLIC OF IRAQ.  MY PARTNERS AND I SOLICIT YOUR ASSISTANCE IN<BR>
COMPLETING A TRANSACTION BEGUN BY MY FATHER, WHO HAS LONG BEEN ACTIVELY<BR>
ENGAGED IN THE EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,<BR>
AND BRAVELY SERVED HIS COUNTRY AS DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED STATES CENTRAL<BR>
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.<BR>
<P>
IN THE DECADE OF THE NINETEEN-EIGHTIES, MY FATHER, THEN VICE-PRESIDENT<BR>
OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, SOUGHT TO WORK WITH THE GOOD OFFICES OF<BR>
THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ TO REGAIN LOST OIL REVENUE SOURCES<BR>
IN THE NEIGHBORING ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN.  THIS UNSUCCESSFUL VENTURE<BR>
WAS SOON FOLLOWED BY A FALLING-OUT WITH HIS IRAQI PARTNER, WHO SOUGHT TO<BR>
ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL OIL REVENUE SOURCES IN THE NEIGHBORING EMIRATE OF<BR>
KUWAIT, A WHOLLY-OWNED U.S.-BRITISH SUBSIDIARY.<BR>
<P>
MY FATHER RE-SECURED THE PETROLEUM ASSETS OF KUWAIT IN 1991 AT A COST OF<BR>
SIXTY-ONE BILLION U.S. DOLLARS ($61,000,000,000).  OUT OF THAT COST,<BR>
THIRTY-SIX BILLION DOLLARS ($36,000,000,000) WERE SUPPLIED BY HIS<BR>
PARTNERS IN THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER PERSIAN GULF<BR>
MONARCHIES, AND SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ($16,000,000,000) BY GERMAN AND<BR>
JAPANESE PARTNERS.  BUT MY FATHER'S FORMER IRAQI BUSINESS PARTNER<BR>
REMAINED IN CONTROL OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ AND ITS PETROLEUM<BR>
RESERVES.<BR>
<P>
MY FAMILY IS CALLING FOR YOUR URGENT ASSISTANCE IN FUNDING THE REMOVAL<BR>
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ AND ACQUIRING THE PETROLEUM<BR>
ASSETS OF HIS COUNTRY, AS COMPENSATION FOR THE COSTS OF REMOVING HIM<BR>
FROM POWER.  UNFORTUNATELY, OUR PARTNERS FROM 1991 ARE NOT WILLING TO<BR>
SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF THIS NEW VENTURE, WHICH IN ITS UPCOMING PHASE MAY<BR>
COST THE SUM OF 100 BILLION TO 200 BILLION DOLLARS ($100,000,000,000 -<BR>
$200,000,000,000), BOTH IN THE INITIAL ACQUISITION AND IN LONG-TERM<BR>
MANAGEMENT.<BR>
<P>
WITHOUT THE FUNDS FROM OUR 1991 PARTNERS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO<BR>
ACQUIRE THE OIL REVENUE TRAPPED WITHIN IRAQ.  THAT IS WHY MY FAMILY AND<BR>
OUR COLLEAGUES ARE URGENTLY SEEKING YOUR GRACIOUS ASSISTANCE.  OUR<BR>
DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUES IN THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION INCLUDE THE<BR>
SITTING VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RICHARD CHENEY,<BR>
WHO IS AN ORIGINAL PARTNER IN THE IRAQ VENTURE AND FORMER HEAD OF THE<BR>
HALLIBURTON OIL COMPANY, AND CONDOLEEZA RICE, WHOSE PROFESSIONAL<BR>
DEDICATION TO THE VENTURE WAS DEMONSTRATED IN THE NAMING OF A CHEVRON<BR>
OIL TANKER AFTER HER.<BR>
<P>
I WOULD BESEECH YOU TO TRANSFER A SUM EQUALING TEN TO TWENTY-FIVE<BR>
PERCENT (10-25 %) OF YOUR YEARLY INCOME TO OUR ACCOUNT TO AID IN THIS<BR>
IMPORTANT VENTURE.  THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES OF<BR>
AMERICA WILL FUNCTION AS OUR TRUSTED INTERMEDIARY.  I PROPOSE THAT YOU<BR>
MAKE THIS TRANSFER BEFORE THE FIFTEENTH (15TH) OF THE MONTH OF APRIL.<BR>
I KNOW THAT A TRANSACTION OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD MAKE ANYONE<BR>
APPREHENSIVE AND WORRIED.  BUT I AM ASSURING YOU THAT ALL WILL BE WELL<BR>
<P>
AT THE END OF THE DAY.  A BOLD STEP TAKEN SHALL NOT BE REGRETTED, I<BR>
ASSURE YOU.  PLEASE DO BE INFORMED THAT THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION IS<BR>
100% LEGAL.  IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO CO-OPERATE IN THIS TRANSACTION,<BR>
PLEASE CONTACT OUR INTERMEDIARY REPRESENTATIVES TO FURTHER DISCUSS THE<BR>
MATTER.<BR>
<P>
I PRAY THAT YOU UNDERSTAND OUR PLIGHT.  MY FAMILY AND OUR COLLEAGUES<BR>
WILL BE FOREVER GRATEFUL.  PLEASE REPLY IN STRICT CONFIDENCE TO THE<BR>
CONTACT NUMBERS BELOW.<BR>
<P>
SINCERELY WITH WARM REGARDS,<BR>
<P>
GEORGE WALKER BUSH<BR>
