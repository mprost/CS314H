</PRE>I have been guilty of looking at others my own age and thinking... 
surely I cannot look that old.........  I'm sure you've done the same.. 
<P>
You may enjoy this short story. While waiting for my first appointment 
in the reception room of a new dentist, I noticed his certificate, which 
bore his full name. Suddenly, I remembered that a tall, handsome boy 
with the same name had been in my high school class some 40 years ago. 
Upon seeing him, however, I quickly discarded any such thought. This 
balding, gray-haired man with the deeply lined face was too old to have 
been my classmate.  After he had examined my teeth, I asked him if he 
had attended the local high school.  "Yes," he replied. 
<P>
"When did you graduate?" I asked. 
<P>
He answered, "In 1957." 
<P>
"Why, you were in my class!" I exclaimed. 
<P>
He looked at me closely and then asked, "What did you teach?"
