</PRE>The wedding day was fast approaching. Everything was ready, and nothing 
could dampen Jennifer's excitement, not even her parents' nasty divorce. 
Her mother Sheila finally found the PERFECT dress to wear and would be 
the best dressed mother of the bride EVER! 
<P>
A week later, Jennifer was horrified to learn her new young stepmother, 
Barbie, had purchased the same dress. She asked Barbie to exchange the 
dress, but Barbie refused, "Absolutely not! I'm going to wear this dress; 
I'll look like a million in it!" 
<P>
Jennifer told her mother, who graciously replied, "Never mind dear. I'll get 
another dress, after all it's your special day, not hers." 
<P>
Two weeks later, another dress was finally found. When they stopped for 
lunch, Jennifer asked her mother, "What are you going to do with the first 
dress?  Maybe you should return it. You don't have any place to wear it." 
<P>
Sheila grinned and replied, "Of course, I do, dear! I'm wearing it to the 
rehearsal dinner!"
