</PRE>Three strangers at the Great Falls airport are awaiting their 
flights. One is a Native American on his way to Helena for a 
statewide pow-wow. 
<P>
Another, a ranch hand on his way to Billings for a stock show. 
<P>
The third passenger is a fundamentalist Arab student, newly 
arrived, and on his way to study engineering at Montana Tech. 
<P>
To pass the time they strike up a conversation on recent events, 
and the discussion drifts to their diverse cultures. 
<P>
Soon the westerners learn that the Arab is a devout radical 
Muslim, and believes his people are justified in their 'holy' 
war. 
<P>
The conversation falls into an uneasy lull. The cowpoke leans 
back in his chair, crosses his boots on a magazine table and 
tips his big sweat-stained hat forward over his face. 
<P>
The wind outside blows and blows and the old windsock flaps but 
no plane comes. 
<P>
Finally, the Native American clears his throat and softly he 
speaks:" Once, my people were many, now we are few." 
<P>
The radical Muslim raises an eyebrow and leans forward, "Once my 
people were few," he sneers, "and now we are many. Why do you 
suppose that is?" 
<P>
The Cowboy shifts the toothpick to one side of his mouth and 
from the darkness beneath his Stetson says, "That's 'cause we 
ain't played Cowboys and Muslims yet. 
<P>
