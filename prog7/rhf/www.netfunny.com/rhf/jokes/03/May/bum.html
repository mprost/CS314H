</PRE>A man was walking in the city, when he was accosted by a particularly dirty 
and shabby-looking bum who asked him for a couple of dollars for dinner. 
<P>
The man took out his wallet, extracted two dollars and asked, "If I gave 
you this money, will you take it and buy whiskey?" 
<P>
"No, I stopped drinking years ago," the bum said. 
<P>
"Will you use it to gamble?" 
<P>
"I don't gamble. I need everything I can get just to stay alive." 
<P>
"Will you spend the money on greens fees at a golf course?" 
<P>
"Are you NUTS! I haven't played golf in 20 years!" 
<P>
The man said, "Well, I'm not going to give you two dollars.  Instead, 
I'm going to take you to my home for a terrific dinner cooked by my wife." 
<P>
The bum was astounded.  "Won't your wife be furious with you for doing 
that?  I know I'm dirty, and I probably smell pretty bad." 
<P>
The man replied, "That's OK. I just want her to see what a man looks like 
who's given up drinking, gambling, and golf." 
<P>
