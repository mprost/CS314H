</PRE>A middle-aged woman decides to have a face-lift for her birthday. She 
spends $5000 and feels pretty good about the results. On her way home 
she stops at a newsstand to buy a newspaper. Before leaving she says to 
the clerk, "I hope you don't mind my asking, but how old do you think I am?" 
<P>
"About 32," was the reply. 
<P>
"I'm exactly 47, " the woman says happily. 
<P>
A little while later she goes into McDonald's and asks the counter girl 
"How old do you think I am?" "I guess about 29." The woman replies. 
<P>
"Nope, I'm 47." 
<P>
Now she's feeling really good about herself. She stops in a drugstore on 
her way down the street. She goes up to the counter to get some mints 
and asks the clerk this burning question. 
<P>
The clerk, "Oh, I'd say 30." 
<P>
Again she proudly responds, "I am 47, but thank you." 
<P>
While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man the same 
question. 
<P>
He replies, "Lady, I'm 78 and my eyesight is going. Although, when I was 
young, there was a sure way to tell how old a woman was. It sounds kind 
of forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra. 
Then I can tell you exactly how old you are." 
<P>
They waited in silence on the empty street until curiosity got the best 
of her. She finally blurts out, "What the hell, go ahead." 
<P>
He slips both of his hands under her blouse and under her bra and begins 
to feel around very slowly and carefully. After a couple of minutes of this 
she says, 
"Okay, okay, that's enough,.....how old am I?" 
<P>
He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands and says, 
"Madam, you are 47." 
<P>
Stunned and amazed, the woman says, "That was incredible,...how could you 
possibly know that from a feel of my breasts?" 
<P>
The old man replies, "I was behind you in line at McDonald's."
