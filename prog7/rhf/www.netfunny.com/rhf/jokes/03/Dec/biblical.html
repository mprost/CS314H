</PRE>Pete Snodgrass was famous throughout the South for his success as a criminal 
defense lawyer using biblical precedents for his defense. 
<P>
Appearing before a judge known for his biblical scholarship, Sneaky Pete (as 
he was called by the prosecutors) said, "Your honor, this is a victimless 
crime. My client swindled an insurance company. He has offered to make full 
restitution, so the insurance company will not suffer. He will pay all court 
costs, so the State will not suffer. He was immoral, but Christ died for his 
sins, so you can't put my client in jeopardy for a crime that has been 
punished already." 
<P>
The judge nodded. "You're right. Nobody will be hurt, financially. And 
you're also right--Christ died for his sins. But, in this case, he was an 
accessory. So, I'm giving him a choice. Biblical punishment--we nail him 
to the cross--or 6 months in jail." 
<P>
