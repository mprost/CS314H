</PRE>A woman walks into a pharmacy, strolls over to the counter, and catches 
the pharmacist's attention.  "Can I please get some arsenic?" she asks. 
<P>
"Arsenic?  What do you want arsenic for?" asks the pharmacist.  "It's for 
my husband," she replies. 
<P>
"You husband?" exclaims the pharmacist, "I hope you don't mean what I 
think you mean!"  She just nods.  "Well, lady," he replies, "I'm an honest 
man.  I can't sell you arsenic, I wouldn't if I could, and I don't know 
what made you think you could just stroll into a respectable store and 
expect me me to sell you arsenic.!" 
<P>
She doesn't say a word.  She just reaches into her purse, fishes out a 
photograph, and hands it across the counter.  It is a picture of her 
husband, in bed with the pharmacist's wife. 
<P>
Slowly the pharmacist looks up, over the counter, and then straight at 
her.  "Lady," he says, "why didn't you tell me you had a prescription?"
