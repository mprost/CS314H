</PRE>In ancient Greece (469 - 399 BC), Socrates was well known for his wisdom. 
One day the great philosopher came upon an acquaintance who said 
excitedly: "Socrates, do you know what I just heard about one of your 
students?" 
<P>
"Wait a moment," Socrates replied. "Before telling me anything I'd like 
you to pass a little test. It's called the Triple Filter Test." 
<P>
"Triple filter?" 
<P>
"That's right," Socrates continued "Before you talk to me about my 
student, it might be a good idea to take a moment and filter what 
you're going to say.  The first filter is Truth. Have you made 
absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?" 
<P>
"No," the man said, "actually I just heard about it and ...." 
<P>
"All right," said Socrates. "So you don't really know if it's true or not. 
<P>
Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Is what you are 
about to tell me about my student something good?" 
<P>
"No, on the contrary ..." 
<P>
"So," Socrates continued, "you want to tell me something bad about him, 
but you're not certain it's true. You may still pass the test though, 
because there's one filter left: the filter of Usefulness. Is what you 
want to tell me about my student going to be useful to me?" 
<P>
"No, not really." 
<P>
"Well," concluded Socrates, "if what you want to tell me is neither true 
nor good nor even useful, why tell it to me at all?" 
<P>
This is why Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem. 
<P>
It also explains why he never found out that Plato was banging his wife.
