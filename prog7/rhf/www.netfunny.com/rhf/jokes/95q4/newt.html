<PRE>
For those of you who don't follow US politics, the government was shut down
for several days earlier this month in part, according to Newt Gingrich,
Speaker of the House of Representatives, because he had been snubbed on Air
Force One while traveling to the Yitzhak Rabin funeral.

Since the current continuing resolution expires on December 15th, we could be
in for another shutdown. In preparation, I've put together the following list.


The top ten reasons why Newt will shut down the government again on Dec 15.

10. Clinton wouldn't validate his parking ticket the last time he visited the
White House.
9. The flight attendant on Air Force One made him pay $4 for headsets.
8. When Clinton asked for another continuing resolution, he forgot to say
"Mother may I?"
7. Clinton has a neat theme song that is played every time he enters the room
and he won't let Newt use it.
6. Al Gore slipped a Whoopee cushion in his seat at the Rabin funeral.
5. When Clinton answers the phone, he always says, "Ya sure that's you Newt?
Ya don't SOUND like a Georgia boy."
4. Chelsey keeps confusing him with Phil Donahue.
3. His heart is two sizes too small.
2. Hillary keeps trying to pinch his butt in public.
1. Somebody put him on the Grecian Formula mailing list, and Bob Dole says he
didn't do it.
