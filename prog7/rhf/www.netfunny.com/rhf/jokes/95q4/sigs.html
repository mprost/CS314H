</PRE>[Background: I posted this in December of 1993 to alt.fan.warlord, a 
newsgroup in which the point is to make fun of, or "warlord," bad 
.signature files (where "bad" means excessively long, containing a 
dumb quote or a silly picture, etc.).  I wrote it after a series of 
warlords containing poetry by me and others; it was perhaps intended 
to be the warlord poem to supersede all warlord poems.  It took me 
fourteen hours to write. 
<P>
In February 1995, it got posted to alt.humor.best-of-usenet 
unbeknownst to me.  It received quite a positive response, and I 
thought perhaps the wider rec.humor.funny audience would enjoy it too. 
It works well if you hear it as though read by James Earl Jones, just 
as he read "The Raven" in the "Simpsons" Hallowe'en episode from 1990. 
<P>
One final note: it somehow became decreed that all poetry warlords had 
to contain the rhyme "crass" with "ass" somewhere.  Stanza seven meets 
this requirement.]

all at once, with no forewarning--grievous hint of things in store.<BR>
Hardly had my reading started when I'd plumb'd the depths uncharted:<BR>
.sigs of taste long since departed, ravag'd into shreds by war.<BR>

Stomach rumblings begg'd the question, "Am I getting indigestion? 
 Urgent threat or mere suggestion?  Bah, I'll think on it no more." 
When, before my eyes unblinking, up this sign-off floated, stinking. 
 Lo, I felt my reason shrinking; worse, my innards, newly sore, 
 grumbl'd discontentedly--a sharper pain, unduly sore. 
'Twas the sign-off

"Ghastly .sigs, have they no ending?" ponder'd I, uncomprehending, 
 fateful pall of doom descending, feelings I could not ignore. 
Ere my future hopes had brighten'd, suddenly, discomfort heighten'd 
 when this sign-off, unenlighten'd, wretched, rotten to the core 
 flash'd before me.  Now felt I new pangs alarming in my core 
caus'd by this one:

Ent'ring next the comp. hi'rarchy, notic'd I this foul malarky. 
 "Stop!" I cri'd, for nought; my snarky brain, too quick, had thought, "Abhor!" 
Vision fading, gorge rebuking, to the bathroom ran I, puking, 
 spray'ng the technicolor'd goop in bilious blotches on the floor: 
 Rorschach ink-blot, Mr. Creosote-esque splotches on the floor.

As I lay there weakly moaning, breathing labor'd, stomach groaning, 
 to the Lord begg'd I condoning for these steaming chunks galore. 
"Lord," said I, "your wrath astounds me.  All this yak that now surrounds me 
 must be clean'd ere it confounds me; who is equal to the chore?" 
 "Who, indeed," the Lord responded.  "Dave's the one who'll do the chore." 
Quoth the Savior,

With relief was I reseated.  Then <I>this</I> double .sig I greeted! 
 Gastric retribution fleeted not: I sprinted for the door. 
Flash of lightning!  Crash of thunder!  Gobs of half-digested chunder 
 launch'd themselves in arcs asunder, port and starboard, aft and fore: 
 rainbow spectra luminescing, port and starboard, aft and fore.

All these putrid posters crass, they'd brought up piles of gurp en masse! Pray, 
 could I not denote them "ass"?  Nay!  Asses, rightly, I deplore. 
Blame you me for not suspecting lunch <I>again</I> I'd be rejecting? 
 Vomit riches flew, collecting, rend'ring me a pauper poor; 
 stir-fry heaving, wisdom leaving, health bereaving, left me poor.

Sadly, though, these .sigs conducive but to vomitus effusive 
 share a bandwidth less reclusive than most readers bargain for. 
Gentle Reader, be you wary; signatures like these ones scary 
 render treatment necessary; use your killfile, I implore! 
 Then, you'll spare yourself the care.  If you should do as I implore, 
may you prosper--evermore.
