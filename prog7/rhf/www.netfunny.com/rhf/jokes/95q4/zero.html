It seems that a young man volunterred for military service during 
World War II. He had such a high aptitude for aviation that he was sent 
right to Pensecola skipping boot camp. 
<P>
The very first day at Pensecola he solos and is the best flier on 
the base. All they could do was give him his gold wings and assign him 
immediately to an aircraft carrier in the Pacific. 
<P>
On his first day aboard he took off and single-handedly shot down 
6 Japanese Zeroes. Then climbing up to 20,000 ft. he found 9 more Japanese 
planes and shot them all down, too. 
<P>
Noting that his fuel was getting low, he descended, circled the 
carrier and came in for a perfect landing on the deck. He threw back the 
canopy, climbed out and jogged over to the captain. Saluting smartly he 
said, "Well sir, how did I do on my very first day?" 
<P>
The captain replied, "You make one velly impoltant mistake!"
