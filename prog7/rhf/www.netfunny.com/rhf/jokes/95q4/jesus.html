If you have half a brain, you can't help but notice the throng of 
publications, analists and net users declaring Windows 95 the 
Saviour of the Computer Industry.  If you have less than half a 
brain, you probably believe it.  Could it be? 
<P>
Let's compare Windows 95 against a widely-accepted Saviour, Jesus 
of Nazareth:

<PRE>        Jesus                                   Windows 95

Bible says, "In Him, all things are   |  Windows 95 doesn't even 
possible."                               run all possible Windows 
                                         apps.

the multitudes                           performance barely works.

Jesus has no sin.                     |  Windows 95 has no shame.
