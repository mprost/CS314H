An original of mine. 
<P>
A business man is packing for a trip.  He glances in his 
briefcase, then calls to his wife. 
<P>
"Honey." 
<P>
"Yes, darling?" she replies. 
<P>
"Honey," he says, in mild exasperation, "why do you persist 
in putting a condom in my briefcase every time I go on a trip? 
You know I only have eyes for you. I'd never be unfaithful." 
<P>
"Oh, I know, darling, and I trust you," she replies sweetly, 
"It's just that, well you know, with all those terrible diseases 
out there, it would make me feel better to know that if anything 
did happen, you'd be protected. So please, darling, take it with 
you, won't you?  For my sake?" 
<P>
"Oh, alright, if you put it that way," he relented, "I'll do 
it for you.  But for heaven's sake, give me more than ONE!" 
<P>
