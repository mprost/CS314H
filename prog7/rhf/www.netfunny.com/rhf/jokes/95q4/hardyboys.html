                       THE HARDY BOYS DRINKING GAME
                      by  Brian Sebby, data@imsa.edu
                        Last update: Oct. 19, 1995

This is like all the other drinking games on the net, except that you drink
while reading, instead of watching the TV.  For this game, you can choose
whatever you'd like to drink, although with the subject matter being what
it is, I'd recommend Kool-Ade. :)

This file was inspired by discussions between me and my roommates about random
weird things we remembered from the Hardy Boys.

Other people have given me ideas for this list.  If I did not come up with one
of the lines, I have attributed it to the person who thought of it.

I don't know if any of this is applicable to Nancy Drew, but you can try! :)

And so it begins...


Drink every time their father is offered a case, and he lets Frank and Joe
investigate it.

Drink every time the Hardy Boys suddenly decide to fly somewhere, and don't seem
to need any money.

Drink every time someone says something to the effect of "Oh, you're Fenton's
boys!" and gives them access they couldn't get access to otherwise.

Drink every time something way to convienient occurs to help them investigate
the case.  (e.g. They're investigating a fire department, and there's a fire
engine factory just outside of town.)

Drink every time Frank and Joe get access to new or experimental technology.

Drink every time one of the Hardy Boy's friends gets kidnapped.
   Drink twice if it's Chet Morton.

Drink every time money is mentioned or used, and it isn't directly related to
the main plot of the story.  (Sorry, this'll never happen.)

Drink every time something completely impossible happens.  (e.g. Frank and Joe
pilot the Space Shuttle.)

Drink every time a ghost or supernatural force is revealed to be a criminal
plot.

Drink every time the bad guys do something completely stupid.

Drink every time Frank and Joe go to school.  (Again, it'll never happen.)

Drink every time Frank and Joe find a secret passage.

Drink every time the Hardys meet Nancy Drew.

Drink every time Frank finds Joe unconcious, and vice-versa.

Drink every time Joe gets in a fight.

Drink every time the Hardys recieve a clue in the form of a puzzle.
   Drink twice if it's the chapter's cliffhanger.

Drink every time someone mentioned that they had worked with their father when
he was on the New York Police Force.

Drink every time one of the Hardy boys acts like Mr. Spock by knowing obscure
or helpful knowledge that JUST HAPPENS to relate to the story at hand. (e.g.
they go to Germany, and speak perfect German.)
   Drink twice if it's Frank.

Drink every time someone is hypnotized or brainwashed.

Drink every time the Hardy Boys leave the continent (16 and 17, mind you)
without any form of a legal or appointed gaurdian.

Drink every time the Hardy Boys violate curfew (In most states, 12:00
midnight).
		-Dan Brown, chronos@imsa.edu

Drink every time Frank and Joe run into some Law enforcement angent that
doesn't care who their father is, and ends up apologizing at the end of the
case.
   Drink twice if it is a sherif.
		-Dan Brown, chronos@imsa.edu

And finally...
Drink everytime the bad guys attack with chloroform instead of guns.
