<PRE>A pastor was visiting an elderly lady who was a "shut in."  Since she didn't
get very many visitors, she went on incessantly about her problems while the
pastor nibbled on some peanuts on the coffee table in front of him.  After
about a half hour, and with his endurance almost expended, he politely
interrupted, explaining that he had other appointments that afternoon and
said, "I'm afraid I've eaten most of your peanuts while I was listening and I
would like to leave you a couple of dollars so that you can get some more."

"No," replied the woman, "With my dentures I can't chew them.  It's all I can
do just to suck the chocolate off them."
