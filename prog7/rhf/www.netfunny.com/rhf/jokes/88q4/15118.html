Best when told with a heavy Italian accent when the father speaks. 
<P>
An Italian boy has a life long dream to go to school in the United 
States and it finally comes true (good thing for this joke) when he is 
accepted to Columbia University in New York.  After a couple of years 
at school his father comes to visit him in America. 
<P>
The boy is 
very excited to see his father and ask what he would like to do in 
America.  The father says, "This is'a America. I'd a like'a to go'a to 
a baseball game." 
<P>
So they head on down to Yankee stadium and as it 
turns out it's oldtimers day.  Roger Maris comes to bat and hits a 
long ball which is heading for the left field seats.  The father stands 
up and yells, "RUN'A ROGER, RUN." 
<P>
Micky Mantle comes up next and hits 
a fly ball to deep right field.  Again, the father stands up, and yells 
"RUN'A MICKEY, RUN." 
<P>
Next Joe Dimagio steps out to the plate.  There 
pitcher throws ball one, ball two, ball three and walks him on four 
pitches.  As Joe Dimagio starts to trot to first base the father stands 
up and shouts, "RUN'A JOE, RUN." 
<P>
"No," his son interrupts, "He has four balls, he walks." 
<P>
His father stands up again, "walk'a proud, Joe, walk'a proud."
