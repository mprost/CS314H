   An American, a Frenchman, and a Vietnamese refugee had a discussion about
the happiness of life.  
   "To me, happiness is returning home on a Monday evening, having a wonderful 
dinner prepared by my wife, then slouching on the sofa watching Monday Night
Football," the American said.
   "You Americans are not romantic at all", the French injected, "Spending a
lovely evening with my lover, walking along the Seine river, and having a
romantic dinner on top of the Eiffel tower.  That is happiness of life."
   "You call those things happiness", the Vietnamese said, "then you two still
don't understand life at all.  Imagine this.  You are sleeping soundly at 
night in Saigon.  Then suddenly you hear loud knocks on your front door.  You 
hear loud voices, 'Mr. Nguyen Van Binh, open the door!'.  Awaked with fear, 
you rush out and open the door.  Right there, you see two secret policemen 
ready to handcuff you.  One man say to you, 'Mr. Nguyen Van Binh, you are 
under arrest for your anti-revolutionary activities.  You are being sent to 
the re-educational camp for an undetermined period of time.  Sweating profusely
and shaking uncontrollably, you reply to them, 'Comrades, Mr. Nguyen Van Binh 
lives next door.'  That moment is the ultimate happiness of life, my friends."
