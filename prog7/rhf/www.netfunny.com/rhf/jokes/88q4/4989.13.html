So there are three golfers, (Bob, Max, and Ted) who are looking for a 
fourth. Bob mentions that his friend George is a pretty good golfer, so 
they decide to invite him for the following Saturday. 
<P>
"Sure, I'd love to play," says George, "but I may be about ten minutes 
late, so wait for me." 
<P>
So Saturday rolls around. Bob, Max, and Ted arrive promptly at 9:00, 
and find George already waiting for them. He plays right-handed, and 
beats them all. Quite pleased with their new fourth, they ask him if 
he'd like to play again the following Saturday. 
<P>
"Yeah, sounds great," says George. "But I may be about ten minutes 
late, so wait for me." 
<P>
The following Saturday, again, all four golfers show up on time, but 
this time George plays left-handed, and beats them all. As they're 
getting ready to leave, George says: 
<P>
"See you next Saturday. But I may be about ten minutes late, so wait 
for me." 
<P>
Every week, George is right on time, and plays great with whichever 
hand he decides to use. And every week, he departs with the same 
message. 
<P>
After a couple months, Ted is pretty tired of this routine, so he 
says, "Wait a minute, George. Every week you say you may be about ten 
minutes late, but you're right on time. And you beat us either 
left-handed or right-handed. What's the story?" 
<P>
"Well," George says, "I'm kind of superstitious. When I get up in the 
morning, I look at my wife. If she's sleeping on her left side, I play 
left-handed. And if she's sleeping on her right side, I play 
right-handed." 
<P>
"So what do you do if she's sleeping on her back?" Bob asks. 
<P>
"Then I'm about ten minutes late," George answers.
