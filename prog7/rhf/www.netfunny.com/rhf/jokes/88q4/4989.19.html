<H4>I Have Noticed</H4>
<P>
Everything is farther away than it used to be.  It is even twice as far to 
the corner and they have added a hill.  I have given up running for the 
bus; it leaves earlier than it used to. 
It seems to me they are making the stairs steeper than in the old 
days.  And have you noticed the smaller print they use in the newspapers? 
There is no sense in asking anyone to read aloud anymore, as 
everybody speaks in such a low voice I can hardly hear them. 
The material in dresses is so skimpy now, especially around the 
hips and waist, that it is almost impossible to reach one's shoelaces. 
And the sizes don't run the way they used to.  The 12's and 14's are so 
much smaller. 
Even people are changing.  They are so much younger than they used 
to be when I was their age.  On  the other hand people my age are so much 
older than I am. 
I ran into an old classmate the other day and she has aged so much 
that she didn't recognize me. 
I got to thinking about the poor dear while I was combing my hair 
this morning and in so doing I glanced at my own reflection.  Really 
now, they don't even make good mirrors like they used to.
