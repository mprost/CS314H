<PRE>Two hunters hire a small plane to take them to a remote area of Canada.
Upon dropping off the hunters, the pilot tells them, "Remember only one
moose, because the plane wouldn't be able to take off with more weight
than that."  The hunters go off.  A week later when the plane returns to
pick them up the two hunters are standing by the lake with two moose.

The pilot fumes, "I told you guys only one moose, you'll have to leave one
because we won't be able to take off with that much weight."  "Oh, c'mon,"
beg the two hunters, "Last year the pilot let us take two moose on, you're
just a chicken."

Not wanting to be accused of being a coward, the pilot allows the two to
bring both moose on the craft.  The plane starts across the lake,
straining to take off.  The pilot tries and tries to no avail as
they run out of room and the plane crashes into the trees at the end of the
lake.  A while later after coming to one of the hunters gets up and looks
at all the scatterd debris of the wreck and says, "Where are we?"  To which
the other hunter replies, "Oh, I'd say about a hundred yards farther than
last year."
