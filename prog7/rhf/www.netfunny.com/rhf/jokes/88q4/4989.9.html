<PRE>
	A ventriloquist in a nightclub is telling a series of [ethnic]
jokes.  He plays straight man while the little dummy on his knee poses
the riddles and answers questions.  After many of these, a doddering
old man gets up from his chair and shouts, "Will you just knock it off!"
Everyone in the room turns to look and the ventriloquist stops.  "I'm
just sick and tired of all these idiodic [ethnic] jokes that try to
make [ethnic]s look so stupid!  'How many [ethnics] does it take to
screw in a lightbulb?'...  'There was an Italian, a Jew and an [ethnic]...'
and so on!  Well just stop it, because we [ethnics] proud of our
heritage, our contribution to civilization and the great intellects
we have produced!"  The club is silent as the old man sits down
angrily.  Finally, the ventriloquist, in a conciliatory tone, says,
"Sir, I am really sorry to cause such an offense.  I really didn't 
intend to hurt anybody's feelings at all.  I just want everyone to
have a nice time and enjoy themselves, and the last thing I want
to do is make someone upset.  Would you accept my apology?"
The old man gets up suddenly and exclaims, "It's not <b>you</b> I'm
talking to, you fool, it's that little bastard on your knee!!"
