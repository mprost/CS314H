This joke was told to me this past weekend by Estil Vance, who probably 
heard it from someone at Johns Hopkins Medical School. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
A ventriloquist was driving through the midwest when his car broke down. 
He walked a ways and found a farmer who would let him use his phone.  Well, 
the farmer seemed to be a real stereotypical rural type, so the ventriloquist 
thought it would be possible to have some fun with him.  The farmer began 
to lead him back to the house. 
<P>
Along the way, they passed a horse.  The ventriloquist said to the farmer, 
"Is this your horse?"  The farmer replied, "Yep."  The ventriloquist asked, 
"Can he talk?"  The farmer said, "Nope."  The ventriloquist then said to the 
horse, "So, how do you like it here?"  He then threw his voice, and said in 
a horse-like voice, "Oh, it's pretty good.  Every morning the farmer feeds me 
oats."  Upon hearing this the farmer was startled and quickened his pace. 
<P>
Soon they came to a cow.  The ventriloquist asked, "Is this your cow?" and 
the farmer replied, "Yep."  He then asked, "Does it talk?" and the farmer 
replied, "I..I don't think so."  The ventriloquist asked the cow, "How do you 
like it here?" and threw his voice again.  In a cow-like voice, he said, 
"Oh, I like it just fine.  Every morning the farmer comes and milks me." 
Upon hearing this, the farmer squirmed.  He looked down at the ground and 
continued walking. 
<P>
Soon they came to some sheep.  The ventriloquist asked, "Are these your 
sheep?"  and the farmer replied, "Yep."  He then asked, "Do they talk?" and 
the farmer exclaimed, "Yes, but they lie!"
