This is a case of law found in a West Law digest.  This is an actual 
case heard by the Michigan court of appeals (Fisher v. Low, 333 N.W.2d 67) 
that was recently shown to me by somebody at school (after a long time 
being a software engineer I started evening law school).  I thought 
it was funny...you be the judge. 
<P>
<CENTER>Court of Appeals of Michigan</CENTER><BR>
<P>
<CENTER>Docket No. 60732</CENTER><BR>
<P>
<BR>A wayward Chevy struck a tree<BR>
whose owner sued defendants three.<BR>
He sued car's owner, driver too,<BR>
and insurer for what was his due.<BR>
For his oak tree that now may bear<BR>
a lasting need for tender care.<BR>
the Oakland County Circuit court,<BR>
John O' Brian, J., set forth<BR>
the judgment the defendants sought<BR>
and quickly an appeal was brought.<BR>
<P>
<BR>
Court of appeals, J.H.Gillis, J.<BR>
Gave thought to this and had this to say:<BR>
1) There is no liability<BR>
since no-fault grants immunity;<BR>
2) No jurisdiction can be found<BR>
where process service is unsound;<BR>
and thus the judgment, as it's termed<BR>
is due to be and is<BR>
Affirmed.<BR>
<P>
<BR>
Reason summaries (Squibbs)<BR>
1.<BR>
Defendant's Chevy struck a tree-<BR>
there was no liability;<BR>
the No-Fault Act comes into play<BR>
as owner and the driver say.<BR>
barred by the act's immunity<BR>
no suit in tort will aid the tree.<BR>
Although the oak's in disarray<BR>
No court can make defendants pay.<BR>
<P>
<BR>
2.<BR>
No jurisdiction could be found<BR>
where process service was unsound;<BR>
In personam jurisdiction<BR>
was not even legal fiction.<BR>
Where plaintiff failed to well comply<BR>
with rules of court that did apply.<BR>
<P>
<BR>
Summary of appeal court's opinion<BR>
J.H. Gillis, Judge<BR>
We thought that we would never see<BR>
a suit to compensate a tree.<BR>
A suit whose claim in tort is prest<BR>
upon a mangled tree's behest.<BR>
A tree whose battered trunk was prest<BR>
against a Chevy's crumpled crest.<BR>
A tree that faces each new day<BR>
with bark and limb in disarray.<BR>
A tree that may forever bear<BR>
a lasting need for tender care.<BR>
Flora lovers though we three,<BR>
we must uphold the court's decree.<BR>
<P>
<BR>
Affirmed.<BR>
