After several years of marriage, Debbie's husband, Mike, died 
suddenly.  According to his wishes, Debbie had his body cremated and 
placed the remains in a small urn. 
<P>
Several weeks later, Debbie came home wearing a full-length mink 
coat and an eight-carat diamond ring.  She went into the living room, 
removed the urn from the mantel and carefully tapped Mike's ashes into 
a small dish on the coffee table. 
<P>
"Mike, my beloved Mike," she began, "I wish to talk to you.  Mike, 
do you remember, for several years you promised me a mink coat?  Well, 
here it is, Mike.  Do you like it? 
<P>
"And, Mike," she continued, "do you remember, for several years 
you promised me a diamond ring? Yes?  You remember?  Here it is, Mike. 
Do you like it? 
<P>
"Well," Debbie exclaimed, puffing Mike's ashes into the air, 
"there's that blow job I was promising you." 
<P>
