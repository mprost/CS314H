An American tourist was riding in a taxi in Israel.  As the 
taxi approached a red light, the tourist was shocked to see 
the driver drive straight through without even slowing down. 
<P>
Surprised as he was, he didn't say anything, feeling himself 
a "guest" and not wanting to make waves. The trip continued 
without event until the next intersection. This time the 
light was green and, to the American's dismay, the cab driver 
brought the vehicle to a grinding halt.  Unable to contain 
his astonishment, he turns to the driver: 
<P>
"Listen," he says, "when you went through the red light, I 
didn't say anything. But, why, in heaven's name, are you 
stopping at a green light?!" 
<P>
The Israeli driver looks at him as if the American was 
deranged: 
<P>
"Are you crazy?!" he shouts. "The other guy has a red 
light--do you want to get us killed?!" 
<P>
