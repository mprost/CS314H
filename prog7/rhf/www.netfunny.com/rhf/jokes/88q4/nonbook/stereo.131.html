(I hope these aren't too offensive.  Perhaps they should be encrypted?) 
<P>
(1) A person belonging to an ethnic group whose members are commonly 
considered to have certain stereotypical mannerisms met another 
person belonging to a different ethnic group with a different set 
of imputed stereotypical mannerisms.  The first person acted in 
a manner consistent with the stereotypes associated with his ethnic 
group, and proceeded to make a remark which might be considered 
to establish conclusively his membership in that group, whereupon his 
companion proceeded to make a remark with a double meaning, the first 
meaning of which could be interpreted to indicate his agreement with 
his companion, but the other meaning of which serves to corroborate his 
membership in his particular ethnic group.  The first person took 
offense at his remark, and reacted in a stereotypical way! 
<P>
(2) Q:  How many people belonging to a certain ethnic group does it take 
to perform a particular menial activity? 
<P>
A:  A finite positive integer.  One to perform the activity, and the 
rest to behave in a manner stereotypical of their ethnic group! 
<P>
