A nice young worker from Australia Post ( yes they do exist ), was sorting 
through her regular envelopes, when she discovered a letter addressed as 
follows: 
<P>
<PRE>         GOD 
	 c/o Heaven 
</PRE><P>
</PRE>Upon opening the envelope, a letter enclosed told of how a little old 
lady who had never asked for anything in her life, was desperately in need of 
$100 and was wondering if God could send her the money. 
<P>
Well the young lady was deeply touched and made a collection from her 
fellow workmates and collected $90 and sent it off to the old lady.  A few 
weeks later another letter arrived addressed to God, so the young lady opened 
it and it read "Thank you for the money, God, I deeply appreciate it, however 
I only received $90.  It must have been those bastards at the Post Office." 
<P>
</PRE>
