(This joke was told to me by a high-ranking member of the UK 
government who said that he had heard it as a typical Hungarian joke. 
Interestingly, he said that the Hungarian sense of humor was the 
closest to the English of any of the Europeans.) 
<P>
A woman went to her psychiatrist because she was having severe 
problems with her sex life.  The psychiatrist asked her many questions 
but did not seem to be getting a clear picture of her problems. 
Finally he asked, "Do you ever watch your husband's face while you are 
having sex?" 
<P>
"Well, yes, I did once." 
<P>
"Well, how did he look?" 
<P>
"Very angry." 
<P>
At this point the psychiatrist felt that he was really getting 
somewhere and he said, "Well that's very interesting, we must look 
into this further.  Now tell me, you say that you have only seen your 
husband's face once during sex; that seems somewhat unusual; how did 
it occur that you saw his face that time?" 
<P>
"He was looking through the window."
