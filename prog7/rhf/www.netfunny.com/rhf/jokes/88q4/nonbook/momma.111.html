<STRONG>[Ed: A "JEDR" (pronounced "Jedder") is a generic member of a lampooned 
identifiable group.  It stands for "Joke Ethnic/Denomination/Race" and 
can refer to members of any such group, and others. This acronym does 
not refer to any specific person or group. ]</STRONG> 
<P>
Well, a young JEDR woman got married, you see, and as is traditional 
with JEDR custom, she was a virgin and knew nothing of the ways of 
Luv. 
<P>
On her wedding night, she ran downstairs to her mother and cried, 
"Momma, momma, what do I do?" 
<P>
Her mother replied, "Don't you worry, girl. Just lie back and enjoy 
yourself." 
<P>
So the girl went back upstairs to where her husband was waiting. 
When she entered the room, she found that he'd removed his shirt, 
and his arms and chest were very broad, and very hairy. 
<P>
She ran screaming back down the stairs. 
"Momma, momma," she cried. "He's gotta BIG HAIRY CHEST!" 
<P>
Her mother calmly replied, "Don't you worry, girl. He's gotta a 
big hairy chest, that just mean he gotta BIIIIG love muscle. You 
go back uppa there and have a good time." 
<P>
So back up the stairs she went. This time, when she entered the room, 
her husband had removed his trousers, and she saw his strong, muscled, 
hairy legs. 
<P>
She ran screaming back down the stairs. 
"Momma, momma," she cried. "He's gotta THICK HAIRY LEGS!!" 
<P>
Her mother calmly replied, "Don't you worry, girl. He's gotta 
thick hairy legs, that just mean he gotta LARGE junket pump. You 
go back uppa there and lie down and enjoy yourself." 
<P>
So back up she goes. As she enters the room, she sees his feet for 
the first time--and one of them is half missing! 
<P>
She ran screaming back down the stairs. 
"Momma, momma," she cried. "He's gotta FOOT AND A HALF!!" 
<P>
Her mother rushed upstairs with the words, "Outa my way, girl. 
This is a job for your momma!" 
<P>
(Told to me by my girlfriend, who was told by a young JEDR girl.)
