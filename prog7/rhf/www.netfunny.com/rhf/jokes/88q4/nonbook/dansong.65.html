<PRE>Don't know much about history 
Don't know much foreign policy 
Don't remember how I got through school 
I'm sure I didn't break the rules 
But what's it matter 'cause my granny says 
"Boy, if you want to you can be vice prez 
And what a wonderful world this will be" 
<P>
Don't know much about the women's vote 
Don't know much about the bill I wrote 
Don't know much about the foreign vets 
I've never voted for 'em yet 
But I do know if your dad tries hard 
He can get you in the National Guard 
And what a wonderful place that can be 
<P>
Now I never claimed to be an A student 
But what's wrong with C's? 
And maybe by knowing the names of my cabinet 
I can win their love for me 
<P>
Don't know much about air pollution 
Don't know much about the constitution 
Don't know much about th'economy 
It never much affected me 
But there's one thing that I know for sure 
If the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor 
What a wonderful world this will be 
<P>
Don't know much about the national debt 
I've never had to pay one yet 
If we need to we can sell the States 
To the Japanese at discount rates 
But I do know if things get bad 
George and I can always call my dad 
And what a wonderful world this will be... 
<P>
