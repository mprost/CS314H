<PRE>It  was the wedding night for a young couple and the groom wanted everything
to be just perfect.  He arranged to stay in the Honeymoon Suite of a plush
hotel, and he and his new bride eagerly jumped into the heart-shaped bed
to make love for the first time (at least for him).  After making wild and
passionate love for a considerate length of time, they both reached the
climactic momement simultaneously, slipping into a state of utmost
relaxation.  At this point, the groom reaches for the telephone.

"What on earth do you think you are doing?" asks the young bride

"Well, I wanted everything to be perfect, so I thought I should call room
service for a bottle of their finest champagne," came the reply

"Well, I used to date Arnold Palmer, and when Arnold and I finished making love
we would wait 10 minutes and make love again," the young groom was informed.

"If that's what you are used to, I will  be glad to comply..."  And 10 minutes
or so later the young couple was making wild and passionate love again.  At
the culmination of this second lovemaking session,  the young groom reaches
for the phone once again...

"What on earth do you think you are doing?"  asks the young bride.

"Like I said before, I want this to be a special occasion, so I was going to
call room service for that bottle of champagne."

"Well, Arnold and I used to relax for 15 minutes or so, and then make love a
third time,"  came her reply.

So, once again, not wanting to disappoint  his young bride, the groom relaxed
a bit and finally was capable of making love a third time.  After this third
wild and passionate and somewhat time consuming session, the couple finally
reaches the climactic momement and returns to a relaxed state.  Once again,
the groom reaches for the phone....

"What on earth do you think you are doing?"  asks the young bride.

"Calling Arnold Palmer to find out what's par for this hole!"
