<PRE>Four Oxford professors (dons, whatever...) were taking their evening walk
together and as usual, were engaged in casual but learned conversation.
On this particular evening, their conversation was about the names given
to groups of animals, such as a "pride of lions" or a "gaggle of geese."

One of the professors noticed a group of prostitutes down the block, and
posed the question, "What name would be given to that group?"  The four
fell into silence for a moment, as they pondered the possibilities...

At last, one spoke: "How about 'a Jam of Tarts'?"  The others nodded in
acknowledgement as they continued to consider the problem.  A second
professor spoke: "I'd suggest 'an Essay of Trollops.'"  Again, the
others nodded.  A third spoke: "I propose 'a Flourish of Strumpets.'"

They continued their walk in silence, until the first professor remarked
to the remaining professor, who was the most senior and learned of the
four, "You haven't suggested a name for our ladies.  What are your thoughts?"
The fourth professor replied, "'An Anthology of Prose.'"
