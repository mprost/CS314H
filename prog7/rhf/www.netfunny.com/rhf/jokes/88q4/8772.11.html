<PRE>
A fellow went to work one day and was met at the door by his boss. "You're
fired, and there may be a summons for your arrest out of this!" the boss
exclaimed.

The fellow then started to drive home when the steering went out
on his car and he ran into a carload of nuns. After the policeman let him
go with the collection of tickets, he called his insurance company, only to
find out that his wife forgot to send in the premium payment and that his
insurance ran out last week.

On his way home, he stopped into the bank to get some money and found
out that his wife had been there earlier with his best friend and
emptied the accounts. After leaving the bank, he was on his way home and
saw the fire engines heading down his street. Upon arriving
at his house, he discovered that it was indeed his house on fire. The fire 
chief was sure that it was going to be a total loss. Again, calling the 
insurance company, he found that the homeowners insurance also had been 
cancelled.

By now the fellow was somewhat depressed and went into the local
bar. As he was telling his troubles to the bartender the bartender said,
"You've got the chance of a lifetime. All your obligations are gone and you
can start all over. Why don't you take this bucket, go up to Huckleberry Hill,
pick huckleberries, and go door to door selling them."

Well, this sounded O.K. to the fellow, so off he went. After picking
most of the day he finally had enough berries to sell. At the first house he 
stopped at the woman said that she would indeed take all his huckleberries
but would he mind coming around to the back door. As the fellow got to the 
back door the woman opened it and was totally nude. (and not hard on the eyes)

The fellow just broke down and was weeping hysterically. The woman was quite
beside herself and asked what the problem was. The fellow answered "I've lost
my job, my car is ruined, my wife ran off with my best friend taking all my
money, my house burned down, all my insurance has been cancelled, and now
I'm going to be screwed out of my huckleberries."
