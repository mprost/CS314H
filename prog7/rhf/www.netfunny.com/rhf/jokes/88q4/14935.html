Sirs,<BR>
<P>
</PRE>I've decided to apply for your position as a systems 
programmer even though I hate snow worse than I hate snakes. 
<P>
I've been training for going on two years now at a local 
community college in data processing, computers, and that sort of 
stuff and have probably learned all about MVS/SP, JES2, ACF/VTAM, 
NCP, CICS, IDMS and a bunch of other letters you didn't even list 
(In fact, there's about 26 of them total)! 
<P>
I feel that this qualifies me in that respect.  As for IBM 
systems, I have an IBM Selectric and even an IBM wall clock at 
which my current boss says I watch better than anyone else here. 
You list Assembly but that seems like a typo to me because that 
is a hardware thing, nothing real programmers are supposed to do. 
However, if you will train me I will even buy my own tools 
provided you don't let any other real programmers see me doing 
it. 
<P>
I see that you list competitive salary but if the best you 
can do is to compete with my current salary I don't think I can 
afford the job.  I thought programmers made lots of money.  But 
I'm easy.  We can talk about that later. 
<P>
Please note that I've included my phone number and address 
but if you like you can just have my ticket waiting at the 
airport if that's more convenient.  Alaska Airlines first class 
will be good enough. 
<P>
By the way, just what does a systems programmer do?  (You can 
save that for the interview if you like.) 
<P>
I'm glad to see you're an equal opportunity employer.  My 
boss says you would need to be to hire an "obnoxious bastard" 
like me.  Is that a protected group? 
<P>
Well, act quick 'cause I'm going fast. 
<P>
Sincerely, 
<P>
