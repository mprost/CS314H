A rabbit and a snake, both blind from birth, happen to meet in the forest 
one day. They get to talking and the rabbit asks the snake, "Would you 
mind running your hands (not knowing what a snake looks like) over my body 
and telling me what kind of an animal I am? I'm too embarrassed to ask my 
near-sighted friends because I'm afraid they'll make fun of me." 
<P>
The snake says, "Okay," and proceeds to wind himself around the rabbit from 
one end to the other, then back again. "Well," the snake says, "You're 
kind of warm with real soft fur and you have two very long, fury ears." 
<P>
The rabbit thinks about that for a moment and then exclaims, "W O W! I 
must be a bunny!" and he hops around and hops around and starts hopping 
away. 
<P>
"Wait!" shouts the snake, "What about me? Come back here and do the same 
thing for me!" 
<P>
The rabbit hops over and with his fury little paws, pats the snake from 
one end to the other and then back again. He sits down without saying a 
word. 
<P>
"Well?" asks the snake, "What kind of animal an I?" 
<P>
"I'm not really sure," says the rabbit. "You're kind of cold and slimy, 
and for the life of me, I can't tell your head from your ass." 
<P>
The snake thinks and thinks about this, then exclaims, "W O W! I must 
be an attorney!" 
<P>
