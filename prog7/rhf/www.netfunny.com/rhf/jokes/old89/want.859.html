Heard this one from a friend: 
<P>
It seems that a little girl and and a little boy are arguing 
about differences between the sexes, he arguing that boys are 
inherently better and she that girls are.  The subject, of course, 
spills over into the personal realm, so that the real issue is which 
of the two children is superior.  Finally, the boy drops his pants and 
says, "Here's something I have that you'll never have!" 
<P>
The little girl is pretty upset by this, since it is quite clearly 
true.  She turns and runs home. 
<P>
A while later, she comes running back with a smile on her face. 
She drops <I>her</I> pants, and says, "My mommy says that with one of these, 
I can have as many of those as I want!" 
<P>
