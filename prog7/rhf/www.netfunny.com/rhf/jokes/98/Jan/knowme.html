</PRE>A small town prosecuting attorney called his first witness to the 
stand in a trial--a grandmotherly, elderly woman. He approached her 
and asked, "Mrs. Jones, do you know me?" 
<P>
She responded, "Why, yes, I do know you Mr. Williams. I've known 
you since you were a young boy. And frankly, you've been a big 
disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, you manipulate 
people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a 
rising big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you never will 
amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know 
you." 
<P>
The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do he pointed across 
the room and asked, "Mrs. Williams, do you know the defense attorney?" 
<P>
She again replied, "Why, yes I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was 
a youngster, too. I used to babysit him for his parents. And 
he, too, has been a real disappointment to me. He's lazy, bigoted, he 
has a drinking problem. The man can't build a normal relationship 
with anyone and his law practice is one of the shoddiest in the 
entire state. Yes, I know him." 
<P>
At this point, the judge rapped the courtroom to silence and called 
both counselors to the bench. In a very quiet voice, he said with 
menace, "If either of you asks her if she knows me, you'll be jailed 
for contempt!" 
<P>
