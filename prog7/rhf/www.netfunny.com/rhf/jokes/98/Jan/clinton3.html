</PRE>More Forni-gate jokes...  These are jokes which are funny, but which didn't 
really warrant posting separately.  I post such a digest whenever I have 
enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly selective readers will probably 
not enjoy the digests, and may want to killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in 
the title - ed. 
<P>

&gt;From: yang444@pacbell.net<BR>
&gt;Subject: Clinton's charades + Mike McCurry<BR>
<P>
</PRE>News item: 
<P>
Mike McCurry, the President's Press Secretary, has just resigned. 
He could no longer keep a straight face. 
<P>
<BR>=====<BR>
&gt;From: elnitsky@star.net (Serge Elnitsky)<BR>
&gt;Subject: One more for the Clinton digest<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Did you know that "Monica Lewinsky" is an anagram of "wank my silicone"? 
<P>
<BR>=====<BR>
&gt;From: salzberg@cmr.gov (David Salzberg)<BR>
&gt;Organization: Center for Monitoring Research<BR>
&gt;Subject: Original: Clinton's Library<BR>
<P>
</PRE>With all the recent scandals, it seems that Clinton's presidential library 
will be the first with a pornography section. 
<P>
<BR>=====<BR>
&gt;From: dbasinge@itos.uga.edu (Mike Basinger)<BR>
&gt;Organization: University of Georgia<BR>
&gt;Subject: Clinton People<BR>
<P>
</PRE>I keep hearing  people from Clinton's inner circle talk on radio and 
television saying that they are behind President Clinton 100%.  Good 
idea, since it's obviously not safe to stand in front of him. 
<P>
<BR>=====<BR>
&gt;From: irish@pizero.colorado.edu (Brian O'Reilly)<BR>
&gt;Organization: E831 University of Colorado<BR>
&gt;Subject: A heartbeat away??<BR>
<P>
</PRE>I suppose this means Al Gore is only six inches away from the 
presidency... 
<P>
<BR>=====<BR>
&gt;From: cradock@ssc.wisc.edu (Bob Cradock)<BR>
&gt;Subject: The scandal that keeps on ticking<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Doesn't Clinton realize that a coverup always gets you in more 
trouble than whatever you did in the first place? 
<P>
He should have just opened up, come clean, and taken his licks. 
<P>
Oops, I guess maybe he's already done that. 
<P>
<BR>=====<BR>
&gt;From: dbell@maths.tcd.ie (Derek Bell)<BR>
&gt;Subject: Clinton<BR>
<P>
</PRE>It looks like Clinton will be the second president to be 
brought down by "Deep Throat"! 
<P>
<BR>=====<BR>
&gt;From: Ken.Hamel@Colorado.EDU (Ken Hamel)<BR>
&gt;Subject: Clinton Q &amp; A<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Q: Why does Pres. Clinton wear boxer shorts? 
<P>
A: To keep his ankles warm. 
<P>
<BR>=====<BR>
&gt;From: brad@clari.net (Brad Templeton)<BR>
&gt;Subject: Tailgate<BR>
&gt;Organization: ClariNet Communications Corp.  external.html/brad<BR>
<P>
Q:	What's the difference between Dan Quayle and Bill Clinton?<BR>
A:	Quayle was no Jack Kennedy."<BR>
<P>
=====<BR>
&gt;From: Dean@locktrack.com (Dean Woodward)<BR>
&gt;Subject: Divorce Proceedings<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Thought of the day: 
<P>
If Bill Clinton's guilty of the charges against him, and Hillary 
divorces him (as would be justifiable if he's messing around:) 
<P>
Does she get to run half the country for the rest of his term? 
<P>
<BR>=====<BR>
&gt;From: john@hideaway.mv.com (John C. Hallyburton, Jr.)<BR>
&gt;Subject: Monica Lewinsky Career joke<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Q: Why was Monica Lewinsky transferred from the White House 
to the Pentagon? 
<P>
A: She was traded for two brunettes and a redhead to be named later.
