</PRE>A few weeks ago, me and a friend were going to have a night out. We started 
out in his flat, drinking gin &amp; tonics. We went to a rather popular club and 
ended up in a massive line. 30 minutes later we had almost reached the 
goal-line, when my friend started to get a green and pale complexion. 
Suddenly I saw a burst of vomit coming through the air and landing on the 
guy in front of us. When the unlucky man in front of turned around in an 
attempt to grasp what had happened, my friend raised his fist and threw a 
punch at the poor guy's chin and he went down. My friend leaped out of the 
line and ran away. 
<P>
When I caught up to him a few minutes later I asked him what the hell he was 
doing back in the line, he said that when he had thrown up on the other guy 
he was sure that there was some form of retaliation coming his way, so he 
simply decided to hit the other guy first. 
<P>
