</PRE>What follows are the latest entries in the Clinton file.  These are jokes 
which are funny, but which didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post 
such a digest whenever I have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly 
selective readers will probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to 
killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in the title - ed.

<TITLE>Conspiracy theories [rec.humor.funny]</TITLE>
<H1 align=center>Conspiracy theories</H1>
<P>
Absolutely true, actual statement by Hillary Clinton, as quoted in the<BR>
Rocky Mountain News on Wednesday, August 12:<BR>
<P>
"They're pursuing [Monicagate] because of where we're from. It's a<BR>
conspiracy against the state of Arkansas. They wouldn't do this if we were<BR>
from another state."<BR>
<P>
I told a coworker who is from Arkansas (and whose husband left her for a<BR>
14 year old girl) about this comment. Her response: "She may have a point.<BR>
In Washington, he's too old for her. In Arkansas it's the other way<BR>
around."<BR>

<H1 align=center>Sex-Ed</H1>
<P>
[ Constitutional lawyer Clint Bolick tells this one]<BR>
<P>
"Just a few months ago, we were arguing about whether children should<BR>
be taught about sex by their parents or by the schools, when our<BR>
innovative President found a third solution."<BR>

<H1 align=center>Excuses, excuses ...</H1>

Why did the Starr Report take so long to get out?<BR>
<P>
It was hard for him to type with only one free hand!<BR>

<H1 align=center>Internships</H1>
<P>
Old Testament, First Kings, Chapter 11, versus 1 &amp; 3.<BR>
<P>
But King Solomon loved many strange women..., women of the Moabites,<BR>
Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites....<BR>
<P>
And he had seven hundred wives (princesses), and three hundred interns.<BR>

<H1 align=center>Clinton's other children</H1>
<P>
IMHO, the best line of the night on Politically Incorrect with Bill<BR>
Maher (ABC), Monday, September 14, was spoken by Joan Rivers. She said<BR>
that in the current scandal, the one she felt sorry for was Chelsea<BR>
Clinton: because she would forever go through life wondering if she<BR>
might have a brother or sister somewhere--stuck to a dress!<BR>
