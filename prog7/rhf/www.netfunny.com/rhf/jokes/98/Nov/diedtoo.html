</PRE>A blonde goes into work one morning crying her eyes out. 
Her boss concerned about all his employees well being 
asked sympathetically, "What's the matter?" To which the 
blonde replies... "Early this morning I got a phone call 
saying that my mother had passed away." 
<P>
The boss feeling very sorry at this point explains to the 
young girl. "Why don't you go home for the day... we aren't 
terribly busy just take the day off to relax and rest." The 
blonde very calmly states..."No.. I'd be better off here. I 
need to keep my mind off it and I have the best chance of doing 
that here." The boss agrees and allows the blond to work as 
usual... " If you need anything just let me know." 
<P>
Well... a few hours pass and the boss decides to check on the 
blonde...he looks out over his office and sees the blonde 
hysterically crying!!!!! He rushes out to her asking " What's 
so bad now... are you gonna be okay??" 
<P>
"No..." exclaims the blonde, " I just received a horrible call 
from my sister and she said that her mom died too!!!!"
