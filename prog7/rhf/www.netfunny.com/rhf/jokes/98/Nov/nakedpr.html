</PRE>A minister, a priest and a rabbi went for a hike one day. It was very 
hot.They were sweating and exhausted when they came upon a small lake. 
Since it was fairly secluded, they took off all their clothes and 
jumped in the water. 
<P>
Feeling refreshed, the trio decided to pick a few berries while 
enjoying their "freedom." As they were crossing an open area, who 
should come  along but a group of ladies from town. Unable to get to 
their clothes in time, the minister and the priest covered their 
privates and the rabbi covered his face while they ran for cover. 
<P>
After the ladies had left and the men got their clothes back on, the 
minister and the priest asked the rabbi why he covered his face rather 
than his privates. The rabbi replied, "I don't know about you, but in 
MY congregation, it's my face they would recognize."
