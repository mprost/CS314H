<PRE>
One day a platoon of Marines are on patrol when they come upon a Ranger
relaxing on top of a small hill. The Ranger puts his hands on his hips
and screams out, "Do any of you seaweed sucking jarheads think you're
man enough to take me on?"

The biggest Marine comes running up the hill, screaming back at the
Ranger.  When he gets to the top he simply plows into his foe and the
two tumble down the other side of the hill, out of sight.  There is the
sound of a horrendous fight for a moment or two, and then all is
quiet.  Soon, the Ranger reappears, quite untouched.  He puts his hands
on his hips and sneers, "Well, looks to me like one of you couldn't do
it, how about the rest?"

The enraged Marine platoon leader sends his entire platoon (30+men)
charging after the Ranger.  They all go tumbling down the far side of
the hill.  After 15 minutes of screaming and yelling and cursing a
lone, bloodied Marine crawls over the top of the hill. The platoon
leader yells up to his man, "What's going on up there?" The wounded
Marine, with his last bit of breath, replies, "Sir, it's a... a trap,
sir.  There're two of them!"
