</PRE>A young lady had just visited her doctor and he informed her that she 
was pregnant.  The young lady had been married for ten years and had 
wanted a baby very badly.  As she sat on the bus, on her way home, she 
felt that she had to share the good news with someone.  The gentleman 
sitting next to her seemed as good as anyone to share the good news 
with. 
<P>
Sir, she said, I just received the best news you could ever imagine.  I 
have to share it with someone or I'll bust.  She told him the news that 
the doctor had told her about being pregnant. 
<P>
The man shared her enthusiam as he shared his expierence.  He said he 
was a farmer and he had trouble with his hens laying eggs.  He stated 
that he went out to the hen house one morning and all of his hens had 
layed eggs. He was so happy. he added, "but confidentially, I changed 
cocks." 
<P>
The newly pregnant woman responded "confidentially, me too."
