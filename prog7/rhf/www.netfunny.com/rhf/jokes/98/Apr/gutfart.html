</PRE>This great one comes from Dan Patton who is somewhere out there in 
cyberspace... 
<P>
There was an old married couple that had happily lived together for 
nearly forty years.  The only friction in their marriage was caused by 
the husband's habit of breaking wind nearly every morning as he awoke. 
<P>
The noise would always wake up his wife and the smell would cause her 
eyes to water as she would choke and gasp for air.  Nearly every 
morning she would plead with him to stop ripping one in the morning. 
He told her that the couldn't help it.  She begged him to see a doctor 
to see if anything could be done but the husband wouldn't hear of it. 
He told her that it was just a natural bodily function and then he 
would laugh in her face as she tried to wave the fumes away with her 
hands.  She told him that there was nothing natural about it and if he 
didn't stop, he was one day going to "fart his guts out." 
<P>
The years went by and the wife continued to suffer and the husband 
continued to ignore her warnings about "farting his guts out" until 
one Christmas morning.  Before dawn, the wife went downstairs to 
prepare the family feast.  She fixed Christmas pudding, mashed 
potatoes, gravy and of course a turkey.  While she was taking out the 
turkey's innards, a thought occurred to the wife as to how she might 
solve her husband's problem. With a devilish grin on her face, she 
placed the turkey guts into a bowl and quietly walked upstairs hours 
before her flatulent husband would awake. 
<P>
While he was still soundly asleep, she pulled back the covers and then 
gently pulled back her husband's jockey shorts.  She then placed all 
of the turkey guts into her husband's underwear, pulled them up, 
replaced the covers and tiptoed back downstairs to finish preparing 
the family meal. 
<P>
Several hours later she heard her husband awake with his normal loud 
ass trumpeting.  This was soon followed by a blood curdling scream and 
the sound of frantic footsteps as her husband ran to the upstairs 
bathroom. 
<P>
The wife could not control herself and her eyes began to tear up as 
she rolled on the floor laughing.  After years of putting up with him 
she had finally gotten even. 
<P>
About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood 
stained underpants with a look of horror in his eyes. She bit her lip 
to keep from laughing and she asked him what was the matter.  He said, 
"honey, you were right - all those years you warned me and I didn't 
listen to you." 
<P>
"What do you mean?" asked his wife.  "Well you always told me that I 
would end up farting my guts out one of these days and today it 
finally happened. 
<P>
But by the grace of God and these two fingers, I think I got 'em all 
back in." 
<P>
