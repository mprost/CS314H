</PRE>A Debtor, called in for an audit at the IRS, asked his accountant for 
advice on what to wear.  "Wear your shabbiest clothing.  Let him think 
you are a pauper."  Then he asked his lawyer the same question, but got 
the opposite advice.  "Do not let them intimidate you.  Wear your most 
elegant suit and tie."  Confused, the man went to his rabbi, told him of 
the conflicting advice, and requested some resolution of the dilemma. 
<P>
"Let me tell you a story," replied the rabbi.  "A woman, about to be 
married, asked her mother what to wear on her wedding night.  'Wear a 
heavy, long, flannel nightgown that goes right up to your neck.'  But 
when she asked her best friend, she got conflicting advice. 'Wear your 
most sexy negligee, with a V-neck right down to your navel.  The man 
protested:  "What does all this have to do with my problem with the 
IRS?"  The rabbi answered: "No matter what you wear, you are going to 
get screwed."
