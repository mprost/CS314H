<P>
by Robert D. Kaiser     kaiser@pofvax.pnb.sunysb.edu 
(Formerly known as "The Hebrew Geek Code") 
<P>
     Communicate volumes of information about yourself with just a few 
letters!  Give information to those in the know!  Don't limit yourself 
to useless one word descriptions like 'Reform' or 'Orthodox'. Instead, 
create your own Yiddishkeit code which will really tell people who and 
what you are all about!  Place your own code in your .sig file, and it 
will appear on all your e-mail messages. 
<P>
     Permission is granted to forward this as long as credit is given.  
E-mail me any additions that you think would be good.  They might end 
up in the next version. 
<P>
     Here is an example Yiddishkeit Code, which would be typically 
located in one's email signature file:    S+ Fa1 TM ng+ M K+ T tL AT++ 
SY+=/SY+++ Te+ SC P+ FO++= D+ Tz++ L- Am 
<P>
The above code translates to: 
     S+   Shabbat:  Conservative, will drive to shul 
     Fa1  Family:  Not married - Single 
     TM   Taharat Mishpacha:  Lenient observance.  Abstain while  
          the women is niddah, but don't follow Talmudic chumrot  
          of waiting an extra week. 
     Ng+  Conservative N'giah--only touch a consenting partner 
          I love and plan to marry. 
     M    Messiah: Could be real! 
     K+   Kashrut:  Conservative.  Kashrut fully observed.  Two sets 
          of dishes, etc.  Add appropriate strictures as necessary.+ 
     T    Talmud:  Studied in Hebrew school / Hebrew High School 
     tL   Tribe:  Levi 
     AT++ Attendance:  I go regularly on most Shabbats. 
     SY+  Synagogue:  Conservative (egalitarian) to SY+++  Orthodox 
     Te+  Tefillin:  Sure, sometimes.  Irregularly. 
     SC   Shabbat Candles:  Been there, done that. 
     P+   Pesach:  Even the pet eats tuna and matzah-brei for a week 
     FO++ Festival Observance: Full Observance - Conservative 
     D+   I also know the Sh'ma and Kaddish by heart, and can 
          somehow make it through most of the rest. 
     Tz++ Tzedakah:  Repeat donor to UJA, JNF, or SPCA 
     L-   Lashon Hara:  I never speak Lashon Hora, but I'll tell you 
          someone who does! 
<P>
As you can see, in just a line or two of the Yiddishkeit Code, you can 
say quite a lot about yourself without wasting precious Internet 
bandwidth!! 
<P>
<HR>
Qualifiers:    A&amp;B     Means A and B 
               A/B     Means ranging from A to B

     		Moses wrote the tractate regarding driving on Shabbat! 
     Ha++++	Meshuggedox.  Everyone else is a heretic, especially 
     		the Modern Orthodox (they're the worst!).  But I'll take 
     		their donations for my Yeshiva...

Shaving one's facial hair 
<P>
     FH--	I use a straight razor with boar's hair brush and foam to 
		shave every day.  (The Neo-Canaanite look is in...) 
     FH-	I use a disposable razor, but no shaving cream, so as to 
		make sure not to cut too close to the skin.  No cutting 
		above bone on peyot (upper sideburn area). 
     FH		I use an electric lift and cut razor. (These work by a 
		scissor principle, so they technically don't fall into the 
		prohibition against shaving with a razor).  But I never 
		asked a rabbi or friend in yeshiva if my particular model is 
		o.k.  Will occassionally cut peyot above reccomended area, 
		but will magic marker them in for date with a rich Orthodox 
		Jewish girl from Boro Park who prefers FH+ or FH++ 
     FH+	I use an electric razor model that has an o.k. by a 
		local posek.  Keep peyot at bottom of ear lobes; no shaving 
		during Chol Hamoed. 
     FH++	I will shave, but I have Litvak style peyot behind the ear. 
		No shaving during Sefirah and the Three Weeks (before Tisha 
		B'Av), so I can work in chinuch, for 47th St. Photo or for 
		Leshkowitz and Co. if an accountant 
     FH+++	I have a full beard. Don't trim.  Long peyot in an ultra- 
		orthodox style.  Will occasionally tuck under beard ends or 
		trim them when interviewing for well paying prestigious 
		rabbinical position or if elected chief rabbi of Israel.  Have 
		been offered position with Z-Z-Top. 
     FH++++	I have taken a full Nazirite vow

Israeli Politics 
<P>
     R for right-wing , L for left-wing 
<P>
     IPR+++++	Nuke the Arabs until their sand dunes become glass! 
     IPR++++	I live with my wife and kids in Hebron.  Kahane Chai! 
     IPR+++	I live (or would like to live) in a small settlement 
		in the Shomron (Samaria).  Supporter of Zo Artzenu. 
     IPR++	I live (or would like to live) in a Gush Emunim town. 
     IPR+	Likud die-hard. 
     IPR	Just right of center.  Might have voted for Rabin, but 
		never for Peres. 
     IP		My wife and I split our vote between Labor &amp; Likud. 
     IPL	I'm usually left wing, but Bibi's much cuter than 
		Shimon, so he got my wife's vote. 
     IPL+	Go to all the Peace Now rallies. 
     IPL++	The Oslo Accords are as sacred as the Torah. 
     IPL+++	Member of Aviv Geffen fan club.  All Israeli youth 
		should emigrate! 
     IPL++++	Meretz is right wing!  Shulamit Aloni is a goddess! 
     IPL+++++	See I-- or UN resolution stating that "Zionism is 
		racism."  I only live in Israel since I can't afford 
		to get out! 
     IP-	I am apolitical.  This negates all other Yiddishkeit  
		codes since it is impossible to be Jewish and apolitical!
