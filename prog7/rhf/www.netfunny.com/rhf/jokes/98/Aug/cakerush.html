</PRE>A baker is just getting ready lock his front door when a man rushes up.  "I 
need to have a cake made right now!" he exclaims. 
<P>
"I'm sorry," replies the baker.  "But I was just closing up.  I've 
dismissed my staff; I've shut down my machines; I'm afraid you'll have to 
come back tomorrow." 
<P>
"I can't wait until tomorrow!" insists the man.  "It's absolutely 
imperative that this cake be made right now!" 
<P>
The baker always liked to think of himself as a nice guy, so he says, "All 
right, I'll see what I can do."  He goes  inside and turns all his 
appliances back on.  He then approaches the counter and ties on his apron. 
"Okay, what is it you need?" 
<P>
The man whips out a sketch from his pocket.  It's a very well drawn 
depiction of a cake.  "It has to look just like this," says the man. 
"Exactly one foot wide, one foot long, and six inches tall.  White 
frosting, blue icing, and a red cursive "S" in the middle.  Just like 
this." 
<P>
Somewhat startled, the baker ponders the sketch for a few moments and 
replies. "I think I can do that.  It will be ready in about half an hour." 
<P>
"Half an hour!?" exclaims the man.  "That won't do.  I need this in fifteen 
minutes." 
<P>
"Fifteen minutes?" responds the baker.  "I'm not sure I can do that.  I 
suppose I might be able to get it done that fast if I used some pre-made 
dough.  It wouldn't taste as good but..." 
<P>
"I don't care.  Just get to it, please," blurts the man, while checking his 
watch frantically. 
<P>
So the baker goes back and makes the cake.  He works faster than he ever 
has before, and somehow produces the cake in just under fifteen minutes. 
He presents it to the man fresh out of the oven.  "Will this be 
sufficient?" he asks. 
<P>
The man takes a measuring tape from his pocket.  He checks the length, 
width, and height very carefully.  He then compares it to the sketch. 
Suddenly, a look of horror comes across his face.  "No no!" he exclaims. 
"The 's' is the wrong shade of red!  It has to be the same shade as the 
sketch.  Oh, what will I do now??" 
<P>
"Calm down," says the baker.  "If the shade really is a problem I think I 
can re-ice it.  It may take a few more minutes..." 
<P>
"You can?" asks the man anxiously.  "Well please, get going!" 
<P>
So the baker quickly takes the cake back and puts on a new "S."  A few 
minutes later he brings it back to the visibly distraught man.  "There you 
go.  Is this what you were looking for?" he asks. 
<P>
Once again the man scrutinizes the cake, checking every detail.  He 
compares the shades of red, and this time decides they're all right. 
"Okay" says the man quickly, "this is good.  Can I pay you now." 
<P>
"Of course," says the baker, hastily readying the cash register.  "Now, the 
boxes we have available are over here.  Do you want to pick one out?" 
<P>
"Oh no, that won't be necessary," answers the man.  "I'll eat it here." 
<P>
