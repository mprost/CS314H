<BR>Here's one about the old native American who wanted a loan for $500.<BR>
The banker pulled out the loan application, "What are you going<BR>
to do with the money?"<BR>
"Take jewelry to city and sell it," was the response.<BR>
"What have you got for collateral?"<BR>
"Don't know collateral."<BR>
"Well that's something of value that would cover the cost of<BR>
the loan.Have you got any vehicles?"<BR>
"Yes, 1949 Chevy pickup."<BR>
The banker shook his head, "How about livestock?"<BR>
"Yes, I have a horse."<BR>
"How old is it?"<BR>
"Don't know, has no teeth."<BR>
Finally the banker decided to make the $500 loan.<BR>
Several weeks later the old man was back in the bank. He pulled<BR>
out a roll of bills, "Here to pay." he said.<BR>
He then handed the banker the money to pay his loan off<BR>
"What are you going to do with the rest of that money?"<BR>
"Put in teepee."<BR>
"Why don't you deposit it in my bank," he asked.<BR>
"Don't know deposit."<BR>
"You put the money in our bank and we take care of it for you.<BR>
When you want to use it you can withdraw it."<BR>
The old Indian leaned across the desk, "What you got for<BR>
collateral?"<BR>
