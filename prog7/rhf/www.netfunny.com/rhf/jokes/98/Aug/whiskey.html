</PRE>This is an old joke of unknown orgin that I heard and probably retold a 
thousand times while bartending in colege. 
<P>
Two Scottsmen, Angus and MacDougal, have grown up in the same village 
together. They were friends all their lives, married a pair of sisters, 
and lived just down the street from each other. But now, MacDougal has 
the cancer, and is lying on his deathbed, surrounded by his friends. 
<P>
He calls, "Angus, come 'ere Angus. I 'ave a request for ye." Angus walks 
to his friends bedside and neels down.20 
<P>
"Angus, we been friends all our lives, and now I'm dying 'ere. I 'ave 
one last request fir ye to do." 
<P>
Angus bursts into tears, "Anything MacDougal, anything ye wish. It's 
done." 
<P>
"Well, under me bed is a box containing a bottle of the finest whiskey 
in all of Scotland. Bottled the year I was born, it was. After I die, 
and they plant me in the ground, I want you to pour that fine whiskey 
over me grave so it might soak into me bones and I'll be able to enjoy 
it for all eternity." 
<P>
Angus is overcome by the beauty and true Scottish spirit of his friends 
request. 
<P>
"Aye, tis a fine thing you ask of me McDougal, and I will pour the 
whiskey. But, might I strain it through me kidneys first?" 
<P>
