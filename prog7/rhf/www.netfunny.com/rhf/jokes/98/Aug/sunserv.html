</PRE>I have witnesses that this actually happened a few years ago: 
<P>
My client was trying to pick a server platform and was torn between Sun 
and IBM for the UNIX server.  Finally, after receiving a generous 
discount from IBM, they chose IBM's AIX.  Unfortunately, I had no AIX 
experience, so I was overheard saying, "...but I know how to do this on 
Sun..."  Another consultant was brought in who claimed that he had some 
AIX experience and he was also overheard by the director saying, "...but 
I know how to do this on Sun." 
<P>
So the director was so frustrated, he called IBM and asked to have their 
best AIX professional sent over to straighten us out.  In the director's 
office, he was told the problem and his first words were, "Gee, that's 
tough.  I'm not sure, but I do know how to do that on Sun." 
<P>
The Sun servers arrived without comment from the director.
