</PRE>I've digested up several of the recent Clinton quickies (so to speak) that 
I've received.  These are jokes which are funny, but which didn't really 
warrant posting separately.  I post such a digest whenever I have enough 
entries to warrant it.  Particularly selective readers will probably not 
enjoy the digests, and may want to killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in the 
title - ed.

I heard that President Clinton's favorite actor is Charlton Heston.<BR>
In fact, Clinton said he thinks that the best film of all time is<BR>
``The Nine Commandments.''<BR>

Bill Clinton is NOT a liar.  Just ask Monica Lewinsky.  She'll tell<BR>
you he gave it to her straight.<BR>

<H1 align=center>You heard it here first...</H1>
<P>
Prediction:<BR>
<P>
Two days before his scheduled grand jury appearance,<BR>
Clinton will go on TV to announce that he <I>did</I> have<BR>
sex with Monica Lewinsky but that it doesn't really<BR>
count because she didn't, um, inhale.<BR>

Heard on the Bob and Tom show (syndicated radio morning show, various markets):<BR>

A:  Clinton's pool table.<BR>

<H1 align=center>The last four years in 22 words or less</H1>
<P>
US President Bill Clinton, who has become quite famous for his<BR>
blatantly side-stepping style of speaking, had this to say about<BR>
his upcoming testimony before the Grand Jury:<BR>
<P>
"No one wants to get this matter behind us more than I do,<BR>
except maybe all the rest of the American people."<BR>
<P>
Yep, that's our Bill.<BR>

<H1 align=center>DNA and "the dress"</H1>
<P>
Heard on the radio: The FBI is having a real difficult time with the<BR>
"bodily fluids" found on the Lewinsky dress. Seems everybody in Arkansas<BR>
has the same DNA...<BR>

<H1 align=center>Monica Lewinsky</H1>
<P>
Paraphrased from Irish comedian Graham Norton on UK TV last night:<BR>
<P>
"It's nice to see Monica Lewinsky getting ahead in life.<BR>
After all, in her high school yearbook she was voted<BR>
'Girl Most Likely To Suck Seed'."<BR>

<TITLE>Status Report from the White House [rec.humor.funny]</TITLE>
<H1 align=center>Status Report from the White House</H1>
<P>
In an Associated Press article by Larry Margasak today, Clinton's deputy<BR>
press secretary was asked whether the fact that Monica Lewinsky was<BR>
testifying was upsetting any matters at the White House.<BR>
<P>
Asked if it were a difficult day for the White House, Toiv said, ``No. We<BR>
do our work here every day regardless of what's going on in the outside<BR>
world.''<BR>
<P>
Is it just me or is that statement somehow less than encouraging?<BR>
