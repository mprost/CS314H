</PRE>One of my friends works in the customer service call center of a 
national pager company. He deals with the usual complaints regarding 
poor pager operation, as well as the occasional crank caller demanding 
to be paged less often, more often, or by more interesting people. 
<P>
The best call came from a man who repeatedly complained that he being 
paged by "Lucille." He was instructed that he would have to call her and 
tell her to stop paging him. 
<P>
"She don't never leave no number, so I can't call her back," he said. 
<P>
After three such calls, someone thought to ask how he knew it was 
Lucille if she didn't leave a number. 
<P>
"She leaves her name" was the reply. 
<P>
After establishing that the customer had a numeric-only pager, the light 
bulb came on. "How does she spell her name?" the service rep asked. 
<P>
"L-O-W C-E-L-L"
