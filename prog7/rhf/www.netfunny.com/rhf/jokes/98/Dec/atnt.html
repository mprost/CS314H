<P>
</PRE>One thing that has always bugged me, and I'm sure it does most of you, is to 
sit down at the dinner table only to be interrupted by a phone call from a 
telemarketer. I decided, on one such occasion, to try to be as irritating as 
they were to me. The call was from AT&amp;T and it went something like this: 
<P>
<BR>Me: Hello<BR>
AT&amp;T: Hello, this is AT&amp;T...<BR>
Me: Is this AT&amp;T?<BR>
AT&amp;T: Yes, this is AT&amp;T...<BR>
Me: This is AT&amp;T?<BR>
AT&amp;T: Yes This is AT&amp;T...<BR>
Me: Is this AT&amp;T?<BR>
AT&amp;T: YES! This is AT&amp;T, may I speak to Mr. Byron please?<BR>
Me: May I ask who is calling?<BR>
AT&amp;T: This is AT&amp;T.<BR>
Me: OK, hold on.<BR>
<P>
</PRE>At this point I put the phone down for a solid 5 minutes thinking that, 
surely, this person would have hung up the phone. Much to my surprise, when 
I picked up the receiver, they were still waiting. 
<P>
<BR>Me: Hello?<BR>
AT&amp;T: Is this Mr. Byron?<BR>
Me: May I ask who is calling please?<BR>
AT&amp;T: Yes this is AT&amp;T...<BR>
Me: Is this AT&amp;T?<BR>
AT&amp;T: Yes this is AT&amp;T...<BR>
Me: This is AT&amp;T?<BR>
AT&amp;T: Yes, is this Mr. Byron?<BR>
Me: Yes, is this AT&amp;T?<BR>
AT&amp;T: Yes sir.<BR>
Me: The phone company?<BR>
AT&amp;T: Yes sir.<BR>
Me: I thought you said this was AT&amp;T.<BR>
AT&amp;T: Yes sir, we are a phone company.<BR>
Me: I already have a phone.<BR>
AT&amp;T: We aren't selling phones today Mr. Byron.<BR>
Me: Well whatever it is, I'm really not interested but thanks for calling.<BR>
<P>
</PRE>When you are not interested in something, I don't think you can express 
yourself any plainer than by saying "I'm really not interested," but this 
lady was persistent. 
<P>
AT&amp;T: Mr. Byron we would like to offer you 10 cents a minute, 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. 
<P>
Now, I am sure she meant she was offering a "rate" of 10 cents a minute but 
she at no time used the word rate. I could clearly see that it was time to 
whip out the trusty old calculator and do a little ciphering. 
<P>
<BR>Me: Now, that's 10 cents a minute 24 hours a day?<BR>
AT&amp;T: (getting a little excited at this point by my interest) Yes sir<BR>
that's right! 24 hours a day!<BR>
Me: 7 days a week?<BR>
AT&amp;T: That's right.<BR>
Me: 365 days a year?<BR>
AT&amp;T: Yes sir.<BR>
Me: I am definitely interested in that! Wow!!! That's amazing!<BR>
AT&amp;T: We think so!<BR>
Me: That's quite a sum of money!<BR>
AT&amp;T: Yes sir, it's amazing how it ads up.<BR>
Me: OK, so will you send me checks weekly, monthly or just one big one at<BR>
the end of the year for the full $52,560, and if you send an annual check,<BR>
can I get a cash advance?<BR>
AT&amp;T: Excuse me?<BR>
Me: You know, the 10 cents a minute.<BR>
AT&amp;T: What are you talking about?<BR>
Me: You said you'd give me 10 cents a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a<BR>
week, 365 days a year. That comes to $144 per day, $1008 per week and<BR>
$52,560 per year. I'm just interested in knowing how you will be making<BR>
payment.<BR>
AT&amp;T: Oh no sir I didn't mean we'd be paying you. You pay us 10 cents a<BR>
minute.<BR>
Me: Wait a minute here!!! Didn't you say you'd give me 10 cents a minute.<BR>
Are you sure this is AT&amp;T?<BR>
AT&amp;T: Well, yes this is AT&amp;T sir but......<BR>
Me: But nothing, how do you figure that by saying that you'll give me 10<BR>
cents a minute that I'll give you 10 cents a minute? Is this some kind of<BR>
subliminal telemarketing scheme? I've read about things like this in the<BR>
Enquirer you know. Don't use your alien brainwashing techniques on me.<BR>
AT&amp;T: No sir we are offering 10 cents a minute for.....<BR>
Me: THERE YOU GO AGAIN! Can I speak to a supervisor please!<BR>
AT&amp;T: Sir I don't think that is necessary.<BR>
Me: Sure! You say that now! What happens later?<BR>
AT&amp;T: What?<BR>
Me: I insist on speaking to a supervisor!<BR>
AT&amp;T: Yes Mr. Byron. Please hold.<BR>
<P>
</PRE>So now AT&amp;T has me on hold and my supper is getting cold. I begin to eat 
while I'm waiting for a supervisor. After a wait of a few minutes and while 
I have a mouth full of food: 
<P>
<BR>Supervisor: Mr. Byron?<BR>
Me: Yeth?<BR>
Supervisor: I understand you are not quite understanding our 10 cents a<BR>
minute program.<BR>
Me: Id thish Ath Teeth &amp; Teeth?<BR>
Supervisor: Yes sir, it sure is.<BR>
<P>
</PRE>I had to swallow before I choked on my food. It was all I could do to 
suppress my laughter and I had to be careful not to produce a snort. 
<P>
<BR>Me: No, actually I was just waiting for someone to get back to me so that I<BR>
could sign up for the plan.<BR>
Supervisor: OK, no problem, I'll transfer you back to the person who was<BR>
helping you.<BR>
Me: Thank you.<BR>
<P>
</PRE>I was on hold once again and was getting really hungry. I needed to end 
this conversation. Suddenly, there was an aggravated but polite voice at the 
other end of the phone. 
<P>
<BR>AT&amp;T: Hello Mr. Byron, I understand that you are interested in signing up<BR>
for our plan?<BR>
Me: Do you have that friends and family thing because you can never have<BR>
enough friends and I'm an only child and I'd really like to have a little<BR>
brother...<BR>
AT&amp;T: (click)<BR>
<P>
[I wrote this story about a year ago and have been seeing it posted on<BR>
several joke lists. I thought now was a good time to claim the credit as the<BR>
creator of the piece. I will add, because I have heard that a few think<BR>
otherwise, that the AT&amp;T story is based entirely on fact. The original can<BR>
be found at external.html/Robeo for those who are interested.]<BR>
