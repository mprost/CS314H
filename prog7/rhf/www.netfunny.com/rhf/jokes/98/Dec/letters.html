</PRE>Yesterday, I helped my mother-in-law get set up on email for the first 
time.  She got frustrated from time to time.  Upon reflection, I decided 
that frustration was perfectly understandable.  Imagine trying to learn 
to write a letter for the first time... 
<P>
<BR><address>
<P>
Me: Ok, to write a letter, the first thing you need is a piece of paper<BR>
and a pen.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan:  What are those?<BR>
<P>
Me: Paper is flat stuff that is made from tree pulp, sort of like a very<BR>
small blackboard.  Pens are sticks that write, sort of like chalk but smaller<BR>
and in darker colors.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: Is this paper?<BR>
<P>
Me: Ah, yes, that is paper, but you don't want to write a letter on that,<BR>
that's my paycheck.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: Why can't I use this?<BR>
<P>
Me: Well, that's a representation of money that I .. uh, never mind.  Just<BR>
don't write on that.  Look, here's a piece of paper that you can write on.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: What about a pen?<BR>
<P>
Me: Pens are like little sticks.  Do you see anything on this desk that looks<BR>
like a little stick?  Uh, no, that's a ruler.  Rulers are for measuring<BR>
things.  Uh, no, that's a toothpick, it's for cleaning teeth, I don't know<BR>
why it's on my desk.  Look, here's a pen.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: That doesn't look like a little stick!  It's grey.  Little sticks<BR>
are brown.<BR>
<P>
Me: I meant "little stick" metaphorically.  Just use this.  Uh, you<BR>
have to take the cap off first.  Ok, now write "Dear Mom" on the paper.  Wait,<BR>
you want to rotate the paper so that the short side is at the top and the<BR>
long side comes towards you.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: Why?<BR>
<P>
Me: Well, that's just how it's done.  I suppose you could do it the other<BR>
way, but it would look a little funny.  Ok, now write "Dear Mom" on the--<BR>
oh, no, at the top.  Well, never mind, we can just throw this one away and<BR>
start over.  That's right, "Dear Mom" at the top.  Then the rest of the letter.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: Ok, I've finished the letter!  Can we go hunting now?<BR>
<P>
Me: Well, you aren't really done.  I mean, you are done with the letter,<BR>
but now you have to send it.  You need to put the letter in an envelope<BR>
next.  An envelope is a piece of paper that is all folded up to hide and<BR>
protect the letter.  Uh, no, put my paycheck down, we don't want to fold it<BR>
into an envelope.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: Wouldn't that work?<BR>
<P>
Me: Well, yeah, it would *work*, but it isn't the best way to do it, and<BR>
besides, I want to keep my paycheck.  Look, just put your letter into<BR>
this envelope here.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: It won't fit.<BR>
<P>
Me: Yeah, you have to fold it first.  Um, it will work better if you fold<BR>
it into thirds.  No, the other way.  There you go, now put it in the envelope.<BR>
Good.  Now seal the envelope by licking the paper here and folding it<BR>
over.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: You <B>must</B> be joking!<BR>
<P>
Me: No, really, that's how you seal the envelope.  Look, if you don't want to<BR>
lick it, you could get a little sponge and dish of water and use the sponge<BR>
to wet the envelope flap.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: I'll just go dunk it in the creek then.<BR>
<P>
Me: NO!  Sorry, I didn't mean to yell.  Look, I'll show you, <B>I</B> will lick<BR>
it for you.  See?  Easy.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: Ok, now can we go hunting?<BR>
<P>
Me: No, not yet, we still need to address the mail so that the postman<BR>
knows who should get the envelope.  So on the envelope, write<BR>
"Lady Greystoke" - nonono over here.  Well, never mind, we can get a new<BR>
envelope for it.  I'll take it out of the old one for you.  Ok, here's<BR>
a new envelope for you, see if you can put it in - that's good - and seal<BR>
it.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: I cut my tongue!<BR>
<P>
Me: Ooops.  It does take a little getting used to.  Ok, now write "Lady<BR>
Greystoke" right here.  Good!  Ok, now we need to look up her address<BR>
in the address book.  This is my address book, and you'll have to make<BR>
your own address book and fill it in with addresses.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: How will I know what people's addresses are?<BR>
<P>
Me: You'll just ask them for their address.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: How can I ask them if I can't write to them?<BR>
<P>
Me: You have to ask them some other way, like when you see them in person.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: Why can't I just get a big book with everybody's address in it?<BR>
<P>
Me: Well, there are five billion people in the world, so it would be an<BR>
awfully big book, plus people move all the time, plus some people wouldn't<BR>
want their address in the book.  Look, trust me, it works.  You'll get<BR>
people's addresses.  Ok, so underneath her name, write her address.  Uh,<BR>
you put the street address on its own line, then the city and state and<BR>
ZIP code.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: What's a ZIP code?<BR>
<P>
Me: Don't worry about it, just do it.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: Hmmpf. It would be a lot easier if I could just put "Mom."  Ok, it's<BR>
addressed.  NOW can we go hunting?<BR>
<P>
Me: Hold your horses. You need to put your return address in the upper<BR>
left-hand corner of the envelope.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: What's my return address?<BR>
<P>
Me: It's how people can contact you.  Your landlord should have given you<BR>
a piece of paper with your address on it.  Yeah, that looks right, now<BR>
copy that to the upper left corner.  Upper LEFT corner.  Good.  Ack!  My desk!<BR>
Put the cap back on!<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: Huh?<BR>
<P>
Me: It's very important that you put the cap back on the pen so that the<BR>
ink from the pen doesn't get all over everything.  Ok, now we have to put a<BR>
stamp on the envelope, which is a way of paying for the delivery.  You need<BR>
a 32-cent stamp.  Never mind why.  You need to put it in the upper right<BR>
hand corner, no, right-side up - so the 32 is right-side up.  No, it won't<BR>
stay by itself, you have to lick it.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: I'm not licking anything else, I cut my tongue last time.<BR>
<P>
Me: Oh, all right.  I'll lick it for you this time.  Tomorrow you can go<BR>
buy a different kind of stamps that you don't have to lick.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: How many different types of stamps are there?<BR>
<P>
Me: Well, there's stamps you lick and self-adhesive stamps, and different<BR>
denominations of stamps, oh, and there are stamps from other countries but<BR>
you can't use them.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: Why not?<BR>
<P>
Me: Because our government doesn't recognize those stamps.  And we can't use<BR>
our stamps in other countries.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: So do I have to use two different stamps if I send something to another<BR>
country?<BR>
<P>
Me: No, there's an agreement with other countries that they will deliver<BR>
mail with our stamps if they come from outside the country.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: So why can't we use other countries' stamps inside our country?<BR>
<P>
Me: They just won't, leave it be.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: Ok, I'm going hunting now.<BR>
<P>
Me: Just a minute, just a minute!  How do you think the letter is going<BR>
to get to your mother?  Did you think it was just going to magically leap<BR>
from the desk and get to her?  We need to take it somewhere that the Post<BR>
Office can find it.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: How about under my pillow?<BR>
<P>
Me: Don't be smart with me, young man.  We need to take it and either<BR>
put it in the mailbox or take it down to the post office.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: Isn't the mailbox where mail comes *in*?<BR>
<P>
Me: Yes, but the postman will take it out of the mailbox and take it down<BR>
to the post office if it is already there.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: Does that mean that if I don't take my incoming mail out of my<BR>
mailbox by the time the mailman comes again, he'll take all my mail away?<BR>
<P>
Me: No, it doesn't work like that.  Look, it just works, ok?  Just go<BR>
put it in the mailbox, I'm tired of arguing with you.  Then go play in<BR>
the jungle or whatever, just leave me alone.<BR>
<P>
Tarzan: <B>Sigh</B>  Letter-writing is *hard*!<BR>
<P>
<BR><address>
<P>
Email looks pretty easy in comparison!<BR>
