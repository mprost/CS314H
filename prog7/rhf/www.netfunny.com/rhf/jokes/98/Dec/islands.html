</PRE>There are nine beautiful deserted islands in the middle of 
nowhere where the following people are stranded: 
<P>
2 Italian men and 1 Italian woman 
2 French men and 1 French woman 
2 German men and 1 German woman 
2 Greek men and 1 Greek woman 
2 English men and 1 English woman 
2 Bulgarian men and 1 Bulgarian woman 
2 Japanese men and 1 Japanese woman 
2 Irish men and 1 Irish woman 
2 American men and 1 American woman 
<P>
</PRE>One month later on these absolutely stunning deserted islands in the 
middle of nowhere, the following things have occurred. 
<P>
One Italian man killed the other Italian man for the Italian woman. 
<P>
The two French men and the French woman are living happily together 
in a menage a trois. 
<P>
The 2 German men have a strict weekly schedule of when they 
alternate with the German woman. 
<P>
The 2 Greek men are sleeping with each other and the Greek woman is 
cleaning and cooking for them. 
<P>
The 2 English men are waiting for someone to properly introduce them 
to the English woman. 
<P>
The Bulgarian men took one look at the endless ocean, another look at 
the Bulgarian woman, and started swimming. 
<P>
The two Japanese men have faxed Tokyo on their wristband "Faxi-Mon" 
and are still waiting for instructions. 
<P>
The Irish began by dividing the island into North and South and by 
setting up a distillery. They do not remember if sex with the ravishing 
tempremental redhed is in the picture because it gets sort of foggy after 
the first few liters of coconut whiskey, but they are satisfied in that 
at least the English are not getting any. 
<P>
The two American men are contemplating the virtues of suicide as 
they listen to the American woman bitching about how sex is always 
unsatisfying, on the true nature of feminism, how she can do everything 
that they can do only better, about the necessity of fulfillment, the 
equal division of household chores, how all men except her father are 
pigs, how her relationship with her mother is improving, and how her 
last boyfriend, even though he was a pig, respected her opinion and 
treated her much nicer, at least before he committed suicide. 
<P>
But, on the American island, at least the taxes are low and it is 
not raining. 
<P>
