</PRE>Thirty New Yorkers arrived at the Pearly Gates.  Saint Peter looked at 
his list, then told the new arrivals, "I'm sorry, but there's been a 
mix-up.  Someone gave me the wrong list, and I can't tell which of you 
I'm supposed to let in.  Please wait here, while I go speak to God." 
<P>
So St. Peter went to God and told Him: "There are thirty New Yorkers 
waiting to get into heaven, and I don't have the information about 
whom I'm supposed to let in and whom I turn back." 
<P>
God told him: "Only ten of them are supposed to be let into heaven. 
You will have to prepare a test to see which ones are to join us." 
<P>
St. Peter thanked God and left.  Only a few moments later, St. Peter 
was back in God's presence, saying "They're gone!!" 
<P>
"All thirty of them are gone?" said God. 
<P>
"Not the New Yorkers," said St. Peter, "the gates!!"
