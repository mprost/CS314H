</PRE>A man goes to the doctor with a long history of migraine headaches. 
When the doctor does his history and physical, he discovers that the 
poor guy has tried practically every therapy known to man for his 
migraines and STILL no improvement. 
<P>
"Listen," says the doc, "I have migraines, too and the advice I'm going 
to give you isn't really anything I learned in medical school, but it's 
advice that I've gotten from my own experience.  When I have a migraine, 
I go home, get in a nice hot bathtub, and soak for a while.  Then I have 
my wife sponge me off with the hottest water I can stand, especially 
around the forehead.  This helps a little.  Then I get out of the tub, 
take her into the bedroom, and even if my head is killing me, I force 
myself to have sex with her.  Almost always, the headache is immediately 
gone.  Now, give it a try, and come back and see me in six weeks." 
<P>
Six weeks later, the patient returns with a big grin.  "Doc!  I took 
your advice and it works!  It REALLY WORKS!  I've had migraines for 17 
years and this is the FIRST time anyone has ever helped me!" 
<P>
"Well," says the physician, "I'm glad I could help." 
<P>
"By the way, Doc," the patient adds, "You have a REALLY nice house."
