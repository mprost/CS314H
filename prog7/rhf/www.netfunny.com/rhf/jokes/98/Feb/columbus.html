Indigenous Peoples-Columbus Day - (A True Story)<BR>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
</PRE>In 1990, the Berkeley City Council passed a law changing the name of 
Columbus Day to Native American Day because Columbus wasn't nice to 
the Indians. Of course, no Indians were asked if they wanted the 
holiday's name changed or if they wanted to be called Native 
Americans. 
<P>
In 1991, the Berkeley City Council changed the name again, to 
Indigenous People Day. A group of P.C.ers argued that Indians are not 
native to America but to Asia, so calling them Native Americans might 
be insulting to Asians. Of course, neither the Indian or Asian 
communities were consulted about this. 
<P>
In 1992, the Italian American Anti-Defamation League gave the City of 
Berkeley their Insensitivity Award. The Italian-American group said 
that they agreed that Indians haven't been treated well, but that the 
Italians weren't the ones who did it, so why take away their holiday? 
Nobody asked Italian-American how they felt about renaming Columbus 
day. 
<P>
In 1994, the Berkeley City Council changed the holiday back to 
Columbus Day. 
<P>
In 1995, representatives of the Winnamucca Indians protested City 
Council meetings. They argued that Indians had never asked that 
Columbus day be renamed to honor Indians, since it had, the City 
Council couldn't take it back, less they become "indigenous peoples 
givers." 
<P>
In 1996, the City Council changed the name to Indigenous Peoples - 
Columbus Day. 
<P>
Currently there are people lobbying to rename the holiday Animal 
Rights Day.
