<PRE>At a medical convention, a male doctor, and a female doctor start
eyeing each other. The male doc asks her to dinner and she accepts.
As they sit down at the restaurant, she excuses herself to go and
wash her hands.

After dinner, one thing leads to another and they end up in her
hotel bedroom. Just as things get hot, the female doc interrupts and
says she has to go and wash her hands. Once she comes back they go for it.

After the sexual interlude, she gets up and says she is going to
wash her hands.  As she comes back the male doc says "I bet you are
a surgeon".

She confirms and asks how he knew. 

"Easy, you're always washing your hands". 

She then says "I bet you're an anesthesiologist".

Male doc: "Wow, how did you guess?" 

Female doc: "I didn't feel a thing".
