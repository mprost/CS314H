<PRE>     
Now that Bill Gates has moved into his brand spanking new house 
in the Seattle suburbs, the following is a conversation 
overheard last week: 
     
Bill:  "There are a few issues we need to discuss."
     
Contractor:  "Ah, you have our basic support option.  Calls are free for the 
first 90 days and $75 a call thereafter.  Okay?"
     
Bill:  "Uh, yeah... the first issue is the living room.  We think its a little 
smaller than we anticipated."
     
Contractor:  "Yeah.  Some compromises were made to have it out by the release 
date."
     
Bill:  "We won't be able to fit all our furniture in there."
     
Contractor:  "Well, you have two options.  You can purchase a new, larger 
living room; or you can use Stacker."
     
Bill:  "Stacker?"
     
Contractor:  "Yeah, it allows you to fit twice as much furniture into the 
room.   By stacking it, of course, you put the entertainment center on the 
couch... the chairs on the table... etc.  You leave an empty spot, so when 
you want to use some furniture you can unstack what you need and then put it 
back when you're done."
     
Bill:  "Uh... I dunno... issue two.  The second issue is the light fixtures.  
The bulbs we brought with us from our old home won't fit.  The
threads run the wrong way."
     
Contractor:  "Oh!  That's easy.  Those bulbs aren't plug and play. 
You'll have to upgrade to the new bulbs."
     
Bill:  "And the electrical outlets?  The holes are round, not rectangular. How 
do I fix that?"
     
Contractor:  "Just uninstall and reinstall the electrical system." 
     
Bill:  "You're kidding!?"
     
Contractor:  "Nope.  Its the only way."
     
Bill:  "&lt;sigh&gt; Well... I have one last problem.  Sometimes, when I have 
guests over, someone will flush the toilet and it won't stop.  The water 
pressure drops so low that the showers don't work."
     
Contractor:  "That's a resource leakage problem.  One fixture fails to 
terminate and is hogging the resources preventing access from other 
fixtures."
     
Bill:  "And how do I fix that?"
     
Contractor:  "Well, after each flush, you all need to exit the house, turn off 
the water at the street, turn it back on, re-enter the house and then you'll be 
back on track."
     
Bill:  "That's the last straw.  What kind of product are you selling me?"
     
Contractor:  "Hey, remember, if you don't like it, nobody made you buy it." 
     
Bill:  "And when will this be fixed?"
     
Contractor:  "Oh, in your next house-which will be ready to release sometime 
near the end of 1998.  Actually it was due out earlier this year,
but we've had some delays..."
