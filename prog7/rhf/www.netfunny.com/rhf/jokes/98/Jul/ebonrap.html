</PRE>This paper was turned in by an Oakland High school student who received 
the highest honors at the school district's ebonics translation 
competition. 
<P>
Assignment: Please translate the following Rap song lyrics from Ebonics 
to standard English. 
<P>
<BR>Artist: Notorious B.I.G.<BR>
Album: Ready to Die<BR>
Song: One more chance (remix)<BR>
<P>
Lyrics:<BR>
First things first, I poppa, freaks all the honeys<BR>
Dummies - playboy bunnies, those wantin' money<BR>
Those the ones I like 'cause they don't get nathan'<BR>
But penetration, unless it smells like sanitation<BR>
Garbage, I turn like doorknobs<BR>
Heart throb, never, black and ugly as ever<BR>
However, I stay coochied down to the socks<BR>
Rings and watch filled with rocks<BR>
<P>
TRANSLATION:<BR>
<P>
</PRE>As a general rule, I perform deviant sexual acts with women of 
all kinds, including but not limited to those with limited intellect, 
nude magazine models, and prostitutes.  I particularly enjoy sexual 
encounters with the latter group as they are generally disappointed in 
the fact that they only receive penile intercourse and nothing more, 
unless of course, they douche on a consistent basis.  Although I am 
extremely unattractive, I am able to engage in these types of sexual 
acts with some regularity.  Perhaps my sexuality is somehow related to 
my fancy and expensive jewelry. 
<P>
<BR>Lyrics:<BR>
And my jam knock in the Mitsubishi<BR>
Girls pee pee when they see me, Nava-hoes creep me in they tee pee<BR>
As I lay down laws like I lay carpet<BR>
Stop it - if you think your gonna make a profit<BR>
<P>
TRANS:<BR>
<P>
</PRE>I enjoy playing my music loudly on my car stereo.  Apparently, women 
enjoy this also because they become sexually aroused when they see me 
driving. Oddly enough, when I visit the Native American reservations, 
some of the more sexually promiscuous Indian women attempt to seduce me 
in their homes. Their intent is to divest me of my earnings.  Such 
actions are unacceptable. 
<P>
<BR>Lyrics:<BR>
Don't see my ones, don't see my guns - get it<BR>
Now tell ya friends Poppa hit it then split it<BR>
In two as I flow with the Junior Mafia<BR>
I don't know what the hell's stoppin' ya<BR>
I'm clockin' ya - Versace shades watchin' ya<BR>
Once ya grin, I'm in game, begin<BR>
<P>
TRANS:<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Understand this fact: you can have neither my money, nor my weapons. 
I suggest that you inform your peers that we engaged in violent sexual 
acts. Currently, I am rapping with my associates, the Junior Mafia.  I'm 
having some difficulty understanding why you refuse to approach me.  I 
am 
attempting to make eye contact with you through my expensive glasses, 
and as soon as you respond with a smile, I will approach you. 
<P>
<BR>Lyrics:<BR>
First I talk about how I dress and this<BR>
And diamond necklaces - stretch Lexuses<BR>
The sex is just immaculate from the back I get<BR>
Deeper and deeper - help ya reach the<BR>
Climax that your man can't make<BR>
Call and tell him you'll be home real late<BR>
Let's sing the break<BR>
<P>
TRANS:<BR>
<P>
</PRE>I prefer to open the conversation with light banter about my 
wardrobe and jewelry, then I like to discuss my collection of expensive 
cars. This is more than enough to convince you to have sexual 
intercourse with me. I am able to insert my penis further into you when I 
enter you from behind. Furthermore, you will be able to reach orgasm.  I 
understand this to be a problem with your current sexual partner.  He 
needn't be concerned about your whereabouts.  Please phone him and inform 
him that you won't be home for a while. By the way, please sing the chorus 
of the song for me also. 
<P>
<BR>Lyrics:<BR>
She's sick of that song on how it's so long<BR>
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz<BR>
There I is - major pain like Damon Wayans<BR>
Low down dirty even like his brother Keenan<BR>
Schemin' - don't bring your girl 'round me<BR>
True player for real, ask Puff Daddy<BR>
<P>
TRANS:<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Your current love interest no longer wishes to hear your 
fabrications about the length of your member.  After I had sexual 
intercourse with your woman, she became enlightened as to the proper way 
it is supposed to be performed; violently and immorally.  It would be in 
your best interest to keep your woman away from me as my sexual prowess 
is very strong.  If you are unconvinced, ask Puff Daddy. 
<P>
<BR>Lyrics:<BR>
You - ringin' bells with bags from Chanel<BR>
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel<BR>
Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell<BR>
She beeped me, meet me at twelve<BR>
<P>
TRANS:<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Despite the fact that you attempted to win her at her doorstep with 
bags full of expensive clothes and a car (the lower end model Mercedes 
Benz which you financed by signing over your current vehicle) containing 
an expensive stereo and a cellular phone, your woman has contacted me 
through my pager indicating that we should rendezvous at midnight. 
<P>
<BR>Lyrics:<BR>
Where you at? Flippin' jobs, playin' car notes?<BR>
While I'm swimmin' in ya women like the breast stroke<BR>
Right stroke, left stroke what's the best stroke<BR>
Death stroke - tongue all down her throat<BR>
Nuthin' left to do but send her home to you<BR>
I'm through - can ya sing the song for me, boo?<BR>
<P>
TRANS:<BR>
<P>
</PRE>You, on the other hand, jump from job to job, barely able to maintain 
payments on the Mercedes Benz you purchased for your woman. Meanwhile, I 
continue to engage in sexual intercourse and commit lewd osculatory acts 
with your women.  My only remaining option is to request that she leave 
my home and return to you because I have reached orgasm and no longer 
have a need for her presence. 
<P>
<BR>Lyrics:<BR>
So, what's it gonna be? Him or me?<BR>
We can cruise the world with pearls<BR>
Gator boots for girls<BR>
The envy of all women, crushed linen<BR>
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in 'em<BR>
The finest women I love with a passion<BR>
Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin'<BR>
<P>
TRANS:<BR>
<P>
</PRE>The ultimate decision rests with you.  Whom do you choose as your 
sexual partner.  I can take you on cruises around the world.  I will 
dress you in the finest jewelry and footwear.  You will be envied by 
women worldwide in your fine clothes and jewelry.  There is a special 
place in my heart for beautiful women.  I will defeat your man in an 
altercation because he is effeminate. 
<P>
<BR>Lyrics:<BR>
High fashion - flyin' into all states.<BR>
Sexin' me while your man masturbates.<BR>
Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight.<BR>
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds.<BR>
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent.<BR>
I'm not only the client, I'm the player president<BR>
<P>
TRANS:<BR>
<P>
</PRE>You will be dressed in finest clothes on the runways of Paris.  I 
will fly you to every state to shop for fine clothes and jewelry.  You 
will enjoy sexual intercourse with me and your man will be forced to 
pleasure himself through manual stimulation.  What a life!  I'll return 
you to LaGuardia in time to catch your 8 o'clock flight.  The timing is 
perfect because I have scheduled a date with a second woman who arrives 
at the same gate at 9 o'clock.  I'll seduce her in the same way that I 
seduced you.  I rap well and I am a positive reflection of my home 
town.  Not only am I a sexually deviant, misogynistic, immoral, wealthy, 
male prostitute, but I also sit on the board of directors of the 
organization that governs others of my kind. 
<P>
