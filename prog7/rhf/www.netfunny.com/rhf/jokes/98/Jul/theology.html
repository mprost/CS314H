</PRE>THEOLOGICAL ENGINEERING EXAM  5 Questions, 60 Minutes. 
<P>
You may use a calculator, the Bible, the Koran, the Torah, and the Book of 
Mormon. The speed of light is c. Show all work. For all problems, assume a 
perfectly spherical Jesus of constant density D. No praying during the exam. 
<P>
1. (20 pts.) Bob and Joe are standing on a street corner. God loves each an 
equal amount L_0. Bob then accelerates to .9c. In Joe's rest frame, how much 
does God now love Bob? 
<P>
2. Sven, a Catholic, is in a state of grace. He then has sex with sheep S. 
a. (8 pts.) What is Sven's atonement coefficient following the act if the 
sheep was not willing? 
b. (12 pts.) What if the sheep, while not technically being willing, could 
not be said to mind either? 
<P>
3. (20 pts.) Let the eternal, all abiding love of the Holy Spirit be the xy 
plane. Let Sue's soul be at (0,0,5) at t = 0 sec., traveling at 5 m/s in the 
direction of the positive z axis. Everything is in Cartesian coordinates 
bespeaking subscription to a perfectly rational Enlightenment attitude 
towards the Universe. At what time t will Sue be saved? 
(Hint: Assume a point soul.) 
<P>
4. (20 pts.) Assume the Rapture occurs at time t. Cornelia, a saved human 
weighing 90 kg, in a state of grace, has her head in the closing jaws of an 
alligator at time t. What mass of meat will remain to the alligator at time 
t + 10 sec.? 
<P>
5. Stan is a frictionless, massless Mormon in a rest state. His sin level 
for his faith is currently 11 McBeals. He eats .3 kg of pork, and enjoys it 
very much. Assume that the Jews are right about, well, pretty much everything. 
a. (10 pts.) What is Stan's sin level now? 
b. (10 pts.)Stan is one of them Salt Lake City Mormons. He ain't so damn 
smug now, is he? 
<P>
Extra Credit (10 pts): 25 grams of wafers and 20 ml of cheap wine undergo 
transubstantiation and become the flesh and blood of our Lord. How many 
Joules of heat are released by the transformation? 
<P>
Hand in exam when done, and may God have mercy on your work. 
<P>
