<P>
</PRE>1. In a recent exchange of correspondence between Commander, Puget Sound 
Naval Shipyard and the Chief, Bureau of Ships, the Commander, Puget Sound Naval 
Shipyard on the basis of complaints by U.S.S. GRIDLEY (DLG-21) and U.S.S. 
REEVES (DLG-24), recommended that in future construction the urinals be 
installed at a height of 26 inches above the deck rather than the specified 
23 inches. In response to the recommendation, the Chief, Bureau of Ships 
stated that the evidence cited did not justify a departure from the approved 
specifications on the height of urinal installation. 
<P>
2.   Since the original recommendation was made partly on the basis of 
complaints by GRIDLEY personnel and since there is an indication that 
GRIDLEY's complaint was not adequately justified, GRIDLEY has caused a more 
thorough inquiry into the facts. 
<P>
3.   A survey of ship's company has revealed that the tallest man in the 
crew is 6'6" and the shortest is 5'4." In a dry run, these two men have been 
posed at the urinals, at their present height of 23," and it has been 
determined that the tallest man has 15 inches clearance and the shortest 4 
inches.  Although GRIDLEY completely concurs in the desireablity of fully 
documenting its recommendations it is considered that photographs may be, in 
this instance, omitted due to the delicacy of the subject. At any rate, it 
may be seen from the above figures that even the shortest man in the crew 
would still have one inch clearance if the urinals were mounted 3 inches 
higher. Let there be no thought that there is anything wrong with GRIDLEY's 
marksmanship. We can hit them, but it must be realized that the longer the 
drop in flow, the higher the head and consequently the greater the splash. 
Splash is the nemesis of sanitation. 
<P>
4.   From GRIDLEY's measurements and from information gleaned from the 
almanac that the average height of the American male is increasing, it is 
cleqr to GRIDLEY that the urinals are too low and should be raised. It 
appears that the fault lies in the change in the type urinal and possibly 
the change in height of the average man since the specifications were 
written and that there is no truth to the rumor that the man in BUSHIPS in 
charge of writing specifications for urinal heights is a midget and short 
coupled at that. 
<P>
5.   A change in specifications for future ships is earnestly recommended.

<P>
</PRE>1.  In response to reference (a), reference (b, (c) and (d) have dealt with 
the subject at length and should clearly indicate to the Commanding Officer, 
USS GRIDLEY, that the Chief, Bureau of Ships has by no means taken a 
hands-off stand in this matter. 
<P>
2. In view of the delicate nature of the situation, considerable time and 
effort, both in-house and out, was directed at the subject. From this steady 
stream of information, the current Bureau Specification of 23" has been 
found to compare favorably with maritime, aviation and other industrial 
standards.  Domestic engineering standards give the installed height of 
urinal lip as 20" to 21." The Crane Company catalog shows the height as 
22."  Although a unique relationshipo developed earlier by USS REEVES 
(DLG-24) between bowl size and trajectory appears valid, there is no known 
cure for splash.  Habit, experience and care will minimize but not eliminate 
this problem regardless of a man's height relative to that of the urinal. 
<P>
3.  Based on the above, I feel that we are on firm if not dry ground with 
our current specification. A review of the suitablity of the smaller 
vitreous china urinal will be made prior to next standard plans revision. In 
the interim, it is suggested that you utilize the technique recommended by 
the Fire Chief from Wichita Falls--if you can't stand closer to the fire, 
reel out more hose.
