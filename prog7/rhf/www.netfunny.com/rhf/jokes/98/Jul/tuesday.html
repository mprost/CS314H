</PRE>I don't know how it happened, but at Tel Aviv airport three men got 
talking, a Christian, a Muslim, and a Jew.  They were discussing the 
airport security, when the Christian broached the subject of religion. The 
Jew and the Muslim listened with cynical smiles as he told his story. 
<P>
"I was brought up with God's Word," said the Christian, "But it was never 
until I really came into trouble that I learned to really trust in Jesus. 
I was flying from this very airport, bound for Chile, when it happened. We 
were flying over the Sahara desert, you see, and that was before there 
were weather satellites.  We ran into one helluva storm-- there was sand 
everywhere. One of the turbines cut out, it had been destroyed by the 
flying sand.  Well, gentlemen, I prayed like I had never prayed before.  I 
prayed, Lord Jesus help me get out of this alive.  And d'you know what 
happened? Suddenly, a big gap appeared in the storm.  For two miles around 
the storm subsided, and the air was clear.  I thank the Lord that we 
safely returned to Tel Aviv airport, although I never did make it to 
Chile." 
<P>
The Muslim did not usually talk about religion, but he was not to be 
outdone.  He recalled an incident over the Gobi desert.  "When I and my 
family were flying from Kazakhstan to Pakistan a few years back, a 
remarkably similar incident occurred.  We were in the midst of a 
*terrible* storm, and the cabin crew had given up hope.  I stood in the 
aisle and prayed to Allah, and of course we were saved.  The storm 
suddenly cleared, and for miles around there was nothing but clear blue 
sky.  It just goes to show that you should always trust in God." 
<P>
The Jew, as fate would have it, had had a similar experience.  "I was 
driving across the Negev desert one day when my car broke down.  It was 
the worst place it could have happened, as there were no towns or villages 
as far as the eye could see, and the sun was beating down.  Well, I did 
the only thing there was to do.  I waited in my car for someone to come 
who could take me to town.  Soon enough, someone came along.  I got out of 
my car and waved, but they didn't stop.  They just drove on by.  But about 
a hundred yards down the road I saw them throw something out of their car. 
I went to see what it was, and what do you think?  It was a suitcase full 
of money!  It had broken and the money was blowing about...  all 
banknotes, no coins!  But it was the Lord's day, and being a religious Jew 
I couldn't pick it up.  I prayed to God, 'Just this one time, God, 
remember me.  You know how I've remembered you for all these years. 
Something for me this time, God?' And for ten miles around, it was 
Tuesday."
