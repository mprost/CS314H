<BR>THE TRAGIC COMEDIE OF KING LEER<BR>
<P>
Scene 1.  A forest glen.  Enter Witch Tripp and Kenneth of Starr.<BR>
<P>
Witch Tripp:<BR>
Double, double, Webster Hubbell, I think I got the Creep in trouble.<BR>
Eye of Newt, strap of bra, Could it be he broke some law?<BR>
<P>
Praise this broth utmost ephemeral,<BR>
Heavens!  I left out my Essence of Emeril!<BR>
Hark!  Who trespasses so near?<BR>
<P>
Kenneth of Starr:<BR>
Tis I, the Inquisitor.  What news?<BR>
<P>
Witch Tripp:<BR>
Things proceed with quickening speed, m'lord.  The maiden Lewinsky, so<BR>
deeply embroil'd, is now join'd by the Lady Willey in like pursuit.  Daily<BR>
tightens the noose around the king.<BR>
<P>
Starr:<BR>
Would that it were so, but he hath good counsel, and more moves than a<BR>
chess board.  His public, well pleas'd with good news of the economie, doth<BR>
o'erlook much.<BR>
<P>
Witch Tripp:<BR>
How may I serve you next?<BR>
<P>
Starr:<BR>
I have need of acts damnable and facts verifiable.  Else he may elude me<BR>
yet.<BR>
<P>
Witch Tripp:<BR>
His dog Buddy, freshly neuter'd, may bear his master harsh reproach.  He<BR>
may consent to wearing a collar of our invention, to survey the king at his<BR>
ease. Dogs are much accustom'd to insects.  What's one more bug?<BR>
<P>
Starr:<BR>
Good hag, I rely on you completely.  I must away.<BR>
<P>
(Exeunt Tripp and Starr)<BR>
<P>
Scene 2.  The king's antechamber<BR>
<P>
Duke of McCurry:<BR>
My Lord!  I needs must speak with you most urgently!  The castle is<BR>
assaulted on all sides!<BR>
<P>
Leer:<BR>
What would I not give for an hour's peace!<BR>
<P>
McCurry:<BR>
An army of reporters is settled at thy gate.  They are press in name and<BR>
press in deed, for they press me daily, nay, hourly for some explanation<BR>
from thy lips.<BR>
<P>
Leer:<BR>
Who is there among them?<BR>
<P>
McCurry:<BR>
Lords Jennings, Brokaw, Rather, Geraldo of Rivera and a host of others.<BR>
Methinks I spied the van from Hard Copy.<BR>
<P>
Leer:<BR>
You cut me to the quick.  Do they not know that I am chaste?<BR>
<P>
McCurry:<BR>
They insinuate that thou hast chased too often.<BR>
<P>
Leer:<BR>
Never have lies been so artfully stack'd against a pure soul.<BR>
Where is Lady Hillary?<BR>
<P>
McCurry:<BR>
Her secretary doth report that she is lock'd in her bath, saying over and<BR>
over, "Why can I not wash my hands of this guy?"<BR>
<P>
Leer:<BR>
Oh cursed fate!  I must be the most solitary mortal in all creation.<BR>
Never have I betrayed m'lady's trust.<BR>
<P>
McCurry:<BR>
Whatever.<BR>
<P>
(Enter Messenger)<BR>
<P>
Messenger:<BR>
Good king, steel thy nerve.  I bring a missive from Kenneth of Starr, the<BR>
Grand Inquisitor.<BR>
<P>
Leer:<BR>
Was ever a man as Starr-cross'd as I?  Why does this man conspire to<BR>
afflict me thus?  My hand is unsteady.  Read it to me.<BR>
<P>
Messenger:<BR>
<P>
Let me see.  He offers you his regards, blah, blah, blah, then doth<BR>
subpoena you to appear at his chamber at Friday next, to forswear again<BR>
that thou tookst no liberties with the Jones wench, who withdraweth not<BR>
her claims against you.<BR>
<P>
Leer:<BR>
I have already so sworn!<BR>
<P>
McCurry:<BR>
It would seem, m'lord, that the woeful tale of Lady Willey rekindles old<BR>
flames.<BR>
<P>
Leer:<BR>
I kiss'd the woman on the forehead, as a sign of my regard.  Never was a<BR>
king so expos'd!<BR>
<P>
McCurry:<BR>
Truer words were ne'er spoken.<BR>
<P>
Leer:<BR>
I cannot think on't further.  Leave me to my own counsel.<BR>
<P>
(Exeunt Messenger and McCurry)<BR>
<P>
Leer:<BR>
To be forthright, or not to be forthright, that is the question.  Whether<BR>
'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous<BR>
fortune, or just bag the whole thing and teach law at a junior college.<BR>
<P>
(Enter Courtier)<BR>
<P>
Courtier:<BR>
My liege, you are late for an appointed meeting.<BR>
<P>
Leer:<BR>
What's this?<BR>
<P>
Courtier:<BR>
You were to interview a new assistant at the stroke of two.  She seems<BR>
most  capable, and with rare intellect for one so young and fair.<BR>
<P>
Leer:<BR>
Well, tell her I will see her anon, and on, and on.<BR>
<P>
Courtier:<BR>
A most clever jest, my king.<BR>
<P>
Leer:<BR>
Let us not tarry further.<BR>
<P>
(Exeunt Leer and Courtier.  Enter Buddy, from behind a chair)<BR>
<P>
Buddy:<BR>
So dearest reader, I bid adieu.<BR>
Me seeth I have much to do.<BR>
And so it comes to this pretty pass<BR>
To see if the king doth get some . . . class.<BR>
<P>
