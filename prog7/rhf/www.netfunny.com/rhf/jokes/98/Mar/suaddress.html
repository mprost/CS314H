</PRE>THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS ... 
THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON <B>SHOULD</B> HAVE GIVEN 
<P>
"Members of Congress... people of America .... I banged her. 
I banged her like a cheap gong.  Which is not news, folks, because if 
you think Monica Lewinsky was the only skin flute player in my 
orchestra, you haven't been paying attention. The only babes in D.C. I 
HAVEN'T tried to do are the First Lady, Reno, Albright, and Shalala, 
mostly because they're a little  older than I like and they have legs 
that former Houston Oiler Earl Campbell would envy. Which isn't to say 
I don't appreciate Hillary...I do.  If not for the ice- water coursing 
through her veins, I'd be pumping gas into farm equipment in Hope, 
Arkansas, and she'd be married to the President. So, let me set the 
record straight.  I dodged the draft, hid FBI files, smoked dope, 
flipped Whitewater property, set up a new Chinese wing in the White 
House, fired the travel staff, paid hush money to Hubbell, sold the 
Lincoln bedroom like an upscale Motel 6, and grabbed every ass that 
entered the Oval Office.  Got it? Good. 
<P>
Six years ago, there was not a man, woman, or child who didn't know 
I was as horny as Woody Allen.  But, you elected me anyway, which 
turned out to be a good move on your part.  Your other choice was 
Bush, an aging baseball player and part-time resident of some place 
called "Kennebunkport" who thought he could bomb his way into the 
White House.  Before him, it was Reagan, who left the office with the 
same Alzheimer's he came in with, and left the country with the 
biggest deficit ever. Then there was Carter before him who brought you 
a a 17% prime interest rate, smiling the whole time like his lithium 
drip had just kicked in.  Nixon before that coined, but never really 
understood, the concept of 'plausible deniability,' and got a one-way 
ticket to San Clemente for his crackerjack style of governing. Johnson 
was an inbred, power-mad war criminal whose major contribution to 
American society was Agent Orange.  And John Kennedy, who was a little 
naughty himself, didn't hang around long enough for America to spot 
that curious atavistic tic for "beaver- wrestling" shared by at least 
a dozen former residents of the White House. 
<P>
Which brings me back to my point. Since I have been strumming the 
banjo here at the White House, government is doing more for less.  The 
budget is balanced for the first time since JFK did a one gun salute 
to Marilyn, a fact the press didn't seem to care about, evidently. 
Unemployment is so low today a blind felon can get a job as a 
night-watchman. The stock market is higher than a D-student on a full 
gram of dumb-dust, and anyone with a degree from a junior college who 
can spell 'internet' has enough money to ponder the annual maintenance 
cost of his boat, instead of where his or her next meal is coming 
from. Bottom line: I'm running a country here and I'm doing it with my 
pecker showing. What I'm asking for is your support, not a date with 
your daughter ... unless, of course, she's a hotty with thin ankles, 
and then I'd like to discuss it.  In the meantime, think about where 
you are today and what kind of life you're living, before you get too 
interested in where I'm parking the Presidential limousine."
