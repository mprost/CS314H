</PRE>This lovely little girl was entering class for the first time. A 
friendly little boy said his name was "David, what is yours?" "Happy 
Butt" she says.  "Don't lie to me, that isn't your name! What is your 
name?" "Happy Butt" she says again. "I'm going to tell the teacher on 
you for lying!" he shouts. 
<P>
He gets the teacher and says she is lying to him about her name.  "What 
is your name?" asks the teacher. "Happy Butt" says the little girl. 
"No, no," says the teacher. "What is your real name?" "Happy Butt" 
replies the little girl. "Shame on you for lying." says the teacher. 
"You go straight to the principal's office right this minute!" 
<P>
"Why are you here?" asks the principal of the little girl. "They think 
I'm lying when I tell them my name is Happy Butt." said the little 
girl.  "Your name can't be Happy Butt" says the principal. "I'm going to 
call your mother right this minute and straighten this out. You mustn't 
lie to us about your name." 
<P>
The principal calls the mother and says, "We have your little girl here 
and she keeps telling us her name is 'Happy Butt.'" "Oh, that must be 
Gladys," says the mother. 
<P>
"Well, little girl, your mother says your name is Gladys," says the 
principal. The little girl replies, "Happy Butt, Glad ass, what's the 
difference?"
