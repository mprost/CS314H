</PRE>Real stories from Flight Attendants apologizing for rough transport on 
the airlines..... 
<P>
Upon landing hard, the pilot gets on the PA system, "Sorry folks for the 
hard landing. It wasn't the pilot's fault, and it wasn't the plane's 
fault. It was the asphalt." 
<P>
An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered 
his ship into the runway really hard. The airline had a policy which 
required the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers 
exited, give a smile, and a "Thanks for flying XYZ airline." He said 
that in light of his bad landing, he had a hard time looking the 
passengers in the eye, thinking that someone would have a smart comment. 
Finally everyone had gotten off except for this little old lady walking 
with a cane.  She said, "Sonny, mind if I ask you a question?" "Why no 
Ma'am,"  said the pilot, "what is it?" The little old lady said, "Did we 
land or were we shot down?" 
<P>
From a disgruntled Southwest Airlines employee.... "Welcome aboard 
Southwest Flight XXX, to YYY. To operate your seatbelt, insert the metal 
tab into the buckle, and pull tight. It works just like every other 
seatbelt, and if you don't know how to operate one, you probably 
shouldn't be out in public unsupervised. In the event of a sudden loss 
of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will descend from the ceiling. Stop 
screaming, grab the mask, and pull it over your face. If you have a 
small child traveling with you, secure your mask before assisting with 
theirs. If you are traveling with two small children, decide now which 
one you love more.  Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some 
broken clouds, but they'll try to have them fixed before we arrive. 
Thank you, and remember, noboby loves you, or your money, more than 
Southwest Airlines." 
<P>
United Airlines FA: "Ladies and Gentlemen, as you are all now painfully 
aware, our Captain has landed in Seattle. From all of us at United 
Airlines we'd like to thank you for flying with us today and please be 
very careful as you open the overhead bins as you may be killed by 
falling luggage that shifted during our so called "touch down." 
<P>
About 5 or 6 years ago I was on an American Airlines flight into 
Amarillo, Texas, on a particularly windy and bumpy day.  I could tell 
during the final that the Captain was really having to fight it, and 
after an extremely hard landing, the Flight Attendant came on the PA and 
announced, "Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo. Please remain in 
your seats with your seatbelts fastened while the Captain taxis what's 
left of our airplane to the gate!" 
<P>
Another flight Attendant's comment on a less than perfect landing: "We 
ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the 
terminal." 
<P>
Landing: a controlled mid-air collision with a planet.
