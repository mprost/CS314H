</PRE>It is reported that the following edition of the Book of Genesis 
was discovered in the Dead Seal Scrolls. 
<P>
And Adam said, "Lord, when I was in the garden, you walked with me 
everyday. Now I do not see you anymore.  I am lonesome here and it 
is difficult for me to remember how much you love me." 
<P>
And God said, "No problem!  I will create a companion for you that 
will be with you forever and who will be a reflection of my love for you, 
so that you will know I love you, even when you cannot see me. 
<P>
Regardless of how selfish and childish and unlovable you may be, this new 
companion will accept you as you are and will love you as I do, in spite of 
yourself." 
<P>
And God created a new animal to be a companion for Adam. And it was 
a good animal.  And God was pleased. 
<P>
And the new animal was pleased to be with Adam and he wagged his 
tail. And Adam said, "But Lord, I have already named all the animals in 
the Kingdom and all the good names are taken and I cannot think of a 
name for this new animal." 
<P>
And God said, "No problem!  Because I have created this new animal 
to be a reflection of my love for you, his name will be a reflection of my 
own name, and you will call him DOG." 
<P>
And Dog lived with Adam and was a companion to him and loved him. 
And Adam was comforted.  And God was pleased. And Dog was content and 
wagged his tail. 
<P>
After a while, it came to pass that Adam's guardian angel came to 
the Lord and said, "Lord, Adam has become filled with pride. He struts 
and preens like a peacock and he believes he is worthy of adoration.  Dog 
has indeed taught him that he is loved, but no one has taught him 
humility." 
<P>
And the Lord said, "No problem! I will create for him a companion 
who will be with him forever and who will see him as he is.  The 
companion will remind him of his limitations, so he will know that he is not 
worthy of adoration." 
<P>
And God created CAT to be a companion to Adam.  And Cat would not 
obey Adam. 
<P>
And when Adam gazed into Cat's eyes, he was reminded that he was not 
the supreme being. And Adam learned humility. 
<P>
And God was pleased.  And Adam was greatly improved. 
<P>
And Cat did not care one way or the other.
