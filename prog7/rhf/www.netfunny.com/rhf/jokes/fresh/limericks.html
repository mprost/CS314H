<PRE>darus@mcs.com (Jim Wygralak) wrote in rec.humor.funny:
&gt;
&gt;A friend of mine came up with this one and gave me permission to submit &gt;it, saying he wanted to be attributed by his initials, EFS, only.
&gt;
&gt;There once was a man from the stix,
&gt;Who liked to write limerics.
&gt;But he failed at the sport,
&gt;Because he wrote them too short.
&gt;

Ah yes. Jokes on limerick length. I remember seeing the following two 
similar jokes in OMNI magazine back in the early 80's, though I don't 
know where they got them:

===
There once was a lady from Crewe
Whose limerics went to line two.
---
There once was a man from Verdun.
===

Thus inspired, my brother Scott and I set about making joke limericks for 
3, 4, and 6 lines. If memory serves:

===
There once was a lady from Bree
Whose limericks went to line three,
And never went farther.
---
There once was a man on the floor
Whose limericks went to line four.
He'd start up the trend,
and then it would end.
---
There once was a man from the Styx
Whose limericks went to line six.
He never did know
How far they should go,
And never did bother to fix
Them at all.
===

Of course, you can joke on things that aren't length:

===
There once was a man with a dime
Who wrote limericks some of the time.
He wrote just a bit,
But they sounded like s___
'Cuz he never could get them to sound right.
