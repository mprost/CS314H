<PRE>
An amazing discovery was made today when land was found under the snow in 
Dayton, Ohio.  Although there have been rumors for several weeks that there 
was actual ground under the snow, most residents were sceptical because 
there was no real evidence to back up these claims.

However, after the third grueling day of temperatures above freezing, enough 
snow had melted so that patches of earth showed through.  Initially, it was 
thought that these dark patches were just a new form of snow, but scientists 
from Ohio State University have verified that this is actual dirt.

Long time residents in the area were not suprised because they claimed they 
could remember back to when the ground was not snow covered.  Historians are 
going back through the archives in the Dayton library to discover when the 
ground was last seen.

Based on the evidence, several retailers in the area have announced plans to 
add new products, such as lawn mowers and gardening tools, to their 
inventory.  Other retailers are taking a wait-and-see attitude to see if the 
ground will actually be visible enough to justify expanding their line of 
merchandise.
