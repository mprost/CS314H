PHOENIX, AZ--Scientists have discovered a tendency for lab rats 
to commit suicide after being exposed to the Judas Priest album 
"Sin After Sin."   During the tests rats were provided with two 
piles of cheese.  One pile was normal cheese.  The other pile was 
laced with rat poison and had a sign above clearly indicating the 
consequences of eating from that pile.  After just three playings 
of the album at a volume of 130 decibels, a stunning 50% of the 
rats had consumed a fatal dose of cheese from the rat poison 
pile.   After 10 playings almost 90% of the rats were dead.   By 
the time the album had been played 23 times all the rats in the 
experiment had committed suicide. 
<P>
The test used 1013 rats and was funded by the plaintiffs 
in the Judas Priest suicide trial currently underway in Arizona. 
The results of this experiment were immediately rushed to the 
Parent's Music Resource Center headquarters in Washington, 
DC.  The results will be presented to Congress by the PMRC on 
Friday in an effort to fund a $75 million followup to this 
experiment testing the effects on rats of the music of Ozzy 
Osbourne, Metallica, Black Sabbath, W.A.S.P., Blue Oyster Cult, 
Aerosmith, Megadeath, Motley Crue, 2 Live Crew, Ratt, Twisted 
Sister, Mentors, Woody Guthrie, and other controversial heavy 
metal bands.
