The lovely explanation of how to identify a programming language by 
its effects, missed a few languages.  Herewith: 
<P>
<!--  points-->
<DL>
<P>
<DT>FORTRAN:<DD> 
You shoot yourself in each toe, iteratively, until you run out 
of toes, then you read in the next foot and repeat.  If you run 
out of bullets, you continue anyway because you have no exception 
processing ability. 
<P>
<DT>Algol:<DD> 
You shoot yourself in the foot with a musket.  The musket is 
aesthetically fascinating, and the wound baffles the adolescent 
medic in the emergency room. 
<P>
<DT>COBOL:<DD> 
USEing a COLT45 HANDGUN, AIM gun at LEG.FOOT, THEN place 
ARM.HAND.FINGER on HANDGUN.TRIGGER, and SQUEEZE. THEN 
return HANDGUN to HOLSTER.  Check whether shoelace needs 
to be retied. 
<P>
<DT>BASIC:<DD> 
Shoot self in foot with water pistol.  On big systems, continue 
until entire lower body is waterlogged. 
<P>
<DT>PL/I:<DD> 
You consume all available system resources, including all the 
offline bullets.  The DataProcessing &amp; Payroll Department doubles 
its size, triples its budget, acquires four new mainframes, and 
drops the original one on your foot. 
<P>
<DT>SNOBOL:<DD> 
You grab your foot with your hand, then rewrite your hand to 
be a bullet.  The act of shooting the original foot then 
changes your hand/bullet into yet another foot (a left foot). 
<P>
<DT>lisp:<DD> 
You shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun with 
which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun 
with which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the 
gun with which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds... 
<P>
<DT>scheme:<DD> 
You shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun with 
which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun 
with which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the 
gun with which you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds... 
...but none of the other appendages are aware of this happening. 
<P>
<DT>English:<DD> 
You put your foot in your mouth, then bite it off. 
</DL>
