This is from the british-cars@alliant.com mailing list. 
<P>
My SO found this in the July 1990 Reader's Digest: 
<STRONG>[Ed: I heard it much prior to that, though]</STRONG> 
<P>
An MG Midget pulled alongside a Rolls-Royce at a traffic light. 
"Do you have a car phone?" its driver asked the guy in the Rolls. 
<P>
"Of course I do," replied the haughty deluxe-car driver. 
<P>
"Well, do you have a fax machine?" 
<P>
The driver in the Rolls sighed.  "I have that too." 
<P>
"Then do you have a double bed in the back?" the Midget driver 
wanted to know. 
<P>
Ashen-faced, the Rolls driver sped off.  That afternoon, he had a 
mechanic install a double bed in his auto. 
<P>
A week later, the Rolls driver passes the same MG Midget, which is 
parked on the side of the road--back windows fogged up and steam 
pouring out.  The arrogant driver pulls over, gets out of the Rolls 
and bangs on the Midget's back window until the driver sticks his head 
out.  "I want you to know that I had a double bed installed," brags 
the Rolls driver. 
<P>
The Midget driver is unimpressed.  "You got me out of the shower to 
tell me that?" 
<P>
