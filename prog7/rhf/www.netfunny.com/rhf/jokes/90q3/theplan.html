<STRONG>[Ed: This is one of those ones that I never liked, but people keep sending 
me versions of it with great regularity.  I hope posting this makes them 
stop.  On the other hand, I still get "Mouse Balls" and "Agnostic Dyslexics" 
at least once a week.]</STRONG> 
<P>
In the beginning was the Plan 
<P>
And then came the Assumptions 
<P>
And the Assumptions were without form 
<P>
And the Plan was completely without substance 
<P>
And the Darkness was on the faces of the Employees 
<P>
And they spoke unto their Supervisors saying 
<P>
"It's a Crock of Shit and it Stinketh!" 
<P>
And the Supervisors went unto their Department Heads and sayeth 
<P>
"It's a Pail of Dung, and none may abide the Odor thereof." 
<P>
And the Department Heads went unto their Managers, and sayeth 
unto them 
<P>
"It is a Container of Excrement, and it is very strong, such that 
none may abide by it." 
<P>
And the Managers went unto their Director and sayeth 
<P>
"It is a Vessel of Fertilizer, and none may abide its Strength." 
<P>
And the Director went unto the Vice President and sayeth 
<P>
"It contains that which aids Plant Growth, and it is very Strong." 
<P>
And the Vice President went to the Executive Vice President and 
sayeth 
<P>
"It promoteth Growth, and it is very Powerful." 
<P>
And the Executive Vice President went to the President and sayeth 
<P>
"This Powerful New Plan will actively promote the Growth and 
Efficiency of the System." 
<P>
And the President looked upon the Plan and saw that it was Good 
<P>
And the Plan became Policy
