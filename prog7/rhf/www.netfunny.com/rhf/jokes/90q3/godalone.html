(I don't know where this joke comes from originally; I heard it from 
my father, who says he heard it many years ago and doesn't remember 
from whom.) 
<P>
A farmer purchases an old, run-down, abandoned farm with plans 
to turn it into a thriving enterprise.  The fields are grown over with 
weeds, the farmhouse is falling apart, and the fences are collapsing 
all around. 
<P>
During his first day of work, the town preacher stops by to 
bless the man's work, saying, "May you and God work together to make 
this the farm of your dreams!" 
<P>
A few months later, the preacher stops by again to call on the 
farmer.  Lo and behold, it's like a completely different place--the 
farm house is completely rebuilt and in excellent condition, there is 
plenty of cattle and other livestock happily munching on feed in 
well-fenced pens, and the fields are filled with crops planted in neat 
rows.  "Amazing!" the preacher says.  "Look what God and you have 
accomplished together!" 
<P>
"Yes, reverend," says the farmer, "but remember what the farm 
was like when God was working it alone!" 
<P>
