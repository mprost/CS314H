<BR>Amazon.com review: Green Eggs and Ham, by Dr. Seuss<BR>
(5-stars) Resistance is Futile... You will be Assimilated, February 7, 2004<BR>
Reviewer: mad-haus (see more about me) from Silicon Valley, CA USA<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Green Eggs and Ham is more than a simple children's tale of the need to 
try new foods. It is a disturbing glimpse at the Cold War forces that 
made Eisenhower-era America the stifling society it was, a nightmare for 
the creative and intellectual classes. 
<P>
It begins with an Everyman innocently reading in, we should presume, his 
own home. A stranger runs past him with a wooden sign announcing that he 
is Sam. Our protagonist recognizes he is the victim of a home invasion, 
but like so many restrained Updike males, is unable to voice his 
objection to his domestic tranquility being shattered, other than to 
utter a powerless plea that he doesn't care for this Sam character. 
<P>
Sam, having taken the upper hand, moves beyond in-your-face picketing 
(note the clever denigration of peace activists by this introduction) 
and will now force our hero to eat some offensive looking victuals: meat 
clearly in the advanced stages of rot, and eggs to match. There is a 
suggestion that the spineless victim brought this upon himself by hiding 
from society, engaging in anti-American activity by reading books. The 
reader is left to ponder whether the victim is a Communist, or at the 
very least a vegetarian. For this reason, Sam, cleverly named to 
represent the consensus view of these United States, must prevail. 
<P>
The victim's protests are many, his attempts at evasion numerous. 
Leaving the safety of his home only increases his discomfort; he is 
forced to endure the company of several possibly rabid mammals, all 
while Sam keeps shoving the unwanted offal in his face. While he has 
removed the irrepressible Sam from his house, he must also deal with 
roller-coaster rides into the water, while getting rained on and being 
forced to climb a tree; none of these being interests of your typical 
egghead. As the story moves along, the reader feels less and less 
sympathy for the victim, blaming his situation on his nonconformity, 
even if the society of those who wish him to eat rotten animal products 
are animals themselves. 
<P>
The presumptive lesson of this book is that one must conform to social 
pressure, or even worse things will happen. This fable is an important 
lesson for today, with so many anti-intellectual messages coming from 
both government and media. Viewed in its proper context, we see it as a 
cautionary tale of a hellishly restrictive society that is back with a 
vengeance. 
<P>
