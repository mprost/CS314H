<P>
</PRE>Told to me by a friend with kids in elementary school. 
<P>
The administration of this particular elementary school decided to start a 
more inclusive policy on which words were "bad" words. Among those initiated 
to the category was "suck" (when not referring to the principle of suction). 
<P>
One day a child came up to the teacher to inform her that one of the other 
students had said a bad word. 
<P>
"What was the bad word he said?" asked the teacher. 
<P>
"I can't say it." 
<P>
"It's ok to tell me, you won't get in trouble for it." 
<P>
"No, it's too bad, I don't want to say it" 
<P>
"Well I have to know what he said in order to punish him. Can you tell me what 
it is without saying it?" 
<P>
"Well... it rhymes with 'fuck'"
