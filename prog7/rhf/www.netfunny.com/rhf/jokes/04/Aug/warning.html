</PRE>WASHINGTON - Al-Qaida may attempt to launch attacks in U.S. cities 
using Democratic Party campaign trains, airplanes, or buses packed 
with explosives as weapons, the FBI said in a new nationwide bulletin. 
<P>
Terror operatives could attempt to hijack Democratic party campaign 
vehicles and use them in suicide attacks against buildings, parades, 
sporting events, or political rallies, said the intelligence bulletin. 
<P>
The Democratic banners could both help terrorists get closer to 
targeted buildings, the FBI warning said.  The warning was sent 
Monday night by the FBI and the Homeland Security Department to 18,000 
state and local law enforcement agencies, other government officials 
and private groups. 
<P>
"Democratic Party activities are excellent cover for people with 
colored skin or heads covered in rags," the FBI bulletin said.  "Those 
sorts of people would obviously stick out driving a Republican Party 
vehicle.  We realize the Democratic Party is legal and allowed to use 
vehicles, but we want people to be cautions around them.  Billboards 
with Democratic Party political ads could also be used by terrorists 
as shields to hide behind." 
<P>
A Democratic Party spokesperson responded to the warning, saying 
"Someone carrying a gun would be out of place next to a Democratic 
Party vehicle, but a person with an assault rifle would seem natural 
next to a Republican Party banner.  The Democratic Party does, 
however, support the hard-working FBI agents in the fight against 
global terror." 
<P>
In response to questions on whether the FBI announcement was political 
White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan denied any political motive. 
<P>
"There is nothing political in this announcement.  This is also not a 
personal attack on waffle-man and his best boy--this announcement 
applies equally to all local, state, and national Democratic candidates." 
<P>
