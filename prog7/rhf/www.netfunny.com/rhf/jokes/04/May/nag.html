</PRE>An attorney returned home late one evening after a very taxing day trying 
to get a stay of execution for a client, named Wilbur Wright, who was due 
to be hanged for murder at midnight. His last minute plea for clemency 
to the state governor had failed and he was feeling tired and depressed. 
As soon as he got through the door his wife started on about, "What time 
of night do you call this? Where the heck have you been?" Too shattered to 
play his usual role in this familiar ritual, he went and poured himself 
a very large whisky and headed off to the bathroom for a long hot soak - 
pursued by his wife's sarcastic remarks. 
<P>
While he was in the bath the phone rang, which the wife answered - to 
be told that her husband's client had been granted his stay of execution 
after all. Realizing what a day he must have had, she relented a little 
and went upstairs to give him the good news. As she opened the bathroom 
door she was greeted by the sight of her husband's rear view as he bent 
naked over the bath cleaning the tub. "They're not hanging Wright tonight," 
she said, at which the attorney whirled round and screamed hysterically, 
"For crying out loud woman, don't you ever stop?"
