</PRE>There's a stream that runs through the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign campus called Boneyard Stream, which varies from an idyllic 
babbling brook to an open-air sewage line.  Students joke that one will mutate 
into a hideous monster if you touch the "water."  Closer to the sewage end 
of it, a group of grad students were playing frisbee.  The frisbee happened 
to be a gift from the distant boyfriend of one of the students, and thus had 
sentimental value.  Upon considering their proximity to the vile stream, 
she warned them to be careful with her special frisbee.  The student who 
had the frisbee at the moment scoffed at this, and right on cue, a gust of 
wind carried it into the stream.  He looked on in horror, but realized that 
he was going to have to wade into the Boneyard to retrieve it. 
<P>
One of the others who were playing frisbee saw what he was about to do, 
and tried to talk him out of it.  "Hey, let's not be too hasty." he said. 
"Let's follow it downstream a few miles of so and then maybe we can reason 
with it."
