</PRE>IT'S TIME TO RE-EVALUATE OUR INVOLVEMENT 
<P>
Every day there are news reports about more deaths. Every night on TV 
there are photos of death and destruction. Why are we still there? 
<P>
We occupied this land, which we had to take by force, but it causes us 
nothing but trouble. Why are we still there? 
<P>
Many of our children go there and never come back. Why are we still 
there? Their government is unstable, and they have sporadic leadership. 
Why are we still there? 
<P>
Many of their people are uncivilized. Why are we still there? 
<P>
The place is subject to natural disasters, from which we are supposed to 
bail them out. Why are we still there? 
<P>
There are more than 1000 religious sects, which we do not understand. 
Why are we still there? 
<P>
Their folkways, foods, and fads are unfathomable to odinary Americans. 
Why are we still there? 
<P>
We can't even secure the borders. Why are we still there? 
<P>
They are billions of dollars in debt, and it will cost billions more to 
rebuild, which we cannot afford. Why are we still there? 
<P>
It is becoming clear... 
<P>
WE MUST PULL OUT OF CALIFORNIA 
<P>
