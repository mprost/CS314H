</PRE>I'm in the military, and the Army has just seen fit to move me to 
Washington, DC for a bit. 
<P>
I'm from a small town down in Florida, so this is a bit different for 
me. For example, I've never had to park in anything but a parking lot. 
This parking on the side of the street seems odd. 
<P>
Today, in the course of my job, I was running around town late at 
night. I ended up having to stop near the White House about midnight 
on a friday night. Now, I normally park in a government parking garage 
here, but it's closed. So I look around the streets to find a spot. I 
find one open, but see 4 signs next to it on a Telephone Pole. All of 
these signs have an arrow pointing both directions, which to me means 
the whole street. 
<P>
Sign 1- A bus with an X through it, says NO PARKING. Ok, I say to 
myself, No Parking for buses. 
<P>
Sign 2- NO PARKING 6.30 to 9.30AM, 4.30 to 7.30PM, Weekdays Ok, it's 
not those times. 
<P>
Sign 3- NO PARKING Except for Sundays. Erm.... ok.... what was Sign 2 
about then? 
<P>
Sign 4- NO PARKING ANYTIME. Erm... ok... what was Sign 1, 2, and 3 
about then? 
<P>
To me that's funny enough, but it does get better. 
<P>
Anyway, I'm already about an hour late on my rounds, so I park, hurry, 
do my job, hurry back. A Cop is parked behind me.... Great. Quick 
check... No cop in the car, no cop at my pickup, no ticket on the 
windshield, no boot on my wheel... Ok, I seem to be fine. I fill out 
some paperwork on my tailgate that I skipped in order to get back 
faster, and as I finish, I look up to see a cop walking towards me. 
<P>
Well, I am wearing a crisp, freshly pressed uniform and highly 
polished boots, I look fairly offical, and cops in my town, at least, 
cut you slack if you are trying to do the right thing. So I walk up to 
him, and ask "Sir, could you help me out for a second? With all these 
signs, I'm not entirely certain I'm parked in a legal space. I'd be 
more then happy to move if I'm not." 
<P>
The cop looks at my truck, then looks at the signs for a few moments. 
He finially looks back at me and says, "I don't know. We won't ticket 
you though, the most we will do is run your tag. But if it is Illegal, 
watch out for the metro police." 
<P>
I love this town. The cops can't even tell if what you do is illegal.
