</PRE>It was October and the Indians on a remote reservation asked their new 
Chief if the coming winter was going to be cold or mild.  Since he was a 
Chief in a modern society he had never been taught the old secrets.  When 
he looked at the sky he couldn't tell what the winter was going to be 
like.  Nevertheless, to be on the safe side he told his tribe that the 
winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village 
should collect firewood to be prepared. 
<P>
But being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea.  He went 
to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, "Is the 
coming winter going to be cold?"  "It looks like this winter is going to 
be quite cold" the meteorologist at the weather service responded.  So the 
Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood 
in order to be prepared. 
<P>
A week later he called the National Weather Service again.  "Does it still 
look like it is going to be a very cold winter?"  "Yes," the man at 
National Weather Service again replied, "it's going to be a very cold 
winter."  The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to 
collect every scrap of firewood they could find. 
<P>
Two weeks later the Chief called the National Weather Service again.  "Are 
you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?" 
"Absolutely," the man replied.  "It's looking more and more like it is 
going to be one of the coldest winters ever." 
<P>
"How can you be so sure?" the Chief asked. 
<P>
The weatherman replied, "The Indians are collecting firewood like crazy."
