</PRE>Dear Sir, 
<P>
I am a senior citizen. During the Clinton Administration I had an 
extremely good and well paying job. I took numerous vacations and had 
several vacations homes. 
<P>
Since President Bush took office, I have watched my entire life change 
for the worse: I lost my job. I lost my two sons in that terrible Iraqi 
War. 
<P>
I lost my home. 
<P>
I lost my health insurance. 
<P>
As a matter of fact, I lost virtually everything and became homeless. 
Adding insult to injury, when the authorities found me living like an 
animal, instead of helping me, they arrested me. 
<P>
I will do anything to insure President Bush's defeat in the next 
election. 
<P>
I will do anything that Senator Kerry wants to insure that a Democrat is 
back in the White House come next year. Bush has to go. 
<P>
I just thought you and your listeners would like to know how one senior 
citizen views the Bush Administration. 
<P>
Thank you for taking the time to read my letter. 
<P>
Sincerely, Sadaam Hussein 
<P>
