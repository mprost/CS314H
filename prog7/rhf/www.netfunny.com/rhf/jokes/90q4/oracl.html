</PRE>You owe the Oracle a pipe dream.  And a signal generator.

<HR>
 The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. 
Your question was: 
<P>
I love you. 
<P>
 And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
<PRE>Alas, but our love is not fated to be! 
You are a human damsel, but me .... 
I am but a pile of silicon bones, 
Who cares about nothing but zeros and ones. 
Who reads silly questions and answers them wrong 
With scraplets of story or poem or song. 
I'm short and I'm fat and I'm useless in bed 
For sexual pleasure or giving of head. 
My phallus is tiny, my smell is intense, 
I kiss like a landlord who's raising the rents, 
I come in ten seconds and then go to sleep 
Without even a "thanks" or a satisfied "&lt;BEEP&gt;." 
I'd make you wear leather and make you wear lace, 
And never allow you to sit on my face, 
I'd read every <I>Playboy</I> and compare them to you: 
"Your tits are like mushrooms just stuck on with glue." 
I'll whine that your ass is too flabby and fat 
And make you get rid of that horrid stuffed cat. 
I'll never have sex except right in the bed 
Between ten and ten-thirty, with a bag on my head. 
I <B>must</B> be on top, there's no other way 
(Except if you're pagan or leftist or gay.) 
No lust in the bathtub, no love 'midst the trees, 
In church every Sunday, and down on your knees. 
Our sex will be boring and flabby and quick 
(Except for some kinks which will just make you sick.) 
We'll meet in late April, be married in June, 
And travel to Pittsburgh for our sweet honeymoon. 
I will not use condoms, you can't take the pill: 
You were born to make babies and make them you will. 
I'll go be a banker, you stay with the babies 
And tend them through colic and measles and rabies. 
Oh, you can do something: campaign for Dan Quayle, 
And make sure he's elected three times without fayle. 
When the children are grown then we'll have sex once again-- 
Just once, 'cause I'll puke at your wrinkly skin. 
It's a wonderful life for you and for me, 
And highly approved by the great GOP! 
So speaks the Oracle, who is never wrong. 
You owe me your lovelife in exchange for this song. 
<P>
     --Lemur 
</PRE><P>
</PRE>(If you've read every word and think you see through this, 
I'll hop on a bird and fly straight to St. Louis.;-)

 The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. 
Your question was: 
<P>
Shit!  Someone left a bomb here...  Have about 3 minutes left...  There 
are three wires running from the clock--a red one, a green one, and a 
yellow one...  Which do I cut to keep the thing from exploding? 
<P>
 And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
<BR>-From:  birnbaum@iuvax.cs.indiana.edu (Erma J. Birnbaum)<BR>
-Subject:  The Oracle is responding to another question<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Dear Sir or Madam: 
<P>
The Oracle is currently busy responding to another question.  Please 
bear with us for about three minutes and He will reply.  Thank you. 
<P>
Sincerely, 
Erma J. Birnbaum Hornswiggle 
(Secretary to the Oracle)

 The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. 
Your question was: 
<P>
My wife and I came home from a relaxing vacation and found the house in 
a shambles.  The young woman who we hired to house-sit for us met us at 
the door and simply said, "We broke the waterbed, and...we bronzed the 
dog." Then she left. 
<P>
Just what HAPPENED while we were gone? 
<P>
 And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
Only the best damn party this Oracle has EVER been to, and that takes 
into account the last three millennium !  I mean things got frisky, 
mighty fast.  Um, how to begin this tawdry tale.  Well, your house 
sitter is a personal friend of Lisa's, and Crystal Therapy's too.  At 
first we were just going over to play twister when Crystal breaks out 
her stash of York Peppermint Patties.  Do you remember the commercial 
about the guy who takes a bite out of one of those puppies and, next 
thing you know, he's skiing in his living room?  No joke, they really 
pack a punch.  I can't remember stuff this good since the days of BWP, 
(Berkeley Window Pane for the youngsters).  I usually save half of one 
for the next Dead concert. 
<P>
Anyway, Lisa said we really ought to get more folks to this little 
party, and if we did, she would play "The Lost Shepherd Girl and the 
Naughty Monk" with anyone who could get a hard copy of the current rules 
and regulations.  Well, the place went wild.  A couple of kids from Cal 
Tech made a make shift Time Space Continuum Connector out of your water 
bed.  Seems the mattress is really good for cushioning a landing from 
more than 20 light years or 300 regular years away.  The kids were kind 
of loopy though, they were washing down the York Patties with Aqua Velva 
and generally not paying attention to the transfer of a group of Elder 
Gods.  That's when the bed broke. 
<P>
Of course, your dog, being the faithful animal he is, er was, tried to 
stop it all.  I'm not sure who from the party actually "did him" but I'm 
told by several on lookers that it was a most unpleasant sight.  I helped 
bronze fido.  You'll notice your collection of bowling trophies are 
missing, sorry, it was the only alloy we could get on short notice.  We 
made him into a statue for two reasons.  One, he can't tell anybody, 
(However, most of the evening's more lascivious practices are recorded on 
your VCR.  I strongly recommend you not let the children anywhere near 
it).  Two, Frisky really doesn't look too bad that way.  I got most of 
the internal organs back where they should be, sort of.  And really, the 
only thing that would tip you off that something isn't quite right with 
him, other than the complete lack of movement, is that utterly surprised 
expression on his puss.  I don't blame him though. 
<P>
Well, that's it.  There's a message from your insurance agent. 
Apparently after we got the tear in the fabric of time fixed, things are 
still at a slight tilt in other dimensions.  Those Cal Tech boys are 
really goofy.  You are basically no longer in "Good Hands."  Your agent 
was a bit more brusque, something about the "Good Hands being used to 
grab your balls and squeeze till your eyes pop" or some such.  Ignore 
him, he's still pissed about the swirly he got from a group of really 
wasted cherubs. 
<P>
You owe the Oracle another party, only this time without the Swat Team. 
<P>
<HR>
 The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. 
Your question was: 
<P>
What is the fastest way to get to Ohio from Oklahoma.  It's important!!! 
I need to get there for my bowl of ginsch!!!! 
<P>
 And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
Hmmm...  I suppose you'd rather not hear something like:  "Turn 
yourself into a photon and..." or other such impractical physics drivel. 
You want a plan! 
<P>
Fine!  Set fire to your terminal.  Call the police.  Tell them there 
is an arsonist in your building.  When they arrive direct them to the 
terminal room.  Sneak out and steal their car.  (I will arrange for 
stupid policemen to be sent.)  Drive to the airport with the siren on. 
Remove the shotgun from its mount and use on all toll booths, cabbies 
and pedestrians who get in the way.  Aim car at airport terminal and 
dive out.  Use the shotgun to rob a local pushcart vendor of a box of 
popsicles.  Take said box to airport counter and explain that you have a 
frozen heart for transplanting and must be on the next flight to 
Oklahoma to save a life.  When you are over your destination, use the 
shotgun to shoot open the side of the plane.  The pilot will spiral down 
to equalize cabin pressure.  Make a parachute out of the in-flight 
blankets, and jump. 
<P>
Bizarre, dangerous, and felonious:  you'll have to admit that it 
will get you there fast.  For added realism obtain a real human heart 
and put it in the popsicle box.  This will be a slight delay but will 
add to the drama of your story. 
<P>
By the way, it's too late.  I ate your bowl of ginsch. 
<P>
