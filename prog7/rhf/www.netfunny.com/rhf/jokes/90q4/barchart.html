Symptom  : Drinking fails to give satisfaction and taste ; shirt front is wet.

Fault    : Mouth not open when drinking or glass being applied to wrong part
           of face.

Solution : Buy another pint and practice in front of a mirror. Continue with
           as many pints as necessary until drinking technique is perfect.



Symptom  : Drinking fails to give satisfaction and taste ; Beer unusually pale
           and clear.

Fault    : Glass is empty.

Solution : Find someone who will buy you another pint.



Symptom  : Feet cold and wet.

Fault    : Glass being held at incorrect angle.

Solution : Turn glass so that open end is pointing at ceiling.
                              


Symptom  : Feet warm and wet.

Fault    : Loss of self-control.

Solution : Go and stand beside nearest dog - After a while complain to its
           owner about its lack of house training.
                        


Symptom  : Bar blurred.

Fault    : You are looking through the bottom of your empty glass.

Solution : Find someone who will buy you another pint.



Symptom  : Bar swaying.

Fault    : Air turbulence unusually high - maybe due to darts match in progress.

Solution : Insert broom handle down back of jacket.



Symptom  : Bar moving.

Fault    : You are being carried out.

           loudly that you are being hi-jacked.
           


Symptom  : The opposite wall is covered with ceiling tiles and has a
           fluorescent strip across it.

Fault    : You have fallen over backwards.

Solution : If glass is still full, and no one is standing on your drinking arm,
           stay put. If not, get someone to lift you up and lash you to the bar.

           see your bedroom walls or ceiling.

           yourself to a lie in.
               


Symptom  : Everything has gone dim.

Fault    : The pub is closing.

Solution : PANIC !!!!!
