<PRE>This is another joke I heard from a friend many years ago.  It is however
a translation from an Iranian joke.

                        ---------------------------------

A man goes to a restaurant and orders a chicken dish.  By the time the
food is ready and he is about to eat, the waiter comes back and says, "Sir,
I'm afraid there has been a mistake.  You see, that police officer who is
sitting at the next table is a regular customer of ours and he usually
orders the same dish.  The problem is, this is the last chicken in the
house.  I'm afraid I'll have to take this dish to him and arrange for
another dish for you!"

The guy gets really upset and refuses to give up his food.  The waiter walks
over to the other table and explains the situation to the officer.  A few
minutes later the officer walks over to the man's table and says,  "Listen
and listen good.  That is MY chicken you are about to eat and I'll warn you,
whatever you do to that chicken I'll do the same to you.  You pull out one
of its legs, I'll pull out one of yours.  You break one of its wings, I'll
break one of your arms!"

The man calmly looks at the chicken, then sticks his middle finger in the
bird's rectum, pulls it out and licks it.  He then gets up, drops his pants,
bends over and says, "Your turn!!"
