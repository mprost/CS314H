<H4>1. How to get rid of nuclear waste:</H4>
<P>
Sending nuclear waste into the sun is expensive, because of the amount of 
energy expended in getting it out of Earth's gravity well, which is most 
probably more energy than was obtained from the fuel in the first place. 
The best way to get rid of nuclear waste is to put it on the government 
surplus list.  People will bid on anything if they think they are getting 
a good deal.  And as for the damage it will cause, frankly do you really 
care what happens to people stupid enough to buy something that is clearly 
marked "Hazardous Nuclear Waste?" 
<P>
<H4>2. How to fund private space concerns:</H4>
<P>
This is a twofold problem: first the difficulty with Congress, and second 
the lack of funding.  Both these problems can be solved in one simple 
manner.  Make slavery legal again.  All the work on the Constitution has 
already been done; you merely need repeal the Emancipation Proclamation. 
Now, since congressmen are property of the government, put them up for 
auction.  I know I'd like to buy Gore or Helms and have them doing some 
heavy, dangerous construction work for me, and I am sure many others would 
as well.  Then, just send the money into space. 
<P>
<H4>3. How to solve net bandwidth problems:</H4>
<P>
Make network TV illegal.  Since everybody has cable anyway, this wouldn't 
have a severe impact in most areas.  Give half the bandwidth to the ham 
radio operators, then use the rest to establish a nationwide packet radio 
network for carrying the <tt>alt</tt> groups. 
<P>
<H4>4. How to fix the hole in the ozone layer:</H4>
<P>
Since open-air electric arcs generate ozone, simply replace all the 
outdoor sodium and mercury vapor lamps with carbon arcs.  This will have 
the side benefit of making our cities much brighter, as well as generating 
extra revenue for the power companies.  Enough ozone will be generated to 
surround most cities with a layer of ozone thick enough to block out UV 
radiation, preventing skin cancer except among those who go out at night 
under the bright arc lamps.  But since only muggers and rapists go out at 
night in big cities, it's okay.  This will reduce the crime problem as 
well. 
<P>
<H4>5. How to fix the drug problem:</H4>
<P>
Make drugs legal, then make them a state monopoly controlled by the DEA. 
Once the government starts running it, the huge profits will quickly 
disappear and it will no longer be lucrative for anyone.  The alternative 
of course is to let the Grateful Dead control it, and then it will be 
free for everybody and the quality will be much higher. 
<P>
<H4>6. How to fix the mideast crisis:</H4>
<P>
Have the Pope convert all the Jews and Arabs so that they are all Catholic. 
This can be done by applying mapcar to the convert operator across all Jews 
and Arabs.  If required, low flying aircraft spraying holy water may be 
employed.  Now once everybody is Catholic, they can all go home and have 
a nice cup of tea together.  The side effect is that this might cause the 
area to become like Northern Ireland if the operator is not properly applied. 
<P>
<H4>7. How to fix the crisis in education:</H4>
<P>
Since students in the past few years have been doing more poorly on 
standardized tests, the tests should be made easier so that students can 
do better.  Also, all standardized tests should be in English so that we 
can prove how much better our students are than the Japanese.  Colleges 
should be forced to have more programs like Business and Education which 
don't require the students to think very hard, so that we can have more 
college graduates.  A college degree is a right, not a privilege. 
<P>
<H4>8. How to fix the space shuttle:</H4>
<P>
Let Pete's Auto Repair take it over.  Pete can find the tiniest leaks in 
seconds, and fix anything with gaffer tape and sheet steel.  I swear that 
if anything is broken, Pete can fix it. 
<P>
<H4>9. On the issue of Lithuanian separatism:</H4>
<P>
Annex Lithuania as a part of the United States, and in exchange give 
Alabama to the Soviet Union.  This will make the Lithuanians happy to be 
in a democratic state, the Soviets happy because they will have an Alabama 
to go with their Georgia, and the United States happy because they will get 
a foreign market for hog jowls. 
<P>
<H4>10. Disarmament:</H4>
<P>
Since the Soviet Union and the United States are now at peace, they won't 
need any of those nasty nuclear weapons anymore.  The missiles can be 
used for valuable space payloads, and the warheads can be sold as surplus 
to third world nations like Northern Ireland, Libya, Israel, Egypt, and 
Yemen, who could actually get some use out of them.  Since you can only 
use a nuclear bomb once, it seems a shame to let it sit on the shelf and 
become obsolete.  Also this would generate extra revenue to help in the 
savings and loan bailout. 
<P>
I hope these answers to pressing political questions have been helpful.
