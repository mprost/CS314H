This is NASA Headline News for Tuesday, April 31..... 
<P>
The Congressional Budget Explorer Module (CBEM) is scheduled for 
installation in the orbiter Titanic's payload bay this afternoon. 
Technicians resolved an earlier problem with hydraulic line pressure 
when it was discovered that several fragments of lobbyist had become 
stuck in a flapper valve.  The 127-ton CBEM payload will mark the 
beginning of NASA's ambitious decade-long "Mission to Fort Knox." 
<P>
A Flight Eagerness Review is scheduled for tomorrow and Thursday.  The 
current target launch date is Friday, May 11.  If no further problems 
are uncovered in the FER, the launch will probably be pushed back a few 
days anyway just for the heck of it.  The CBEM launch window ends on 
Tuesday, May 21, when Venus rises in Aquarius and Neptune's influence is 
no longer balanced, violating critical Astral launch criteria. 
<P>

Meanwhile, the Velikovsky spacecraft is in good health on its journey to 
Venus.  It's now 122 million miles from Venus and about 28 feet from 
Earth.  Engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory report that failure 
to actually launch Velikovsky has had little impact on its ability to 
perform the primary pseudoscience missions.  Earlier problems with 
voltage fluctuations in the Wide Eyed/Credulous Subject Scanner are 
being monitored carefully.  "I'm pretending this is really exciting," 
says JPL team leader Geraldo R. Spencer. 
<P>
In other planetary mission news, technicians at the Deep Space Network 
installation in Canberra, Australia have identified the probable cause 
of signal weakness in the primary 90-meter antenna: the dish was 
apparently mounted upside-down.  A tentative schedule and budget 
estimate for correcting the mount is underway.  DSN Australian 
Coordinator Michael J. Dundee was quoted in the Australian weekly "P*** 
Off Mate" as saying that this mystifying problem had never been 
encountered before, but was probably due to reliance on American antenna 
design parameters.  "I'm still not convinced that anything's wrong, but 
we'll try it the other way and see."

Leak checks are underway on the Contractor Information Network (CIN) at 
Huntsville, Alabama.  Technicians at the Huntsville Program Survival 
Facility (PSF) expect to begin CIN closeouts by Thursday.  The system 
will then be purged for use. 
<P>
Aerobuck Weekly reports that in testimony last Thursday before the House 
Space and Storm Door Subcommittee, NASA Administrator Roald Sagdeev 
testified that a recent re-re-reshuffling and "options devaluation" 
would enable Space Station to proceed despite the latest round of budget 
cuts, but warned this was "absolutely the last cut that can be 
sustained."  Citing internal NASA studies, the publication listed 
several cost cutting measures under consideration, including a two year 
stretchout of the Ground Telerobotic Administrator (GTA) subsystem, and 
eliminating atmospheric pressure in the one remaining crew module, which 
would also be downsized from 23 feet to 16 feet.  The name of the station 
would be officially changed from "Freedom" to "Fred" to fit the new 
bulkhead dimensions.

The Soviets and Japanese jointly announced a contract with Hilton Hotels 
last week, to provide a 335-room passenger module for the international 
Sakharov Space Station currently under construction in Earth orbit. 
<P>
Malawi became the 78th nation in space Sunday, launching an 1820-pound 
satellite into orbit atop an Indonesian Merlata II booster.  This 
launcher now has a record of 69 successes in 71 launches. 
<P>
The last remaining Scout rocket was lost in a launch pad accident near 
Wallops Island Proving Ground last week, according to a NASA spokesman. 
Technicians apparently made an error in connecting a hydraulic feed line 
to the rocket as it awaited payload checkout, connecting it to the 
purge valve for a nearby Toxic Waste Holding Facility instead.  The 
first stage appears to have partially dissolved and melted itself to 
the concrete apron; EPA officials have ordered the site sealed pending 
checkout by an Emergency Response team.
