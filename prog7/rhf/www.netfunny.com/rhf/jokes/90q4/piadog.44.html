The Pianist
-----------

A pianist was hired to play background music for a movie.  When it was completed
he asked when and where he could see the picture.  The producer sheepishly
confessed that it was actually a porno film and it was due out in a month.
A month later, the musician went to a porno theater to see it.  With his collar
up and dark glasses on, he took a seat in the back row, next to a couple
who also seemed to be in disguise.

The movie was even raunchier than he had feared, featuring group sex, S/M and
even a dog.  After a while, the embarrassed pianist turned to the couple and
said, "I'm only her to listen to the music."

"Yeah?" replied the man. "Were only here to see our dog."
