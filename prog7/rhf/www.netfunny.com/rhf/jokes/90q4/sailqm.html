I heard this from a Welsh friend of mine, 
Peter Gardiner, who lives in London. 
<P>
It is the wedding day of Prince Charles and 
Lady Di.  Charles had been up late the night 
before boozing with his old Navy buddies, 
woke up late, threw on his clothes and rushed 
to the Royal Coach and set off.  In the coach, 
he noticed that he had forgotten his shoes, so 
he borrowed the ones his valet was wearing, 
but they were 2 sizes too small. 
<P>
Charles made it through the ceremony, then 
through the reception with his feet in agony the 
whole time, and finally with great 
relief, went upstairs with his new bride. 
<P>
Their departure was noticed by the Queen and 
Queen Mother who followed them up and 
listened at the the door.  First they heard, 
"Ohhh, ohhh, that feels so goood, it was sooo 
tight." 
<P>
"I told you she was," said the Queen to the 
Queen Mother. 
<P>
Then they heard, 
"Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ahhhh, that feels even better, 
and it was a lot tighter." 
<P>
"Tsk tsk tsk," said the Queen Mother, 
"Once a sailor, always a sailor." 
<P>
