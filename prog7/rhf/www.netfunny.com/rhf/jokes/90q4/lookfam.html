(If any of these are not original, please blame it on my Commerce 335 professor, 
Dr. Yair Wand.   Otherwise, all humour can be attributed to him as the source.) 
<P>
A physics professor was very strict about attendance, and despised 
tardiness.  Every student caught arriving to class late (especially those 
interrupting his lecture) was quickly reprimanded in front of the whole class. 
Students were quick to comment on the professor's genetics.  Well, one day a 
student entered through the front doors of the lecture hall, while the prof was 
writing notes on the chalkboard.  The professor caught the student out of the 
corner of his eye (this acute sense of peripheral vision, further supported the 
rumours of his evolution), and turned to face the student.  He demanded, "What 
do you think you're doing?"   Being a science student, one naturally thinks 
quickly, so the student snapped up and replied, "I came down from the back to 
get a better look at the board."  The prof smiled. 
<P>
Back in those days, it was required that in order for a student to receive 
credit for a particular course, a card (listing of his/her courses) had to be 
signed by the instructor/lecturer.  It was, at the time, policy that students 
attend their courses.  But depending on the size of the class, it was often 
quite possible to receive credit, even after not attending the class regularly. 
Not so, with this physics professor...if he didn't recognize you, you would 
have to repeat the course (&amp; attend!).  On one occasion, a student handed his 
card to be signed.  The professor looked at the name, then at the student, and 
said, "I've never seen you in my class," and handed back the card.  Now being a 
science student, he naturally thought quickly, and proceeded to the end of the 
line.  When he was at the front again, he handed his card to the prof. The 
prof looked at the name, then at the student, and said, "You look familiar. 
OK," and signed the card.
