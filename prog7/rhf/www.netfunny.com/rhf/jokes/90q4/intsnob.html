--&gt; NotMacMart Do you have this problem?
Do you refuse to watch anything on TV no matter how educational it is?
Do you find that you have trouble listening to other people talk about
   what they watched on TV last night?
Do you panic if the theater guide is missing?
Is your sofa torn and tattered from your frenzied attempts to find the
   loose change that fell out of your pocket while you were reading?
Do you know, at any given time, what is going on everywhere in the world
   without watching the evening news?
Do you ever miss interesting revival shows because you were using last
   week's theater listing or because the listing was in error?
Is your spouse threatening to leave you because you forgot to buy the
   new book they told you about over dinner last night?
Are you afraid of remote controls?
Have you been confused when you see a commercial and wondered why anyone
   would willingly watch that drivel?
If you answered "YES" to three or more of these questions, you may be
an INTELLECTUAL SNOB.  If intellectual snobberey is affecting your life,
then consult your local yellow pages for theater listings and go watch
an Arnie movie.
