HOW TO ADDRESS A NON SEXIST BUSINESS LETTER<BR>
By Andrew Berman<BR>
</center>
<P>
Let us look at the standard opening phrase of a standard business letter: 
<P>
<PRE>	Dear Sir, 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
Well, this is clearly sexist as it precludes the possibility that a 
woman is reading the letter.  We can try to fix this, however, by 
writing: 
<P>
<PRE>	Dear Sir/Madam, 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
This was suggested in a recent posting in a few of the gender-issue 
related news groups.  However, someone pointed out that by putting the 
masculine title before the feminine one, unacceptable dominance was 
demonstrated, making this non-PC.  So, I tried to fix it: 
<P>
<PRE>	Dear Madam/Sir, 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
Well, this is no good since we're showing dominance in the other 
direction.  Of course, since Men are Oppressors and Womyn are 
Oppressees, that may not be so bad.  But it's not <B>really</B> PC, is it? 
Ok, let's try again: 
<P>
<PRE>        Dear  Sir 
              Madam, 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
Well, that solves the problem of who goes first.  Of course, the Sir 
is on top now, which is completely unacceptable.  Missionary style 
het-sexist imagery abounds.  Very bad news, probably worse than the 
original.  Ok, what about: 
<P>
<PRE>        Dear Madam 
             Sir, 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
Well, I was once told that men laying on their back during sex was 
sexist as they were making women do all the work. Besides, you still 
have one on top of the other showing dominance. We may not sure who's 
doing what, but <B>somebody</B> is being oppressed here.  Next: 
<P>
<PRE>        Dear MadSiram, 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
Put the Sir inside the Madam, ok, neither is going first and neither 
is above the other one.  Ok?  NO!  This is terrible!  The Sir has 
inserted himself inside the Madam!  Practically splitting her in two 
with himself! How pornographic!! A man writing a letter addressed like 
this to a woman is obviously making an (unwanted) sexual advance.  If 
he were at Antioch college, he'd be suspended for a year and have to 
go through rehabilitation.  Catherine MacKinnon would have a fit! 
<P>
<PRE>        Dear SMadamir, 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
Now we put the Madam inside the Sir.  Oh, now the Sir has enveloped 
the Madam!  Horrors, she has lost her identity, her sense of self! 
This is imprisonment!  Ugh, how could I have even thought of this 
one?? I'm so ashamed! 
<P>
Well, there's only one answer left: 
<P>
<PRE>        To Whom it May Concern 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
There.  Simple, no reference to sex or sexuality, no problems.  Not 
very friendly, but then again unwanted intimacy is a sin.  And getting 
rid of friendliness is a small price to pay to make sure that 
absolutely no-one is ever, <B>ever</B> offended. 
<P>
