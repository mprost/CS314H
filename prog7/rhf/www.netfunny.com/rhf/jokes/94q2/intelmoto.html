This is a true story of mind-bending gullibility and proof that only 
the really stupid get promotion. The names have been changed to protect 
the innocent. 
<P>
The .sig is removed too! 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
It is on a major networking project for the Avionics industry that we 
find an engineer working on a device driver for an intelligent LAN card 
which has a Motorola 68040 on it. The project itself has been 
an isolated blackspot of chaos and confusion on the otherwise clean 
and white tapestry of this <B>large</B> Companies unparalleled achievements 
in the industry. You know the sort of thing, huge slippages in delivery, 
closures of huge projects. Fiscal control which ensures that you have 
to sign for a paper clip whilst Contract Engineers sit about for months 
unable to do anything as they dont have PC's. 
<P>
So one day, to relieve the tension of yet another Team Brief about 
Management Reorganisations or something similar, the engineer sticks an 
``Intel Inside'' sticker to the large expanse of ceramic which is the 
68040. As Intel have adapoted a rather garish and some would say 
tasteless image with these red lettering-on-white backgroud stickers, 
Motorola have moved to the other end of the scale. To Motorola, less is 
more - and the logo is in small letters tucked up on one side. 
<P>
Nothing happended for a week or so until enevitably it was noticed by 
a passer by. On the project there are many such individuals. They are 
engaged in furious activity, the gathering of metrics, the production 
of timescales which show huge slippage but when incorporated into Management 
reports seem to show on-time delivery. Anyway, as the individual staggered 
past he noticed the ``Intel Inside'' sticker on the 68040. Feeling a little 
humerous, the Engineer replied thus : 
<P>
"Yes, marvellous is'nt it. It is part of the Second Sourcing agreement 
between Intel and Motorola. As a result of an Anti-trust Federal 
Investigation they have been forced to Second Source eachothers 
products. As the supplier of the LAN card is involved in the forefront 
of technology they are using the new product" 
<P>
The passer by seemed happy with the explanation and moved on. This 
was repeated many times during the week. Somebody would remark on the 
sticker and the same story would be repeated slightly embellished at 
each recital and becoming more convincing each time. 
<P>
Enter the new Systems Engineer. Sporting a bow-tie and a hugely polished 
bald-head he too notices the ``Intel Inside'' sticker. And as with 
the others he gets the same speech which was now replite with 
Federal ruling numbers and document references etc. So successful 
was the recital that the Engineer put a twist at the end : 
<P>
"The snag is that this card with ``Intel Inside'' is doing 
some pretty wierd things. The other card with out ``Intel Inside'' 
is fine. I'm guessing that they have fooled with the microcode as 
it runs faster." 
<P>
Now the Systems Engineer was doing his best to slide himself up the 
greasy pole of the Management Ladder and found that this information could 
be put to good political ends. Due to the level of chaos, Politics was the 
only way people could actually show achievement. Back he came for more 
information, received a long explanation of microcoding and the details 
of Federal Law and other stuff which sailed clean over his shiny bald 
head. Oblivious to the smell of bullshit in the air he went off happy. 
<P>
To fully appreciate the scale of the disaster looming infront of him, 
you must appreciate that this has now gone on for about 8 weeks and that 
by now most of the building already knew that it was a joke. The fact 
that nobody informed the bald-headded one serves as a tribute to the 
number of people he had annoyed in his relentless quest for power. 
<P>
The story comes to an end as, armed with the damning information to 
be used against the LAN team he marches into the Systems Directors office 
and snitches on the LAN team. He reveals all, that the LAN team are 
using 68040's Second Sourced from Intel and that we could'nt allow it 
as there were probably microcode faults and in any case the Law suits 
could blow up again. How the LAN group's Team Leader could have been 
allowed to continue with this is anyones guess. The Systems Director 
looked at him hard and invited him to get out of his f****** office. 
As our hero backed out of the office, he was unaware that the Systems 
Director had been chuckling with the Engineer a few weeks agao about the 
sticker on the 68040. The fact that he may have slightly incorrect 
now penetrated the bald-one's crainium and he went to verify the facts. 
During a prolonged verbal beating he realised that the story was 
the joke of the building and that he, very deservedly was now the 
butt of it. 
<P>
The final part is the most scary. As a close observer commented, 
"It has gone past being the Sublime to the Ridiculous, it is now 
the Slime to the Ridiculed" 
<P>
He did get his reward however. In the true spirit of the Organisation 
which has contributed so much to the farcial running of the project 
he got Promoted to head up one of the product lines!!! The new joke 
is watching the perfectly able and competent Team Leaders (etc) 
finding that they are working for somebody who does'nt know his 
Motorola from his Intel. We now have people looking for something 
really silly to beleive in so that they will get promoted too. Something 
even more ludicrous that the project delivering. 
<P>
Did you hear of the joint venture IBM and DEC are doing in Super PC's......
