         NEW YORK (Reuter) - It was a kinder, gentler Dan Quayle who
came to Manhattan Monday to sign copies of his new book,
''Standing Firm.''

[deletia..]

         Many of the Quaylephiles, wearing ``Bush/Quayle'' buttons or
carrying signs, made comments about the possibility of his
running for president in 1996, which Quayle himself has hinted
at lately. ``Good luck in a couple of years,'' or ``looking
forward to your inauguration,'' they said.
         One man, however, carried a toy ``Mr Potato Head'' -- a
reference to the time Quayle told a student who had spelled
''potato'' correctly that he should add an ``e'' to the end.
         The man was hustled away by store employees before he could
get the toy out of the bag. He did get his signed book, though.
         Apparently, spelling problems continue to dog Quayle. He
spent a fair amount of time with a woman and a small girl about
six years old, posing with the child and signing some blank note
paper for her.
         The girl's mother could clearly be heard telling Quayle:
''S-a-m-a-n-t-h-a.''
