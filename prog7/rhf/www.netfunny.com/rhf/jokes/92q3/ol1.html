<PRE>Here is a set of samplings from the one-liner file.  When processing
submissions, if I see a short joke that is good but doesn't quite merit
a posting of its own, I put it in the one-liner file.  I haven't
posted the results for quite some time, so some of these are pretty old.
I have split the file up into 10 chunks of around 300 lines each.  Some
newsreaders go crazy and try to "undigestify" this -- beware.

Subject: Check please...

A new corollary to Murphy's law (experimentally verified this past weekend
at the Olive Garden restaurant in Spokane, Washington):

Five milliseconds after beginning to chew a mouthful of food,
the waiter will arrive and ask if it tastes OK.  He will be unable to
interpret hasty nods of the head, thumbs-up gestures, or words from your
spouse, and will wait, staring at you like a stunned ox, until you have
chewed, swallowed, and allayed his fears yourself: "yes."

We tipped him anyway.
