<PRE>At about 2am, shortly after I'd moved to a new apartment, the phoone rang.  My
roommate picked it up, and, half asleep, this is the conversation he thought
he had:

 Voice: Hi, this is 99 KCPX.
 Roommate: Okay.
 V: We want to play a song, if that's okay.
 R: What?
 V: &lt;name of song&gt;.  Is that okay?
 R: Yeah.
 V: Okay, bye.

My roommate and I decided that either (a) it was a prank call by some friends
or strangers, or (b) it was a prank call by the radio station.

The next afternoon, the phone rang.  I answered.

 Voice: Can I make a request?
 Me: What?
 Voice: Is this KCPX?
 Me: No.
 Voice: Sorry.

I then looked at the letter eqivalents of our new phone number: 375-KCPX.  The
call at 2am had been someone trying to make a request, and my roommate had
been too asleep to understand.

Our phone number provided great amusement over the next two years:

 Me: You're caller number 99!  You won!
 V: I did?  What did I win?
 M: An all-expenses paid trip to Provo, Utah!
 V: But I'm already in Provo.
 M: Then it won't cost us a penny.

 V: Hi, can I make a request?
 M: Sure, go ahead.
 V: "I Want Your Sex" by George Michael.
 M: Oh, I'm sorry, but we can't play that on the radio.
 V: Oh.
    &lt;hangs up, calls back a minute later&gt;
    Can you play "Funky Cold Medina" by Ton Loc?
 M: I'm sorry, I can't play that on the radio, either.
 V: Oh.
    &lt;hangs up, calls back a minute later&gt;
    Can you play "Coming to America" by Niel Diamond?
 M: No, sorry.
 V: But hey, that's a good song.
 M: Yes, it is.  But I can't play it on the radio.  This isn't a
        radio station!
