<PRE>Here is a set of samplings from the one-liner file.  When processing
submissions, if I see a short joke that is good but doesn't quite merit
a posting of its own, I put it in the one-liner file.  I haven't
posted the results for quite some time, so some of these are pretty old.
I have split the file up into 10 chunks of around 300 lines each.  Some
newsreaders go crazy and try to "undigestify" this -- beware.

Subject: Faulty utterance

I believe this joke to be original, although I heard it from
a friend a few days ago, and it's so obvious that somebody
must have used it years ago:

What says: "Pieces of nine, pieces of nine!"

A parroty error!

Subject: joke - vasectomy problems


I just heard this at lunch today from a co-worker cracking up the table.

In his words:
   
	"After my vasectomy, my testicles disappeared.  The doctor
	couldn't find them, so he replaced them with small onions.
	Now I only have two problems, first whenever I see a gorgeous
	woman my eyes water, and second whenever I see a delicious 
	hamburger I get a massive hard-on."

Subject: Funny buns

I took Brad Templeton out to lunch one day, and afterwards, we stopped
by a bakery to bring eleven doughnuts back to the office.  The baker
offered a free sticky bun to pad our order to an even dozen, and Brad
refused the bun.  After we left, I asked why.  He said that he never
selects buns, especially pad buns.

(To the obvious tune ...)
 
      Moonshine ... on my shoulders ... makes me slip'ry ...
      Moonshine ... in my eyes ... would make me cry ...
      Moonshine ... mixed with water ... still tastes lovely ...
      Moonshine ... almost always ... makes me high ...

      I'd brew a brew ... sure to make you smile ...

Original.

One of the more interesting takeovers in the recent past was that
of GE taking over the makers of BVD underwears.  For
diversification purposes, of course.  Their new slogan, you ask?
"We bring good things to life, in your BVD."

Seen on a local BBS:

 
   As the expected time of birth drew near, the mother-to-be asked her
obstetrician, "Will my husband be permitted to stay with me during my
delivery?"
 
   "Certainly," the doctor answered. "The father should always be present
at the moment of birth."
 
   "That wouldn't be a good idea," the woman remarked. "He and my husband
don't get along."
