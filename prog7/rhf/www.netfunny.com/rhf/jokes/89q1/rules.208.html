I found this in the salon where I get my hair cut.  The owner says she 
feels these rules are correctly stated. 
<P>
<H4>THE RULES*</H4>
<P>
For those of you who don't already know, these are the rules that are in 
effect in every relationship. 
<P>
<!--  list-->
<OL><LI>The female always makes the rules. 
<LI>These rules are subject to change at any time without prior 
notification. 
<LI><I>No male can possibly know all the rules.</I> 
<LI>If the female suspects that the male knows all the rules, she must 
immediately change some or all of the rules. 
<LI><I>The female is never wrong.</I> 
<LI>If the female is wrong it is because of a vagrant misunderstanding 
which was a direct result of something the male said or did wrong. 
<LI>If rule number six applies, the male must immediately apologize for 
causing the misunderstanding. 
<LI>The female can change her mind at any given point in time. 
<LI>The male must never change his mind without express written consent of 
the female. 
<LI>The female has every right to be angry or upset at any time. 
<LI>The male must remain calm at all times, unless the female wants him to 
be angry or upset. 
<LI>The female must under no circumstances let the male know whether she 
wants him to be calm, angry or upset. 
<LI>Any attempt to document these rules could result in bodily harm. 
<LI>The female always gets the last word! 
</OL>
<P>
*These rules are subject to change as the female sees fit.
