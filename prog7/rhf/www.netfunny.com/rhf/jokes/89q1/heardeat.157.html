Three conventioneers had finally managed to tire their wives to go back to 
the hotel and finally located a house of negotiable affection.  The madam 
was crestfallen. 
<P>
"Sorry fellows, all the girls are busy...  No one left but me." 
<P>
"Gee, we spent most of the evening getting rid of our wives and we're leaving 
tomorrow, isn't there anything you can do?" 
<P>
"Well there's always me, I give specials..." 
<P>
The first guy decided he'd go for it and when he came back downstairs he had 
a grin ear to ear. 
<P>
"How was it?  How much was it?" 
<P>
"It was great!  I got the $25 special.  She has this can of Readi-Whip and 
she sprays it all around and then licks it off, great!" 
<P>
The second fellow doesn't hesitate, bolts up the stairs and is back after a 
while, grinning like the first. 
<P>
"How was it?  How much was it?" 
<P>
"It was super!  I got the $50 special.  Same as Jack, the Readi-Whip, but 
she had some chopped walnuts that she sprinkled on it.  Nibbled off the 
walnuts and licked off the Readi-Whip, faantaaastic!" 
<P>
The third could not be constrained, he raced up the stairs and came back 
shortly thereafter, chin between his knees. 
<P>
"Gosh!  What happened?  What went wrong?" 
<P>
"Well, I got the $75 special, kinda like what you guys got but she starts 
with a pineapple ring.  Then there's the Readi-Whip, the chopped walnuts, 
but she's got some chocolate sprinkles and a cherry she puts on top.  Damn! 
it looked so good I ate it myself..." 
<P>
