Heard from a friend... 
<P>
Three stupid guys just died and are at the pearly gates of heaven. 
St. Peter tells them that they can enter the gates if they can answer 
one simple question. 
<P>
St. Peter asks the first man, "WHAT IS EASTER?" 
<P>
The man replies, "Oh, that's easy, it's the holiday in November when everybody 
gets together, eats turkey, and is thankful..." 
<P>
"WRONG," replies St. Peter, and proceeds to ask the second man the same 
question, "WHAT IS EASTER?" 
<P>
The second man replies, "No, Easter is the holiday in December when we put up 
a nice tree, exchange presents, and celebrate the birth of Jesus." 
<P>
St. Peter looks at the second man, shakes his head in disgust, looks at the 
third man and asks, "WHAT IS EASTER?" 
<P>
The third man smiles and looks St. Pete in the eye. 
<P>
"I know what Easter is. Easter is the Christian holiday that coincides with 
the Jewish celebration of Passover.  Jesus and his disciples were eating at 
the last supper and He was later deceived and turned over to the Romans by one 
of his disciples.  The Romans took Him to be crucified and was stabbed in the 
side, made Him wear a crown of thorns, and He was hung on a cross.  He was 
buried in a nearby cave which was sealed off by a large boulder.  Every year the 
boulder is moved aside so that Jesus can come out, and if He sees his shadow 
there will be six more weeks of winter." 
<P>
