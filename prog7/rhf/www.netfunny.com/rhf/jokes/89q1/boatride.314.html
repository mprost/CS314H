The following memos were reprinted in SPY magazine a few months back. 
I've edited them down to just the pertinent parts.

<PRE><P>
RUDOLF GIULIANI: PROSECUTOR AS PARTY POOPER 
The following five memos reprinted below were all circulated in Rudolf 
Giuliani's Manhattan office last summer. 
<P>
Memo #1:  Written by a member of the U.S. Attorney's official memo 
	  memo writing staff. 
<P>
				M E M O R A N D U M 
<P>
	Date: June 14, 1988 
	From: The Boat Ride Committee 
	Re: The Summer Boat Ride 
	To: All Staff and Summer Students 
<P>
	The Summer Boat Ride will be on Monday, July 18, from 7-11, 
	PM.  Boarding begins at 6:30 PM at Pier 62 at 23rd Street. 
<P>
	etc..... 
<P>
Memo #2:  Written by a member of the U.S. Attorney's official memo 
	  writing staff. 
<P>
				M E M O R A N D U M 
<P>
	Date: July 13, 1988 
	From: The Boat Ride Committee 
	Re: 1988 Summer Boat Ride 
	To: All Staff and Summer Students 
<P>
	We are once again oversubscribed for the summer boat ride by 
	more than 100 people.  We therefore need your help in reducing 
	the number of attendees.  If you signed up for the boat ride but 
	now know that you cannot attend, <I>or</I> if you no longer plan to 
	bring a guest, <I>or</I> if, given our oversubscription problem, you 
	generously decide not to bring a guest, please inform Mildred 
	Miles as soon as possible.  Your cooperation is most appreciated 
	and will help us avoid more drastic means to reduce attendance. 
	At the time of boarding, we will have to check attendance, which 
	is limited to those persons who submitted RSVP forms by no later 
	than July 11. 
<P>
	etc... 
<P>
Memo #3:  Written by a member of the U.S. Attorney's official memo 
	  writing staff. 
<P>
				M E M O R A N D U M 
<P>
	Date: July 15, 1988 
	From: The Boat Ride Committee 
	Re: 1988 Summer Boat Ride 
	To: All Staff and Summer Students 
<P>
	Because we have not been able to solve our oversubscription 
	problem for the summer boat ride, we unfortunately will have 
	to cut back on the number of guests at the event.  We regret 
	that we will only be able to accomodate spauses or "significant 
	others" of staff.  Please do not bring as guests anyone but a 
	spouse or "significant other."  In addition, using other people's 
	RSVP's as a means of getting friends on board will not be 
	permitted. 
<P>
	Only those people who submitted RSVP forms by July 11 will 
	be allowed to board the boat.  We will be checking attendance 
	that night, so please bring office ID's with you to the boat ride. 
	To avoid embarrassment for yourself or others, please abide by 
	these request.  We thank you for your cooperation in solving this 
	difficult overcrowding problem. 
<P>
Memo #4:  Written by an anonymous parodist in Giuliani's office and 
	  circulated as if written by the U.S. Attorney's official 
	  memo writing staff. 
<P>
				M E M O R A N D U M 
<P>
	Date: July 15, 1988 
	From: The Boat Ride Committee 
	Re: 1988 Summer Boat Ride 
	To: All Staff and Summer Students. 
<P>
	Some confusion has apparently arisen concerning the precise 
	meaning of the term "significant other," as expressed in today's 
	previous memorandum about authorized attendees at the boat ride. 
	By "significant other,"  we mean truly significant others,  
	i.e., persons with whom you have slept within the past month. 
	Lest further confusion arise as a result of this classification, 
	let us go further into defining our terms.  By "slept with," we 
	mean sexual relations, including but not limited to sexual 
	intercourse and oral sex. 
<P>
	Only those others who satisfy this definition of "significant" 
	will be allowed to board the boat.  To avoid embarrassment for 
	yourself and others, you and your guest should be prepared to 
	respond truthfully to questions concerning the nature and 
	degree of your intimacy.  We thank you for your cooperation in 
	our efforts to solve the problem of overcrowding at this 
	year's boat ride. 
<P>
Memo #5:  Written by U.S. Attorney Rudolf Giuliani himself. 
<P>
			M E M O R A N D U M 
<P>
	Date: July 15, 1988 
	From: Rudolf Giuliani 
	To: The entire office 
<P>
	Apparently the office was circulated today with a memo concerning 
	Monday's boat ride that may have been intended as humor or as a 
	practical joke.  It was neither humorous nor a joke.  In fact, it 
	was distasteful and upsetting to many. 
<P>
	Everyone in the office can appreciate someone with a sense of 
	humor.  I hope that the person who sent this will understand that 
	this message was out of bounds and offensive.  It ought not to have 
	been done and under no circumstances is it or anything like it to 
	be repeated.  Fair warning. 
<P>
