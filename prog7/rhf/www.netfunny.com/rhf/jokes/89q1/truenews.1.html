I am afraid that I have to blame Alice Dunsmuir for this one.  She 
was the occasional secretary and booking agent for Fat Moose.  One 
passenger was very worried about getting on an airplane that had a 
bomb on board.  The argument that this was less than a one in a million 
chance really was not working.  So Alice suggested that the passanger 
carry a bomb on board, for the chance of getting on an airplane with 
two bombs on board was so small as to be almost never.

MAN FLIES MATTRESS AS HOME EXPLODES 
<P>
- Crystal Lake, Illinois. 
<P>
A flying mattress carries a 79 year old man to safety as his suburban home 
was leveled by a natural gas explosion.  The incident occurred Thursday 
morning as James Steurer was sitting on his bed putting on his shoes. 
Moments later he was still sitting on his mattress - outside on the 
driveway, blown out of side wall of his home by the force of the explosion, 
which also threw a side wall of the home against a next-door garage, and 
gave off a blast of heat that melted the siding on a neighboring house.

delusion that he is dead:

Medical Student:  Now, what seems to be the problem here? 
<P>
Patient:  No problem, I'm just dead. 
<P>
M. S.:  No, no, you can't be dead.  Look, you're standing here talking to me. 
You couldn't do that if you were dead, could you? (no response from P) 
<P>
Now listen, (pinches him) that hurts, right?  (no response from P) 
If you were dead, you wouldn't feel that, would you?  (no response)

(aggravated, pinches harder) Don't try to tell me that doesn't hurt... 
(still no response) 
<P>
(noticing that her pinching has drawn blood) Now look at that!  You

The Bank of England decided to replace the one pound banknote with a coin. 
In an apparent attempt to make the new coin look like the traditional one 
pound gold coin (referred to as a "sovereign"), it was to be thick, and was 
to be made out of a nickel-copper alloy, which had a yellowish color.  When 
the new "round pound" was issued, it quickly garnered the nickname "Maggie 
Thatcher" because it was "round, thick, brassy, and acted like a sovereign."

"The most unusual French loo I know is at the Argentiere Hut, in the 
Alps near Chamonix. It is a small cabin at the edge of a ledge, and 
the pans open directly onto a drop of several hundred metres onto a 
glacier. I noticed the climbers who went into it would pick up a few 
pebbles or shards of granite, which struck me as a particularly severe 
alternative to toilet paper, but it turned out they were for a 
different purpose. The toilet was effectively pressurised by the wind 
blasted up from below, so that when the job was done the uninitiated 
would step through the door accompanied by a cloud of used tissues 
and exclamations of horror." 
<P>
[This sounds like the worst kind of air pollution imaginable. 
Presumably, the rocks were used as weights for ensuring that the used 
paper made it to the bottom. One expects that the glacier below would 
NOT be a popular spot... the next one's worse, though.]

<P>
"The Ambassador had the most basic of loos, a hole in the floor. It 
became infamous among overland adventure tour operators before the 
Soviet invasion as more than one troubled guest settled down to the 
urgent task only to have their attention drawn to a sound from above. 
In their tentative incursion into highrise accommodation, the builders 
had put each bathroom above one another!"

When the F.B.I. puts people undercover, it wants them to behave like

The undercover agents, of course, participated in this (illegal) activity. 
The U.S. Attorney made his first set of indictments on the Friday 
before the Super Bowl.  At this point, the agents' cover is blown. 
As expected, all the agents participated in the Super Bowl pool. 
What wasn't expected is that one of the agents would have placed the 
winning bet.  The pool contained $4000.  Furthermore, decorum requires 
that the winner personally collect his money.  Needless to say, the pot 
remains uncollected.

Dear Sir/Madam 
<P>
The declining moral situation around us is a portent threatening mankind, 
and is causing much consternation to every thinking soul, especially to the 
intellectuals among us. Responsible citizens throughout the world often 
wonder whether they should remain dumb witnesses to this moral landslide. 
<P>
As a scholar and humanitarian you must have assessed this situation and your 
keen eyes must have traveled far and deep to view the moral decline of 
today and the situation resulting from it. You must have also thought about 
an answer. 
<P>
Would you be so very kind as to express your views on the moral decline and 
its causes and also to please put down on a piece of paper the ways you 
propose to deal with the situation? 
<P>
I am addressing this letter to nearly ten thousand of scholars and thinkers 
and it is my wish to collect and preserve their views and, if necessary, to 
give these views the form of a book and arrange for the distribution of such 
a book. 
<P>
The two very important questions are: 
<P>
1. What is your opinion about the moral bankruptcy which is so 
rampant today, what are in your views its causes and how do you 
propose to remedy them? 
<P>
2. Would you bracket together the dangers to the peace and moral 
lapses and how do you suggest to rehabilitate the peace and order? 
<P>
Kindly write your lofty ideas in a minimum number of words, say 500, on your 
letter-head or on plain paper and send it to me with your address. This will 
be a valuable piece of writing which shall be preserved in the Hamdard 
Library. I am sure you will grant acceptance to my request and give me the 
honour to be the trustee of your note.

This appeared in today's (2/17) Seattle Post-Intelligencer: 
<P>
It was a flush with a rush. 
<P>
Toilets and urinals in the King County Courthouse 
exploded yesterday after a worker in Metro's downtown bus 
tunnel mistakenly connected an air compressor to the building's 
water line. 
<P>
As soon as hapless individuals flushed the pressurized 
privies, the plumbing started popping in restrooms throughout 
the 72-year-old building, said building services manager Bill 
Kemp. 
<P>
"They started blowing at about 11:30 (a.m.) and it took 
us awhile to figure it out," he recounted."We knew it had to be 
air in the system but the Water Department said that was impossible." 
<P>
It wasn't.  The source of the problem was finally tracked 
to the tunnel under Third Avenue, and the errant air compressor 
was shut down. 
<P>
But not before employees on every floor in the 10-story 
courthouse had stories to tell about gushing geysers in the john. 
<P>
"We think we've lost about 20 to 25 toilets," said Kemp. 
"The porcelain is actually cracked." 
<P>
Kemp said no one has admitted being hurt by the unusual 
blast, although several people were badly drenched.  Or very 
surprised. 
<P>
Explained Kemp, "The urinals acted more like bidets." 
We had other reports that people were not necessarily on the toilet 
but close." 
<P>
"This has not exactly been a good day for Metro," he noted.

Reproduced with permission, and with apologies to Lovecraft.

Mark, Cathy and Harry share an apartment with a family of several thousand

peeved at finding the furniture rearranged without notice, Mark decided to 
commit genocide. He bought a can of surface spray.

A distorted leer on his face, he methodically covered the skirting 
boards, cupboards, cracks, nooks and lairs of his enemy with the fast-acting 
contact poison. He was merciless, rooting out forgotten nests and spraying 
crucial strategic points with the fine but deadly mist. When the can 
finally ran out, he knew that morning would see a newer, cleaner, better 
world for humans to live in. Smug and confident in his powers, he settled 
down for a well-earned rest.

Night fell. A clear, silent moonlit night. Quiet. Perhaps, too quiet. For 
the first time in memory, no scampering of greasy exoskeleton, no clacking 
of mandibles, no buzz of shadowy wings to disturb the great white mammals, 
dormant and safe in their nocturnal hibernation. All around the hunting 
fields, tantalising with the promise of cheese sandwiches, a heavy pall 
hung. Not an inch, not a smidgen, not a scad of floor space could be 
found that was not covered with the insidious but certain death. Not even 
a place to stand, except ...

Harry woke with it. He thought it was the rain. But the night 
was clear. The moon shone through his bedroom window. Then he felt it. 
Then he started to scream.

Mark and Cathy ran to Harry's room, armed with large blunt objects. The 
door was locked. Inside, they could hear whimpering, a tiny voice 
crying "No no no no ...," and the sound of rain. Mark hammered on the 
door. Cathy went to ring the police. The door thudded once, and then

I was paging through a recently acquired 727 manual and came across this little 
gem of wisdom.  (GPWS is the ground proximity warning system.  It tells the 
crew when the ground is getting too close for what they're doing.) 
<P>
"Note: the GPWS will not provide a warning if an airplane is flying 
directly towards a vertical cliff."
