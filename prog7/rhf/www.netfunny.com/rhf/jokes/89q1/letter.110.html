<P>
TO MY DEAR WIFE: 
<P>
During the past year, I have tried to make love to you 365 times, I 
have succeeded 36 times, which is an average of once every 10 days.  The 
following is a list of why I did not succeed more often : 
<P>
<BR>1.  WE WILL WAKE THE CHILDREN...17 times<BR>
2.  IT'S TOO LATE...15 times<BR>
3.  I'M TOO TIRED...5 times<BR>
4.  IT'S TOO EARLY...52 times<BR>
5.  IT'S TOO HOT...15 times<BR>
6.  PRETENDING TO BE ASLEEP...49 times<BR>
7.  THE NEIGHBOURS WILL HEAR...9 times<BR>
8.  BACKACHE...2 times<BR>
9.  HEADACHE...26 times<BR>
10. SUNBURNT...10 times<BR>
11. YOUR MOTHER WILL HEAR US...36 times<BR>
12. NOT IN THE MOOD...21 times<BR>
13. YOU WILL WAKE THE BABY...17 times<BR>
14. WATCHING THE LATE SHOW...7 times<BR>
15. TOO SORE...9 times<BR>
16. NEW HAIRDO...6 times<BR>
17. THE WRONG TIME OF THE MONTH...14 times<BR>
18. YOU HAD TO GO TO THE TOILET...19 times<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Of the 36 times I did succeed, the activity was not entirely 
satisfactory, 
because 6 times you just laid there, 8 times you reminded me there was a 
crack in the ceiling, 4 times you told me to hurry up and get it over with, 
7 times I had to wake you up to tell you that I had finished and once I was 
afraid I had hurt you because I felt you move. 
<P>
TO MY DEAR HUSBAND : 
<P>
I think you have got things a little confused. Here are the reasons 
you did not get more than you did : 
<P>
<BR>1.  CAME HOME DRUNK AND TRIED TO FUCK THE CAT...7 times<BR>
2.  DID NOT COME HOME AT ALL...29 times<BR>
3.  DID NOT COME...14 times<BR>
4.  CAME TOO SOON...26 times<BR>
5.  WENT SOFT BEFORE YOU GOT IN...18 times<BR>
6.  TOES IN A CRAMP...9 times<BR>
7.  WORKING TOO LATE...51 times<BR>
8.  YOU HAD A RASH - PROBABLY FROM A TOILET SEAT...21 times<BR>
9.  SOMEBODY KICKED YOU IN THE BALLS, IN A FIGHT...4 times<BR>
10. CAUGHT IT IN YOUR ZIPPER ... 8 times<BR>
11. GOT A COLD, YOUR NOSE KEPT RUNNING...14 times<BR>
12. BREWERS DROP AND ALCO-LIMP...95 times<BR>
13. YOUR TEA WAS TOO HOT - BURNT TONGUE...8 times<BR>
14. YOU HAD A SPLINTER IN YOUR FINGER...4 times<BR>
15. LOST IT AFTER THINKING ABOUT IT ALL DAY...13 times<BR>
16. CAME IN YOUR PJs WHILE READING DIRTY BOOK...8 times<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Of the times we did get together, the reason I lay still was because 
you missed, and were fucking the sheets. It wasn't talking about the crack in 
the ceiling, what I said was, "would you prefer me on my back, or kneeling." 
<P>
The times you felt me move was because you farted, and I was trying to breathe. 
However, six months ago, I phoned the A.A. for help, and their rep. has been 
calling on me most afternoons. 
<P>
