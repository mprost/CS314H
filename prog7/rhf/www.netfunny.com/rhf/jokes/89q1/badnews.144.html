Announcing Badnews,(TM) a realistic approach to Usenet. 
<P>
<H5>Why Badnews?</H5>
<P>
The news software currently in use freely mixes policy with mechanism and 
actually creates obstacles for its user community.  In practice, this inhibits 
no one and merely results in frustration which, as has been clinically proved, 
leads to aggression.  The time has come to give users what they really want. 
<P>
Badnews fixes the following bugs in previous news software: 
<P>
1) Due to a bug, previous news read/post programs limited the 'cancel' command 
to the users own postings.  Badnews fixes this problem. 
<P>
2) Previous signatures were limited to 4 lines.  Badnews supports arbitrarily 
large signatures.  If your signature is too small, badnews will pad it with 
such cute sayings as "flames &gt;/dev/null" and the like. 
<P>
3) Previous software insisted that followup additions be longer than included 
text.  In this interim release, badnews fixes this restriction by 
automatically generating extra lines of cute sayings like "inews fodder." 
<P>
4) To avoid wasting bandwidth caused by articles failing to reach their 
intended target, badnews will refuse to post articles not crossposted to 
at least 4 newsgroups. 
<P>
5) Due to a design error, previous news software actually discouraged thoughtful 
postings and selected for ego-maniacs and one-true-wayists by trying to 
intimidate the poster asking if they "really wanted to do this."  Badnews 
will be more supportive and say "Thank you for sharing." 
<P>
6) Current software encourages a bandwidth wasting redundancy by requiring a 
'Subject:' line when the actual subject (if any) can always be inferred 
from the article itself.  Badnews eliminates this redundancy by 
automatically generating a contentless or irrelevant 'Subject:' such as 
"Help needed," "Posting," or "This line intentionally left blank." 
<P>
<H5>New commands available</H5>
<P>
1) The 'Sue' command automatically initiates a lawsuit against the author of 
the currently read message. 
<P>
2) The 'Expand' command automatically decrypts many common abbreviations which 
may appear in the currently read message, such as: IMHO, PC, SO, BTW, MOTAS, 
BMW, MES 
<P>
3) The 'Suicide' command automatically deposits the users name in other 
users' kill files.  In this interim release, this command is limited to 
adding your name to Ted Kaldis's kill file. 
<P>
4) The 'Notify' command contacts powerful people associated with the currently 
read message.  Current options include:  notify employer, notify sysadmin, 
and notify the press. 
<P>
5) The 'Sexchange' command automatically switches the genders in the message 
currently being read.  The interim release limits this function to two 
genders. 
<P>
<H5>New posting aids</H5>
<P>
Many postings are actually the same or similar to messages sent before.  In 
order to make such duplication easier, Badnews provides automatic posting on 
common topics selected from a menu.  Menus currently available will cover 
<P>
1) Hoaxes/urban legends 
<P>
2) Requests for money 
<P>
3) Jokes about strings 
<P>
4) Commonly asked questions (e.g. How do I get my current directory to print 
out in my prompt?) 
<P>
5) A SERIOUS DILEMMA FOR THE NET 
<P>
6) Appropriate flames to respond to the user using 1-5 above 
<P>
7) Appropriate counter flame to respond to user using 6 above 
<P>
Future enhancements will include: 
<P>
1) Kill with prejudice which will notify via mail (with appropriate nasty 
epithets) the author of any article being killed. 
<P>
2) Kill by gender, ethnic group, political slant. 
<P>
3) Auto-forge to fake the header of real or non-existent persons. 
<P>
4) The 'Pull' command to pull another user's net account. 
<P>
5) Kill with extreme prejudice, to actually terminate the life of a user. 
<P>
6) Starwars, to build a shield to protect oneself from 1-5 above. 
<P>
