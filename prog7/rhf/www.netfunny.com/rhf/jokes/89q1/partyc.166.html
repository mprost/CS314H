JUST IMAGINE BEING A RESPECTED AND BELOVED FATHERLY LEADER UNDER WHOSE

Over the past few years, Party Builders Associates has aided countless 
individuals and groups to form vanguard parties intelligently tailored 
to their own needs. These people are now leading creative, happy lives 
fighting one another. What we've done for others, we can do for you. 
A few minutes filling out the following questionnaire may be the best 
investment you'll ever make. Your answers will enable Party Builders 
Associates, preserving strict confidentiality, to work out a party 
program that is JUST RIGHT for you and your friends. 
And now, here's the questionnaire. We advise using a pencil, since these 
are by no means easy questions, and your party will not be able to alter 
the positions taken here without seriously damaging your credibility 
among the workers.
