(  I think I got this from Usenet years ago.  --r$  ) 
<P>
<H4>Rinaldo's Laws</H4>
<P>
As I will be leaving the Washington area in early May, I thought it 
appropriate to share the wisdom that I have accumulated thus far.  These 
truths have come not as a vision but by observation over time.  Accordingly, 
I have synthesized the following laws. 
<P>
<H5>Choreography is its own reward</H5>
<P>
Some things are done only for the sake of form.  Don't fight it by 
looking for substance in everything.  Do it long enough and you'll 
find enjoyment in an elephant dance. 
<P>
<H5>He who does the work shapes it</H5>
<P>
As applied to computers, he who writes the code rules (the Coding 
rule).  In meetings, he who writes the minutes determines the 
outcome. 
<P>
<H5>The less the knowledge, the more jealously it is preserved</H5>
<P>
Societies with only a few precious facts make their people memorize 
them and pledge to faithfully abide by them.  In contrast, highly 
developed disciplines quit worrying about losing knowledge (unless the 
computer crashes and there is no backup). 
<P>
<H5>Excellence increases demands</H5>
<P>
Critics gather to spot tinier flaws as work nears perfection. 
Promptness invites impatience.  In correspondence, the faster you 
answer a letter, the faster your correspondent will answer giving you 
something with a shorter deadline.  This reaches a fever pitch with 
electronic mail. 
<P>
<H5>Skills diminish professionalism</H5>
<P>
Engineers who admit to drafting skills are vulnerable to assignment of 
drafting work, just to help out.  Similarly, female professionals 
should hide any clerical skills lest they be asked to pinch hit for 
one of the secretaries in the event of illness. 
<P>
<H5>What separates the competent from the incompetent is the ability to cover up mistakes</H5>
<P>
Many successful sales demonstrations have been made with defective 
products in the hands of competent persons who avoid demonstrating the 
features which don't work.  Beautiful Xerox copies can be made from 
originals riddled with correction fluid.  Recovery from some grievous 
errors can be attained by simply announcing, "No problem.  We'll just 
put it back in the word processor!"  The computer software profession 
seems to be the exception; who else is so blatant as to have a term 
such as "debugging" to let the world know that they need extra time 
funded by the customer to correct their own errors. 
<P>
<H5>Silence is not acquiescence</H5>
<P>
Contrary to what you may have heard, silence of those present is not 
necessarily consent, even the reluctant variety.  They simply may sit 
in stunned silence and figure ways of sabotaging the plan after they 
regain their composure. 
<P>
<H5>Quick-reaction and slow-reaction facilities rotate</H5>
<P>
Once people discover that there is a quick-reaction facility (QRF), 
they will try to get all their work done there, bogging it down in 
work and leaving the slow-reaction facility (SRF) nothing to do, thus 
becoming the faster of the two. 
<P>
<H5>Complexity attracts brilliance</H5>
<P>
The KISS (keep it simple, stupid) principle is no fun and certainly 
not a professional approach.  If you want brilliant people to do work 
for you make it complex and demanding.  The true professional will 
spend 20 hours at the computer writing a one-time-use program that 
will replace 10 hours of clerical work.  Anyway, 20 hours at 
professional rates pays more than 10 hours at clerical rates.  Also, 
it's more intellectually rewarding.  The greatest achievement is to 
use one's finest professional talents to accomplish something that 
didn't need to be done. 
<P>
<H5>Bad guys are replaced</H5>
<P>
Did you ever rejoice over the departure of someone that you couldn't 
get along with only to find that a replica has shown up?  When you are 
trying to make a U-turn and you have someone tailgating you, have you 
pulled off on a side street, then into an alley only to find that two 
other cars are right behind you? 
<P>
