<STRONG>[Ed: a JEDR (Jedder) is a Joke Ethnic/Denomination/Race.  It is substituted for 
any specific identifiable group to avoid offence.]</STRONG> 
<P>
Your basic virgin female was all set to get married to a virile JEDR, 
when her mother took her aside for a little pre-nuptial advice. 
<P>
"Dear, I know you love this man," the mother began.  "And we've tried 
to welcome him into our family.  But there is something you must know. 
These JEDRs like to make love in a disgusting way, so if he ever asks 
you to turn over before making love, DON'T do it.  It's degrading and 
painful, and it will ruin your marriage." 
<P>
So the wedding is fine.  The happy couple enjoys their first month 
of marital bliss, when one night, the JEDR says to his wife, "Honey, 
let's try making love a little differently tonight.  Why don't you roll 
over?" 
<P>
The woman loses it.  "You brute," she sobs.  "My mother warned me about 
you JEDRs, I can't believe you would do this to me." 
<P>
"But honey," the startled JEDR replies.  "I just thought you might 
want to have children." 
<P>
