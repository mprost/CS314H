[ This once appeared in one of the throwaway EE-type magazines, 
like EDN or EE Times.  The accompanying drawing shows a lone figure 
facing three gunmen down a long, deserted western street. ] 
<P>
Dust was the color of the sky. 
<P>
Dust was the color of the town. 
<P>
The young sheriff moved toward the railway platform, 
pausing only to wipe his moist palms on his holsters. 
<P>
He watched the Union Pacific engine hurtle around the bend 
and screech to a clanging, hissing stop.  Silently, the 
Dalton boys swung from the train onto the station platform. 
Suddenly the sheriff found himself staring down the barrels 
of three shotguns.  The street behind him was empty but 
for the dust. 
<P>
There was no turning for help. 
<P>
As his hands crept slowly toward his gun belt he knew he had to 
say it now or forever hold his peace.  A crooked smile played about 
the corners of his mouth, as he drawled, "Boys, I want you to hear 
me and hear me good.  Just remember, that Xerox is a registered 
trademark of Xerox Corporation and, as its brand name, should be 
used only to identify its products and services."
