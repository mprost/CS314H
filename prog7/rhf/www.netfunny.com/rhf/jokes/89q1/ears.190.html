Heard at a party: 
<P>
There was this man who was in a horrible accident, and was injured. 
But the only permanent damage he suffered was the amputation of both 
of his ears.  As a result of this "unusual" handicap, he was very 
self-conscious about his having no ears. 
<P>
Because of the accident, he received a large sum of money from the 
insurance company.  It was always his dream to own his own business, 
so he decided with all this money he had, he now had the means to own 
a business.  So he went out and purchased a small, but expanding 
computer firm.  But he realized that he had no business knowledge at 
all, so he decided that he would have to hire someone to run the business. 
<P>
He picked out three top candidates, and interviewed each of them. 
<P>
The first interview went really well.  He really liked this guy. His last 
question for this first candidate was "Do you notice anything unusual 
about me?"  The guy said, "Now that you mention it, you have no ears." 
The man got really upset and threw the guy out. 
<P>
The second interview went even better than the first.  This candidate was 
much better than the first.  Again, to conclude the interview, 
the man asked the same question again, "Do you notice anything unusual 
about me?"  The guy also noticed, "Yes, you have no ears."  The man 
was really upset again, and threw this second candidate out. 
<P>
Then he had the third interview.  The third candidate was even better than 
the second, the best out of all of them.  Almost certain that he 
wanted to hire this guy, the man once again asked, "Do you notice 
anything unusual about me?"  The guy replied "Yeah, you are wearing 
contact lenses."  Surprised, the man then asked, "Wow!  That's quite 
perceptive of you!  How could you tell?"  The guy answered "Easy.  You 
can't wear eye glasses.  You don't have any f*cking ears!" 
<P>
