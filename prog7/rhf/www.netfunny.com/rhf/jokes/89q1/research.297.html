<PRE>THEY WRITE                                      |THEY MEAN 
<P>
It has long been known that...                  |I haven't bothered to look up 
                                                |the original reference 
<P>
...of great theoretical and practical           |...interesting to me 
importance                                               
<P>
While it has not been possible to               |The experiments didn't work 
provide definite answers to these               |out, but I figured I could at  
questions.               			|least get a publication out  
        					|of it. 
<P>
The W-Pb system was chosen as         	        |The fellow in the next lab had 
especially suitable to show the                 |some already made up 
predicted behavior... 
<P>
High purity...                                  |Composition unknown except 
Very high purity...                             |for the exaggerated claims of 
Extremely high purity...                        |the supplier 
Super-purity... 
Spectroscopically pure... 
<P>
A fiducial reference line...                    |A scratch 
<P>
Three of the samples were                       |The results of the others  
chosen for detailed study...        		|didn't make sense and were  
        			                |ignored.. 
<P>
...handled with extreme care during             |...not dropped on the floor 
the experiments 
<P>
Typical results are shown...                    |The best results are shown... 
<P>
Although some detail has been lost              |It is impossible to tell from  
in reproduction, it is clear from the           |the  micrograph 
original micrograph that... 
<P>
Presumably at longer times...                   |I didn't take the time to find  
        					|out 
<P>
The agreement with the predicted                |fair 
curve is excellent 
<P>
good                                            |poor 
<P>
satisfactory                                    |doubtful 
<P>
fair                                            |imaginary 
<P>
...as good as could be expected                 |non-existent 
<P>
These results will be reported at               |I might get around to this 
a later date                                    |sometime 
<P>
The most reliable values are those              |He was a student of mine 
of Jones 
<P>
It is suggested that... 
It is believed that...                           |I think... 
It may be that... 
<P>
It is generally believed that....                |I have such a good objection  
        					 |to this answer that I shall  
        					 |now raise it. 
<P>
It is clear that much additional                 |I don't understand it 
work will be required before a 
complete understanding... 
<P>
Unfortunately, a quantitative theory            |Neither does anybody else 
to account for these effects has not 
been formulated 
<P>
Correct within an order of magnitude            |Wrong 
<P>
It is to be hoped that this work                |This paper isn't very good but 
will stimulate further work in the field        |neither are any of the others 
        					|on this miserable subject 
<P>
Thanks are due to Joe Glotz for                 |Glotz did the work and Doe 
assistance with the experiments and             |explained what it meant. 
to John Doe for valuable discussions.
