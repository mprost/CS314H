 From: &lt;name omitted&gt; 
 Subject: Re: On with the Show this is it... 
  
 In article &lt;identifiers omitted&gt; &lt;another name omitted&gt;  writes: 
 &gt; Could someone please send me the complete set of words for the song 
 &gt; that opens/closes the bugs bunny cartoons.  You know...the song starts 
 &gt; off something like this: 
 &gt;  
 &gt;       Oh Mashay, Purple Lights 
 &gt;       This is it; the life we like 
 &gt;       We've been rehearsing and working our parts 
 &gt;       We know every part by heart... 
  
 My goodness!  "Oh Mashay, Purple Lights"?   
  
 &lt;insert badly suppressed laughter here&gt; 
  
 I'm sorry, I'll behave now. 
 .... 
<P>
 From: &lt;someone else's name omitted&gt; 
 This is TOTALLY from long-term memory, probably not totally right, but 
 it's the best I can come up with for now... 
  
   Overture, curb the lights, 
   This is it, the night of nights, 
 ... 
 Are there other verses? 
<P>
Actually, &lt;omitted&gt; wasn't too far off.  I have a newly-released book on 
the Warner Bros. animation studios (the real inside story) called "From 
Cels to Cells--Bugs, Thugs, and Drugs at Warner Brothers" And it lists 
the words to this song.  If you sing it, you'll see how well it fits the 
tune.  I'll add explanations as appropriate: 
<P>
Oh Mache' Curb the Lights! 
This a zit? Deny the knights! 
No Morey--hearse 
Ignore nursing apart. 
Ween?  Oh, Avery part!  Pie art! 
<P>
Oh, Mature!  Curb the Lights! 
This a zit? We lit the hides! 
And owe what hides we lit. 
Unwitting Joe, This a zit? 
<P>
NOTES: 
<P>
OH MACHE'--(as in paper-mache--for various reasons, this was WB 
slang for heroin) 
<P>
CURB THE LIGHTS!--(The assistant animators and 'tweeners used to laugh 
at how badly their stoned-out bosses reacted to the bright lights used 
in production.) 
<P>
THIS A ZIT? --(Cartoon characters never have complexion problems 
before their close up scenes.  This was the animation studio's dig at 
live actors and the difficulties of working with them.) 
<P>
DENY THE KNIGHTS!--(Again, a dig at the live stuff.  WB had been 
cranking out those chivalry epics one after another.) 
<P>
NO MOREY HEARSE--(Morey Amsterdam wanted to do some voices for them, 
and the animators wanted him.  Blanc pulled some strings with Jack 
Warner, though, and Morey was `dead') 
<P>
IGNORE NURSING APART--(Chuck Jones's very shapely young wife was 
nursing her new baby around the studios, and he'd asked everyone-- 
especially the lascivious Tex Avery--not to stare at her.) 
<P>
WEEN?  OH, AVERY PART!  PIE ART!--(Jones frequently threatened to 
decorate Avery's face with a pie if he (TA) didn't stop staring at his 
(CJ) wife's breasts. 
<P>
OH, MATURE!--(Victor Mature was always hanging around the studios, 
trying to get them to model a 'toon after him.  The couldn't get rid of 
him.) 
<P>
CURB THE LIGHTS!--(ibid) 
<P>
THIS A ZIT?--(ibid) 
<P>
WE LIT THE HIDES!--(Referring to the evening of the drunken rampage in 
which they burned all the old WB Tarzan costumes.) 
<P>
AND OWE WHAT HIDES WE LIT.--(They, of course, had to reimburse the 
studio for this arsonous running amok.) 
<P>
UNWITTING JOE--(Their secret nickname for a local teamster boss who 
had a lot of leverage over all their union staff) 
<P>
THIS A ZIT?--(ibid) 
<P>
 Are there other verses? 
<P>
Yes, but you don't want to hear 'em.  They are <B>reeeaaalllly obscure! 
<P>
Hope this helps.
