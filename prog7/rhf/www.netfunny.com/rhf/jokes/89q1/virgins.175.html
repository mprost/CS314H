<P>
</PRE>Good evening. 
<P>
Recently, whilst engaged in--well, let's be perfectly frank, 
this is an open forum after all--intercourse with my wife, i 
discovered an amazing new position, in which the female partner 
occupies what might be called the "dominant" or "top" position, rather 
than the more proper bottom position.  We were curious as to whether 
anyone else has tried this revolutionary concept.  We're rather afraid 
to admit it in public, since I think it falls outside of the bounds of 
general decency and propriety...but, as the common people say, life is 
too short not to "live it up" a little, eh what?

</PRE>ive never told anyone else about this before, but i thought 
you all might like to hear about it.  it all started one night when i 
was studying for a physics test all alone in a classroom and this girl 
walked in and sat down and started studying.  i couldn't help but 
notice her most prominent features.  i had a hard time concentrating 
on my textbook.  all i could think about was introducing myself to 
her.  i imagined myself walking up to her--actually walking up to a 
real woman--and GREETING her.  i reached down and started idly playing 
with my calculator as i fantasized.  i thought of asking her out for 
frozen yogurt.  i thought of "accidentally" brushing against her round, 
soft hands.  i couldn't stand it.  i had to do it.  but then she got 
up and left.

</PRE>Dear Prudes and Virgins Digest, 
<P>
This is ever so awkward, but i was wondering what your readers would 
consider to be...ummm....attractive... in the way of nightwear.  Do the 
readers prefer cotton, flannel or rayon full length nightgowns?  Is there 
a tendency towards prints or solids?  Fitted or roomy? 
<P>
This is truly a burning question on my mind, as just the other evening as 
my husband Percy and I were each reading various excerpts from Better Homes 
and Gardens Do-It Yourself Guide to Home Remodeling and Percy commented 
that perhaps to lend excitement to our marriage in much the same way our 
new storm windows add pizazz to our living room I should invest in some new 
nightwear. I hope your readers can assist me in my shopping endeavors.

</PRE>Dear P and V Digest 
<P>
Just the other day I engaged in the most unbelievable 
fantasy :^). I needed to study for my Chaucer exam and 
ducked into what I'd hoped to be an unused classroom. 
Well, this was the furthest from the truth.  There was a 
young man in this room, but I was feeling a bit, shall we 
say devil-may-care, and i brought my books in and sat in a desk 
about two or three rows over from the young man. He was 
quite attractive, what with his neatly manicured hands and 
crisply shaved sideburns, and his shirt was neatly pressed 
as well.  I very much wanted him to approach me, and to 
offer me a refreshment of some sort.  We could discuss 
literature or this season's choice of music here with the 
University Symphony or perhaps the social happening next week 
at the Christian Center.  My thoughts ranged even further into 
the future, about how, if we were married, we could have wild, 
frenzied family picnics. 
<P>
His shoes were neatly buffed, and he was reading what appeared 
to be some scientific manual or text, and he must have 
been an intelligent and well-mannered young man, and he would 
been an excellent conversationalist, and, well, just thinking 
of him <B>talking</B> to me got me so....ruffled.... i just had to 
go get a lemonade from the Cafeteria and I left quickly 
even before I could review my most recent notes.

PS--Please assign an alias and a mailbox to me; many people 
in my school read News and I wouldn't want them to get the wrong 
impression of me.
