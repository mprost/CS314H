A novice was trying to fix a broken Lisp machine by turning the 
power off and on.  Knight, seeing what the student was doing 
spoke sternly:  "You can not fix a machine by just power-cycling 
it with no understanding of what is going wrong."  Knight turned 
the machine off and on.  The machine worked.

One day a student came to Moon and said, "I understand how to 
make a better garbage collector.  We must keep a reference count 
of the pointers to each cons."  Moon patiently told the student 
the following story:

In the days when Sussman was a novice Minsky once came to him as 
he sat hacking at the PDP-6.  "What are you doing?" asked 
Minsky.  "I am training a randomly wired neural net to play 
Tic-Tac-Toe."  "Why is the net wired randomly?" asked Minsky. 
"I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play." 
Minsky shut his eyes.  "Why do you close your eyes?" Sussman 
asked his teacher.  "So the room will be empty."  At that 
moment, Sussman was enlightened.

A student, in hopes of understanding the Lambda-nature, came to 
Greenblatt.  As they spoke a Multics system hacker walked by. 
"Is it true," asked the student, "that PL-1 has many of the same 
data types as Lisp?"  Almost before the student had finished his 
question, Greenblatt shouted, "FOO!" and hit the student with a 
stick.

A disciple of another sect once came to Drescher as he was 
eating his morning meal.  "I would like to give you this 
personality test," said the outsider, "because I want you to be 
happy."  Drescher took the paper that was offered him and put it 
into the toaster:  "I wish the toaster to be happy, too."

A man from AI walked across the mountains to SAIL to see the 
Master, Knuth.  When he arrived, the Master was nowhere to be 
found.  "Where is the wise one named Knuth?" he asked a passing 
student.  "Ah," said the student, "you have not heard.  He has 
gone on a pilgrimage across the mountains to the temple of AI to 
seek out new disciples."  Hearing this, the man was Enlightened.

A famous Lisp Hacker noticed an Undergraduate sitting in front 
of a Xerox 1108, trying to edit a complex Klone network via a 
browser.  Wanting to help, the Hacker clicked one of the nodes 
in the network with the mouse, and asked, "what do you see?" 
Very earnestly, the Undergraduate replied "I see a cursor."  The 
Hacker then quickly pressed the boot toggle at the back of the 
keyboard, while simultaneously hitting the Undergraduate over 
the head with a thick Interlisp Manual.  The Undergraduate was 
then Enlightened.
