<PRE>        A Steamer developed trouble in one of its pressure valves in its
 engine room that caused an explosion.  The ship was sinking fast, but the
 crew acted swiftly to get the passengers off onto life rafts.  Finally,
 the crew started piling into the rafts.  When it got down to the last 3-man
 lifeboat, only the Captain and three of his crew were left behind.
        The Captain turned to his crew:  "I don't believe these stories
 about the captain going down with his ship, and since there is only enough
 room in this lifeboat for three of us, I'm going to aske each of you one
 question.  Whoever answers correctly can get into the lifeboat."
        The Captain addressed the first sailor: "What famous 'Unsinkable'
 ship went down after striking an iceburg?"
        The first sailor immediately responded, "The Titanic, sir!" and
 climbed into the lifeboat.
        Then the Captain asked the second sailor:  "How many people went
 down with the Titanic?"
        The second sailor immediately responded, "One thousand, three
 hundred and fourty-seven, Sir!" and climbed into the lifeboat.
        Turning to the last sailor, the Captain asked:
           "And what were their names?"
