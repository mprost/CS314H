<PRE>Here are more snippets from the one liner file.  While preparing RHF,
I collect short jokes that aren't quite worthy of an individual posting
in the one liner file.  Every so often I put digests of these out to
the group.  (Beware that some readers, such as NN, will mistakenly
present all these items in the digest as individual articles. 
Undigestification is a stupid kludge, but you have to live with it.)

These short items may contain swearing, mature themes and stereotypes.

Two friends went to a striptease show.  Despite the air-conditioning,
one noticed that his companion was sweating profusely.
Concerned, he asked his friend, "Is it too hot for you in here"?
"No", replied the other, "It's not the teat but the tumidity".

Subject: Intel/AMD lawsuit
From: apple.com!well!alcmist@decwrl.UUCP (Frederick Wamsley)

&lt;original, as far as I know&gt;

Intel CEO Andy Groves responded to AMD's allegations against Intel by 
calling AMD "the Milli Vanilli of the chip business".

This suggests interesting possibilities.  Is Intel the Frank Sinatra 
of the chip business?  Is IBM the Barry Manilow of systems?  Apple
is clearly the Madonna of personal computers.  Data General would be
the Guns 'n Roses of minis.

And I won't even tell you who Microsoft is!

Subject: Imitation is the sincerest form of...

My fiancee on occasion pretends to be a dumb blonde, which she does
uncannily well, despite being brilliant and raven-haired.  She said the
following to me yesterday (tongue in cheek):

"Sherri wanted to, y'know, play this game on her Macintosh, and so she,
y'know, asked me for help 'cause she was having problems getting it to load
-- but I don't know why, 'cause I don't know anything about the Mac, since
all the computers at work are PC's, right?  But you know what?  I played
with it for a minute and it's just like that Windows program!  Except I
don't think they did as good a job with it as they do on the PC."

Heard from an office mate.

Claims it is a true story.

There is a bar out west that has an open bar in the front and instead of the
back room filled with pool tables, they have poker tables.  At this bar, they
sell t-shirts to generate extra funds that says:

	"Liquor up front, Poker in the rear"

The real reason for the collapse of the coup in the Soviet Union
has now become clear.  The Soviets have managed to gain what
Americans have been trying to get for more than 200 years:
