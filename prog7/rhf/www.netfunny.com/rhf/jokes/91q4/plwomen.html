There are so many programming languages available that it can be very 
difficult to get to know them all well enough to pick the right one for you. 
On the other hand most men know what kind of woman appeals to them. So here 
is a handy guide for many of the popular programming languages that describes 
what kind of women they would be if programming languages were women. 
<P>
<B>Assembler</B>--A female track star who holds all the world speed records.  She 
is hard and bumpy, and so is not that pleasant to embrace.  She can cook up 
any meal, but needs a complete and detailed recipe.  She is not beautiful or 
educated, and speaks in monosyllables like "MOV, JUMP, INC."  She has a 
fierce and violent temper that make her the choice of last resort. 
<P>
<B>FORTRAN</B>--Your grey-haired grandmother.  People make fun of her just because 
she is old, but if you take the time to listen, you can learn from her 
experiences and her mistakes.  During her lifetime she has acquired many 
useful skills in sewing and cooking (subroutine libraries).  That no younger 
women can match, so be thankful she is still around.  She has a notoriously 
bad temper and when angered will start yelling and throwing dishes.  It was 
mostly her bad temper that made grandad search for another wife. 
<P>
<B>COBOL</B>--A plump secretary.  She talks far too much, and most of what she says 
can be ignored.  She works hard and long hours, but can't handle really 
complicated jobs.  She has a short and unpredictable temper, so no one really 
likes working with her.  She can cook meals for a huge family, but only knows 
bland recipes. 
<P>
<B>BASIC</B>--The horny divorcee that lives next door.  Her specialty is seducing 
young boys and it seems she is always readily available for them.  She 
teaches them many amazing things, or at least they seem amazing because it is 
their first experience.  She is not that young herself, but because she was 
their first lover the boys always remember her fondly.  Her cooking and 
sewing skills are mediocre, but largely irrelevant, it's the frolicking that 
the boys like.  The opinion that adults have of Mrs.  BASIC is varied. 
Shockingly, some fathers actually introduce their own sons to this immoral 
woman!  But generally the more righteous adults try to correct the badly 
influenced young men by introducing them to well behaved women like Miss 
Pascal. 
<P>
<B>PL/I</B>--A bordello madam.  She wears silk dresses, diamonds, furs and red high 
heels.  At one time she seemed very attractive, but now she just seems 
overweight and tacky.  Tastes change. 
<P>
<B>C</B>--A lady executive.  An avid jogger, very healthy, and not too talkative. 
Is an good cook if you like spicy food.  Unless you double check everything 
you say (through LINT) you can unleash her fierce temper.  Her daughter C++ 
is still quite young and prone to tantrums, but it seems that she will grow 
up into a fine young woman of milder temper and more sophisticated character. 
<P>
<B>ALGOL 60</B>--Your father's wartime sweetheart, petite, well proportioned, and 
sweet tempered.  She disappeared mysteriously during the war, but your dad 
still talks about her shapely form and their steamy romance.  He never 
actually tasted much of her cooking. 
<P>
<B>Pascal</B>--A grammar school teacher, and Algol 60's younger sister.  Like her 
sister she is petite and attractive, but very bossy.  She is a good cook but 
only if the recipe requires no more than one pot (module). 
<P>
<B>Modula II</B>--A high-school teacher and Pascal's daughter.  Very much like her 
mother, but she has learned to cook with more than one pot. 
<P>
<B>ALGOL 68</B>--Algol 60's niece.  A high-society woman, well educated and terse. 
Few men can fully understand her when she talks, and her former lovers still 
discuss her mysterious personality.  She is very choosy about her romances 
and won't take just any man as her lover.  She hasn't been seen lately, and 
rumor has it that she died in a fall from an ivory tower. 
<P>
<B>LISP</B>--She is an aging beatnik, who lives in a rural commune with her hippie 
cousins SMALLTALK and FORTH.  Many men (mostly college students) who have 
visited the farmhouse enthusiastically praise the natural food, and 
perpetual love-ins that take place there.  Others criticize the long cooking 
times, and the abnormal sexual postures (prefix and postfix). Although these 
women seldom have full-time jobs, when they do work, their employers praise 
them for their imagination, but usually not for their efficiency. 
<P>
<B>APL</B>--A fancy caterer specializing in Greek food.  She can cook delicious 
meals for rows and rows of tables with dozens of people at each table.  She 
doesn't talk much, as that would just slow her work down.  Few people can 
understand her recipes, since they are in a foreign language, and are all 
recorded in mirror writing. 
<P>
<B>LOGO</B>--A grade-school art teacher.  She is just the kind of teacher that you 
wish you had when you were young.  She is shapely and patient, but not an 
interesting conversationalist.  She can cook up delicious kiddie snacks, but 
not full-course meals. 
<P>
<B>LUCID &amp; PROLOG</B>--These clever teenagers show a new kind of cooking skill. 
They can cook-up fine meals without the use of recipes, working solely from a 
description of the desired meal (declarative cooking).  Many men are 
fascinated by this and have already proposed marriage.  Others complain that 
the girls work very slowly, and that often the description of the meal must 
be just as long as a recipe would be.  It is hard to predict what these girls 
will be like when they are fully mature. 
<P>
<B>Ada</B>--A WAC colonel built like an amazon.  She is always setting strict 
rules, but if you follow them, she keeps her temper.  She is quite talkative, 
always spouting army regulations, and using obscure military talk.  You gotta 
love her though, because the army says so.
