COURSE TITLE:   DATA STRUCTURES
COURSE NUMBER:  5150
CLASS DESIGNATION:      COMPUTER SCIENCE, CS420
PREREQUISITES:  CS150
UNITS: 5.0
CLASS HOURS: M W F 7P-10P
LAB HOURS:  MTWTF 8A-11P

This class assumes basic knowledge of the constructs presented in CS150
("Letting C Confuse You") and how to use an editor (adb is presented as
the programmer's editor of choice).  The course will cover all forms
of Data Structures including:

	Arrays with indeces into the interrupt vector table
	Structures with self-referencing elements (pointers optional).
	Unions with self-referencing elements (pointers optional).

Also presented are various lists, linked, unlinked and random.  Among
those covered are:

    LIFO (Last In, First Out)  Also called a "stack".
    FIFO (First In, First Out)  Also called a "queue".
    FISH (First In, Still Here)  Also called a "hung printer".
    FIGL (First In, Got Lost)  Also called a bureaucracy.
    LIGL (Last In, Got Lost)  Also called a "streams module".
    FIGO (First In, Garbage Out)  Also called a "random number generator".
    GHNW (Got Here, Now What?)  Also called a "longjmp botch".

*** NOTE:  Disk Space is somewhat short on the system due to the fact that
*** one of the drives is not recognized by any of the drivers in the kernel.
*** Hence, students will be expected to produce a fully functional disk
*** device driver by the end of the second week in order to receive credit
*** for the course.

[ NOTE for those not in the know regarding streams modules:  In the early
  versions, when a module passed data to a printer, when the last chunk
  of data was passed, the module thought it was done and exited, leaving
  the printer sending XOFFs ("My queue's full; STOP!") to the (now non-
  resident) module.  The printer usually lost the last kilobyte or so. ]
