<PRE>Here are more snippets from the one liner file.  While preparing RHF,
I collect short jokes that aren't quite worthy of an individual posting
in the one liner file.  Every so often I put digests of these out to
the group.  (Beware that some readers, such as NN, will mistakenly
present all these items in the digest as individual articles. 
Undigestification is a stupid kludge, but you have to live with it.)

These short items may contain swearing, mature themes and stereotypes.

Subject: An Elegant Insult

Passed on to me by a friend ...

They had a guy on NPR this morning, hawking his new book about
the art of the insult.  His favorite insult of all time took
place between two members of the French legislature (I think;
I didn't pay much attention to the historical details):

  Politician 1:  You, my friend, will surely end up on
    the gallows or poxed.
  Politician 2:  That depends, of course, on whether I
    embrace your philosophy, or your mistress.

Subject: Latest Music Scandal

This occurred to me this morning while I was watching M-TV here in Munich
(its the only English language channel in my hotel).

We've all heard of the Milli Vanilli and Paula Abdul controversies, now
there is a rumor that Bart Simpson is lip-synching on "Do the Bartman".

It seems like someone must have said this before so sorry if it's old, but I
did think of it myself.

Subject: pinball, theory, Howser's Law

This is semi-origional, one of those "over many pitchers of beer" findings.

Howser's Law of Negative Balance (also known as the Pinball Theory of Balance)

"Any situation can be driven to a point of 'negative balance' which is that
point at which whatever you do, including doing nothing, will make matters
worse".  A prime example of this is pinball.  In pinball, when you are really
racking up the points, anything you do will make it more likely that you will
lose the ball or tilt.

   This will appeal to those who were around before timesharing

Subject: Secrets from the gulf war...

It's not very well known yet that the gulf war was actually the first field
test of two US missiles: the Patriot and the Edsel.  The Patriot was built
by the private sector under government contract.  The Edsel was built by
civil service employees.  In its first field test, the Patriot performed
flawlessly.  The Edsel did not do so well.  It had the same problem we
always have with civil service employees: it didn't work and it couldn't be
fired.
