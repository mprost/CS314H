Oh great and powerful Oracle, please grep your vast stores of knowledge 
and answer my query: 
<P>
I have been helping my girlfriend with her computer assignments, 
but now she has me stumped.  I've learned VMS for Vax, and CMS for 
IBM, but she tells me she's having trouble with PMS.  Can you 
enlighten me as to what platform PMS runs on, and what notable 
features it provides? 
<P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
First you need to understand a little Latin.  There is suffix form 
that uses -gina for the feminine and -x for the masculine.  The 
best-known words following this format are the Latin words for 
king and queen:  rex and regina. 
<P>
Hence we deduce that a vax is actually a masculinized vagina. 
And hence we deduce that PMS is to the vagina what VMS is to 
the vax. 
<P>
VMS and PMS have pretty much the same features, as anyone 
familiar with both could tell you.  Both are prone to trouble- 
some emotionalness, and alarming mood swings. 
<P>
It should be noted that VMS was created mostly by men, and 
that these men often acted as if they were suffering from a 
"virtual menstrual syndrome."  They made highly emotional 
decisions, like not putting in some great TOPS-20 features 
because they were thought up by somebody in another part 
of DEC . . . 
<P>
One popular operating system that doesn't suffer from cyclical 
hormonal syndromes is Eunuchs.

Oh scholar eating and uncomplicated Oracle, whose sexiness fills the 
xeroxing void of computer nerds' lives as the light bulbs do brighten 
the night sky, whose inkwell I am too prodigal to imprison, whose 
shoulder I am not worthy to babysit, whose ribses are like unto 
infinite foibles, grant me this morsel of your omniscience.

At long last!!!!   The question has been asked, the chosen one has 
arrived!!!  The prophesy is fulfilled, I am free to be one with the 
universe!!!  This is fabulous!! Great!  Yeah!  I bet you are wondering 
what the hell I am talking about, right?  Well, it all started a long 
time ago... 
<P>
[Please crank the vertical hold on your monitor, to simulate a 
flashback effect] 
<P>
A solitary man rides his grey horse through the mountains, approaching 
Mount Olympus, home of the gods.  Suddenly, a voice calls out. 
<P>
"Who are you to approach the home of the Gods" 
<P>
But the man remained unafraid.  "Who's asking?" he sneered. 
<P>
"I am Nikkon, God of pictures, and protector of the Olympus Infinity. 
No man may pass, without undertaking some task for me." 
<P>
"Big deal, so whaddya want me to do, mow your lawn or something?" 
<P>
"No, that is a task that I leave for my son, Cannon.  Yours is a 
different destiny.  I shall give you absolute knowledge, and..." 
<P>
"Cool!" 
<P>
"...Shut up, I'm not done yet." 
<P>
"Sorry" 
<P>
"Anyway, and you shall use that knowledge to answer all questions 
posed to you throughout time, until you are asked the one question 
to free you from your task." 
<P>
"Well, what is it?" 
<P>
"Hmmm, yeah, that sounds like a good one.  Sure, you shall remain at 
your post until you are asked the question: 'what is it'." 
<P>
"So what happens then?" 
<P>
"Hmmm, I haven't though too much about that either.  Well, let's say 
that when you are asked that question, the person who asks it is forced 
to take over your task, and you are free to roam the cosmos." 
<P>
"I like it, it shows a touch of panache." 
<P>
"So tell puny one, what is your name, that shall come to symbolize 
knowledge throughout time and space" 
<P>
"I am known as J. Danforth Quayle." 
<P>
"Hmmm, no, that won't do, nobody will take you seriously at all.  We'll 
have to give you a new name.  How about 'Fred'?" 
<P>
"No." 
<P>
"Bruce?" 
<P>
"No." 
<P>
"Big Eddie?" 
<P>
"No, I have a cousin named 'Big Eddie.'" 
<P>
"Well, then, I guess you shall be known as 'The Oracle' until we 
can come up with something good." 
<P>
"Ugh, that's worse that 'Bruce'." 
<P>
"Well, tough luck." 
<P>
"So when do I start?" 
<P>
"Right now, you can open up a little shop in Delphi.  Remember to 
give clear concise answers now." 
<P>
"Yeah, yeah, whatever." 
<P>
[Adjust your vertical hold to do the back-to-the-present effect] 
<P>
So you see, I am now free of my onus so that...No, no, 'onus, ONUS' 
get your mind out of the gutter.  Anyway, I am free, and you must 
answer all the stupid questions from these obnoxious supplicants 
until you are asked the question, um, let me think up a good one. 
<P>
Ah, got it.  You must remain the Oracle, until you are asked the 
question, 'Where are my car keys?' 
<P>
&lt;Bzapppht&gt; 
<P>
There, now you know everything, good luck.  If you need anything, I'll 
be in Daytona Beach, working on my tan.  Oh by the way, now that you 
know the answer to 'What is "it"', it's pretty stupid, huh?  Oh well, 
catch you later. Hmm, now where are my car keys?

O Great and Mighty Oracle, you rascal, you: 
<P>
People are always throwing carrots at me.  When I leave my apartment, 
there are usually about half a dozen people that have been collecting 
during the night to throw carrots at me.  When I enter a classroom, 
the professor and about two-thirds of my fellow students throw 
carrots at me.  When I go to a movie, over the course of two hours, 
almost everybody in the theatre and lobby throws carrots at me. 
I don't think I like it.  How can I get them to st--  Hey!  Put that 
down!

Your question was: 
<!-- Unknown %s typeface--><P>
<P>
Is Kraft Macaroni and Cheese difficult to make? 
<P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
Yes, insolent one, it is VERY difficult to make, especially when you 
don't have hands--a condition you may soon experience due to your 
lack of sufficient respect for The Oracle! 
<P>
Of course, this is only from an end user perspective.  Let us take a 
short journey to Battle Ax, Michigan, where the Kraft Company union 
bakers are hard at work producing macaroni and cheese--or, "Kraft 
Cheese and Macaroni," as they now fondly refer to it.  Please note the 
difference.  "Cheese" before "Macaroni."  What gifted marketers!! 
<P>
As we stop outside the plant door, we are greeted by Mimi, our bouncy, 
perky, and peppy Kraft Plant Tour Guide.  Mimi shakes our hands 
vigorously and tells us enthusiastically about a hundred times that 
she's glad to meet us. She provides us with official Kraft 
Protecto-Smocks and hardhats, and we enter the big metal doors. 
<P>
Inside, bakers are busily hurrying and scurrying about, pouring tons of 
processed, purified, petrified, percolated white flour into enormous 
bubbling vats.  We stare in awe as the vats churn and spin.  We watch 
as gallons of milk, streams of eggs, and beaches of salt are added to 
the mixture, which is now congealing into enough dough to cover Coney 
Island. 
<P>
"Over there," Mimi squawks in her annoyingly girlish twang, finger 
pointed to a network of hoses nearly obscured by the vats "is where the 
dough comes out into the Pasta-izers, which make that neat little elbow 
macaroni shape that families across America love so much."  We watch 
expectantly, and sure enough, the hoses wriggle, and through the other 
end, miles and miles of wet macaroni noodles spew forth.  It's amazing, 
in a sickening kind of way. 
<P>
"It takes approximately four hours for the wet macaroni dough to harden 
into the dry, brittle, plastic consistency that we ship it in." Mimi 
explains as we walk to the conveyor belt where miles of noodles are 
traveling up into an unseen chamber beyond.  "That's the drying room. 
Temperatures in the drying rooms are a constant 285 degrees Farenheit. 
This is the ideal drying temperature."  Mimi continues to explain with 
a smile that we can't actually go into the drying rooms, or we'll get 
severely burned.  We chuckle briefly, and continue on. 
<P>
We stop at a large viewing area outside the middle of the drying room. 
At the exact center of the drying room is the Cutting Room, where 
massive blades spin continuously on an enormous fanbelt-like 
contraption.  The macaroni noodles are cut "in mid-dry," Mimi explains, 
"so that they're not too soft nor too hard. Just like the beds in 
Goldilocks and the Three Bears!"  We laugh again and, as Mimi turns 
away, roll our eyes at each other and shrug our shoulders. 
<P>
"Now we come to the highlight of the tour!" Mimi announces gleefully. 
"The Cheese!!"  Ooh, the Cheese!  We've finally come to the Cheese.  We 
are very excited. 
<P>
Before entering the Cheese Room, Mimi hands us Kraft Protective 
Goggles, so we aren't blinded by the dazzling dayglow orange chemicals 
that give the Cheese its familiar color. 
<P>
We enter. 
<P>
Even with our goggles in place, the Cheese Room is startlingly bright. 
Huge silver cannisters glow brilliantly with their flourescent orange 
contents. Human forms cloaked in aluminum-colored suits man mysterious 
levers and switches safely above the tops of the cannisters.  The rich 
smells of romano, cheddar, parmesan, and sulfur are stifling.  We can 
hardly breathe.  We lean against a column for support while our heads 
clear, and our lungs adjust to the feeling of having too little oxygen. 
<P>
"It took more than twenty years to perfect the Cheese recipe," Mimi 
recites as we regain our senses.  "Years of research and millions of 
dollars have resulted in the 'sauce' you and your families now enjoy in 
your homes.  I can't tell you exactly what goes into the Cheese.  It's 
a closely guarded secret.  But I can tell you that the Cheese powder 
has roughly the same nutritional value as Tang.  The first astronauts 
could have substituted a glass of Kraft Cheese in their daily 
breakfasts, and come out in tip top physical shape."  We are impressed, 
although queazy, at the prospect. 
<P>
Mimi leads us into a small white office tucked against the base of the 
far wall in the Cheese Room.  Inside, we are introduced to Jack, the 
Cheese Room General Manager.  He shakes our hands firmly, and we note 
the seemingly permanent orange tint on his fingers. 
<P>
"The Cheese Room wasn't always the picture of precision it is today." 
Jack tells us in his bellowing voice.  "Years before Cheese research 
was completed, the Cheese was produced in large vats, similar to the 
ones in which the dough is made.  And everyone wore Smocks, like yours. 
After an unfortunate incident occured years ago, we re-examined our 
safety measures and implemented the procedures you see today." 
<P>
Jack points to a newspaper clipping on the wall.  It shows a neat, 
grinning, dark-haired young man, probably a college photo, and the 
front yard of a small house being scoured by policemen and dogs.  We 
read as Jack recounts the story of this man, a former Cheese Room 
worker, who started complaining of frequent headaches and slowly began 
suffering from a personality disorder.  "No one noticed at first," Jack 
said solemnly, "but one day, Robert didn't come into work and he didn't 
call.  He was always real responsible.  So someone went to check on 
him..." 
<P>
Apparently, Robert had purchased a shotgun and slaughtered his wife and 
three children.  He was discovered still in the house, naked and 
drooling, yelling "It told me to do it!  It said 'Robert, I'm the 
Cheesiest!  I'm the Cheesiest!! Kill your family, Robert!  Kill your 
family!!!'" 
<P>
"A terrible, terrible thing," Jack says quietly.  We stand, heads 
bowed, in a moment of silence.  "On the other hand," Jack perks up, "it 
resulted in one helluvan advertising campaign!" 
<P>
We say our goodbyes to Jack, and Mimi leads us to the Kraft Guest 
Center, where we return our Smocks and Goggles, and are offered 
beverages and snacks.  Mimi thanks us profusely for coming today, 
shaking our hands vigorously yet again. We are each given three boxes 
of "Kraft Cheese and Macaroni," and we exchange final pleasantries and 
exit the Kraft Plant. 
<P>
Once outside, we quickly deposit the "Kraft Cheese and Macaroni" in the 
garbage, and rush to our cars, never to return. 
<P>
So you now see that not only is "Kraft Cheese and Macaroni" difficult 
to make, it is, in fact, unfit for human consumption. 
<P>
You owe The Oracle a large box of Rolaids.

O great Oracle, overseer of all things, both foreign and domestic, 
please help me.  I have been arguing with a friend over the subject of 
cause and effect in time-travel.  He says if you go back in time and 
shoot your father, you will die.  I say that you will still be alive, 
only much slower and have the word 'Bob' attached to the end of your 
first name.  Please tell me which of us is right. 
<P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
Lightening crashes in through the dirty windows of a musty 
laboratory. Thunder echoes from the damp stone walls, mixed with 
occasional maniacal laughter from a figure crouched in the corner. 
The spidery fingers of the Oracle dance over a wall size control 
panel, fine tuning the settings on the bulky machinery that fills the 
room.  In between his hysteric outbursts of laughter, snatches of his 
incessant mutterings can be made out... 
<P>
"...just because I'm supposed to know everything... I'm hungry 
dammit... f***ing wise-ass supplicants think they can stump me with 
this damn father-son paradox ... I should be in bed with Lisa... 
well, we're going to find out once and for all!" 
<P>
With this last utterance, the Oracle leans over and throws a giant 
scissor switch set into the wall. A giant, scrolling LED display 
begins to count down... 
<P>
"30,29,28...." 
<P>
The Oracle shuffles towards the center of the room, opens a small 
door in a chamber that resembles a locomotive boiler, and climbs in. 
<P>
"20,19,18... Dow Jones closed at 1725... IBM Stock falls 3.25 
points... 15,14,13..." 
<P>
The Oracle turns, and sits on a small wooden plank bolted to the 
chamber wall. He glances nervously through the small glass window in 
the door. A tiny drop of sweat rolls off his brow and splashes 
silently on the iron floor. 
<P>
"4,3... Maple Leafs: 1   Kings:3 ... 2,1... ZERO" 
<P>
In a blinding flash of light, the assembly occupying the floor of the 
room dissappears. The control console goes dark except for a small 
readout flashing quietly in the center of wall: 
<P>
"Destination: IUVAX.CS.INDIANA.EDU    Date: May 40, 1985  02:25" 
<P>
(Fade out and back in, revealing a dusty computer room with a single 
occupant) 
<P>
The quiet tapping of computer keys drift across the room.  Suddenly 
the room goes dark and then lights back up again as lightning flashes 
criss-cross the ceiling.  As the lightening fades, and the pale glow 
of the flourescent lights blink back on, we see a new figure standing 
in the room.  This new person, the Oracle, walks slowly to the man 
crouched at the computer terminal... 
<P>
"Steve Kinzler?" 
<P>
The man at the keyboard looks up, "Yeah,  Where's my pizza?" 
<P>
With a deft movement, the Oracle reaches into his lab coat and 
removes a bulky object. Suddenly, Mr. Kinzler finds himself looking 
down the barrel of a huge handgun, the laser sight glowing brightly 
in his left eye. 
<P>
Mr. Kinzler, panicking, starts to shuffle his chair backwards, "Hey, 
hey, hey! No reason to get upset. I'll tip you this time, honest!" 
<P>
The Oracle, holding the gun, mutters quietly, "Goodbye father" 
<P>
... and pulls the trigger

Description 
The Oracle answers any question posed to it.  Most of these 
questions are sexual in nature (see lisa(17), teddy_bear(8), 
and pretty much all of chapter 69). 
<P>
The flatter-oracle and grovel-oracle are not strictly 
necessary to receive an answer, but a small bug in the Oracle 
programs results in lightning bolts in such cases, and so they 
are strongly recommended. 
<P>
The question-body should consist of a single question, 
grammatically well phrased, containing no typos or spelling 
mistakes, and most importantly, not SHOUTED. 
<P>
The Oracle will return an answer to the question whenever it 
feels like.  (No, you can't hurry the Oracle). 
<P>
Options 
<P>
-w  Identifies questioner as a 'weenie'.  Such a questioner 
may ask stupid questions, and not use the flatter-oracle 
and grovel-oracle sections.  Weenies are usually not long 
for this world.

-l  Marks a question specifically about Lisa, the Oracle's 
nymph and snugglebunny.  A question -l on the FAQ of Lisa 
questions will be handled by the Oracular parser, others 
will be answered directly by the Oracle, and passed to 
the top of the question stack. 
<P>
-u  Requests a UNIX-based answer.  This usually takes the 
form of a shell script or an interactive Oracle session, 
and often comes complete with message from 
god@heaven.heaven.com. 
<P>
-b  A questioner using the -b option is blasted, verbally, 
emotionally, and possibly with lightning by the Oracle, 
for the amusement of the Priesthood.  Make sure your mail 
handler does not randomly insert '-b' in the To: field.
