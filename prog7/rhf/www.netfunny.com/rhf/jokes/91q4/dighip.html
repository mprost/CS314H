 NEW YORK (UPI) --  A creative session was held today at a major New York PR
 firm, to formulate a new corporate message for Digital Equipment Corp. that
 reflects the company's new direction promoting and supporting computing
 industry standards.  The shopworn phrase "Digital has it now" will be
 replaced by a new tag line that is more contemporary, and is tied to DEC's
 new adherence to industry standards.

 "Digital's hip to the standards thing" will become the $11.5 billion
 company's new-image slogan.  In a radical departure from its traditionally
 staid advertising approach, the company will produce a television ad
 built around a rap music theme played out in a rapidly changing sequence of
 office and engineering scenes.

 In a parody of the commonly used product nomenclature, the video itself
 is referred to as "a mythical Digital product called DECrap."  The lyrics
 to the rap video are:

        "Digital's Hip to the Standards Thing"
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    I heard some news just the other day
    It sounded kinda strange and I said, "No way!"
    But I heard it again from another source
    It mighta made sense and I said, "Of course!"

    Now computer biz has a lotta confusion
    'Cause operating systems abound in profusion.
    But there's a whole new wave in data processing
    Now that Digital's hip to the standards thing.

    (chorus)
    Digital's hip to the standards thing!
    Digital's hip to the standards thing!

    Way back when a long time ago
    IBM owned the whole show.
    But other dudes saw this proprietary mess
    And formed committees to find out what's best.

    Some went their own way and built their own software
    But users were perturbed, "It's just a different nightmare."
    So they got together to look over the picks
    Put their down their money on good 'ol UNIX

    (chorus)
    Digital's hip to the standards thing!
    Digital's hip to the standards thing!

    Now Digital always kept their users in mind
    And pushed VMS as the best of the kind.
    A lotta folks agreed but kept askin' for
    UNIX support, "We gotta have more!"

    Soon DEC saw the light and decided to give
    UNIX to the masses, (sorta live and let live).
    So DEC's ridin' the wave ahead of the rest
    On a backplane bogie board on top of the crest.

    No doubt about it DEC's sprouted its wings
    'Cause Digital's hip to the standards thing.

    (chorus)
    Digital's hip to the standards thing!
    Digital's hip to the standards thing!
