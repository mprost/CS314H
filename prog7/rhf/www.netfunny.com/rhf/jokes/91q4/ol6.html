<PRE>Here are more snippets from the one liner file.  While preparing RHF,
I collect short jokes that aren't quite worthy of an individual posting
in the one liner file.  Every so often I put digests of these out to
the group.  (Beware that some readers, such as NN, will mistakenly
present all these items in the digest as individual articles. 
Undigestification is a stupid kludge, but you have to live with it.)

These short items may contain swearing, mature themes and stereotypes.

Subject: New addition to errno.h
From: patterso@usceast.cs.scarolina.edu (Mitchell Patterson)

A new addition to /usr/include/errno.h in the ULTRIX 4.1EP release:

          78  ELVIS   Elvis has been sighted
               A user with the login ``elvis'' has logged in.  ULTRIX
               notifies all users of the sighting and sends a message
               to the Elvis Registry Service at graceland.com.

ULTRIX is a trademark of Digital Electronics Corporation.

This one's mine.  Tom Christiansen (he of Perl fame) had a good one, too;
he said EMACS should be in errno.h: Editor too big.

in a non-union shop.

Q: How does an American change a light bulb?

A: He doesn't.  He throws the lamp away and buys a new one.


   (Minutes after I made this one up, I found a discarded disposable
flashlight on the ground.  Ironic coincidence there.  Naturally I
picked up the litter and dropped the flashlight in a garbage can, but
not before removing the perfectly good light bulb.)
