<PRE>	A friend of mine (Dave) told me this story over the summer,
and swore up and down that it's true (he says he witnessed it).
It sounds a little far-fetched, but is amusing nonetheless.

	Here's the story:

	Dave was standing in the parking lot of a 7-11 store when this
guy walks out of the store with a six pack (of beer he assumes)
in a brown paper sack.  The guy walked between two cars and when
he did, the bag lightly touched one of the cars.  As it turns
out, a guy and his girlfriend were sitting in the car, and the
boyfriend (trying to impress his girlfriend) gets out of the car
and starts bitching at this beer-guy for scratching his car.  So
the beer-guy apologizes but the boyfriend keeps on ranting.
After a while, the beer-guy says, "If it'll make you feel any
better, go over and kick a few dents in my truck" and points to a
beat up pickup truck across the parking lot.  So the boyfriend
goes over and starts kicking the door of the truck in when
another guy walks out of the store and screams "What are you
doing to my truck???".  The boyfriend says, "That guy over there
told me that this was HIS truck" and when he turned around to
look at the beer-guy, he saw him driving off in his car.
