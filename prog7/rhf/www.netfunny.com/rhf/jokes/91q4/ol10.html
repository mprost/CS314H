<PRE>Here are more snippets from the one liner file.  While preparing RHF,
I collect short jokes that aren't quite worthy of an individual posting
in the one liner file.  Every so often I put digests of these out to
the group.  (Beware that some readers, such as NN, will mistakenly
present all these items in the digest as individual articles. 
Undigestification is a stupid kludge, but you have to live with it.)

These short items may contain swearing, mature themes and stereotypes.

I just thought of this so it should be original.
 
Find the largest box you can mail, and mark on the outside

Boy, the legislators in the US, esp. in Illinois.  They are the only ones for
which the following can be said about them:

1.  When a deadline is not met, they get overtime instead of canned.

2.  They are only up for review every two years, or sometimes less often than
    that, unless they really screw up, in which case #3 applies.

3.  Except for the times they are up for review/re-election in #2 above, they
    are really hard to get out of office, and sometimes even harder to find.

It's a well known fact that computing devices such as the abacus were invented
