I recently finished up teaching Comp 4, the computer literacy course here at 
UNC, during a compressed summer session.  Comp 4 is an introductory class that 
assumes NO knowledge of computers among its students, and believe me when I say 
that this was often the case.  The class was great fun to teach, and one of the 
facets that made it interesting (day-in and day-out) was the wealth of new 
knowledge that the students imparted to me on tests and examinations.  I 
thought that I'd share some of these nuggets with you.  My comments are in 
the standard C delimiters (/* and */).  <B>Your</B> comments are encouraged.  Here 
goes: 
<P>
<!--  in 0.15in-->
<blockquote>Bacchus invented FORTRAN.  /* I knew FORTRAN was old, and that it may 
have been designed under the influence of alcohol, but... */ 
<P>
There are three kinds of program statements: sequence, repetition, and 
seduction. 
<P>
There are two types of graphics: vector and rascal.  /* Otay... */ 
<P>
Programming languages have specifictions.  /* Obviously this student 
has dealt with a few standards. */ 
<P>
Macs are compatible with each other.  /* Imagine the alternative: 
"What's your Mac's serial number?  We'll go back to the 
warehouse and get your software." */ 
<P>
Doctors use computers to create a three demential picture of a person's 
brain.  /* Is this classic, or what? */ 
<P>
One kind of a hostile computer program is a Trojan. 
<P>
C is a logical programming language. /* &lt;rim shot&gt; */ 
<P>
Heuristics (from the French heure, "hour") limit the amount of time 
spent executing something.  [When using heuristics] it 
shouldn't take longer than an hour to do something.  /* An 
absolutely terrific "false cognate." */ 
<P>
Having the computer automatically fill in images for animation is 
called "spleening."  /* Derivation: most likely "splines" + 
"tweening." */ 
<P>
One method of computer security is a phone line.  /* She qualified it 
later by adding, "You have to know the number." */ 
<P>
Video games are examples of fault-tolerant systems. 
</blockquote>
<P>
On one test, I gave the students some abbreviations and asked them to tell me 
what they stood for.  You won't believe the creativity of a student in a test 
situation.  For example, one of the abbreviations was "fax," which *really* 
stands for "facsimile."  However, various Comp 4'ers said it stood for: 
<P>
<PRE>	Fiber-optic Aided Xeroxing 
	Frequency Automatic X-rays 
<P>
/* and my favorite... */ 
<P>
	Fast A** Xeroxing 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
The students also had to hand in term papers, and these were rife with 
interesting tidbits.  I've clipped a few, quoted verbatim: 
<P>
<!--  in 0.15in-->
<blockquote>"The worst thing the Mac has to offer, is that cooperative multitasking 
is not available to be used." 
<P>
"... footnotes present an interesting problem, which may be solvable by 
Hypercad."  /* I assume the last term is the newest rage--a 
free-form database for designers. */ 
<P>
"...Linda, a blind girl, was able to attend public school due to the 
aid of a speaking computer that taught her the basic 
fundmamentals [sic] of grammar and spelling."  /* Linda may 
want to lend her computer out... */ 
<P>
"The program is manufactured by Quantel, a Silicon Valley company 
located in Clearwater, Florida."  /* A <B>long</B> valley, as my 
roommate put it. */ 
<P>
"At the beginning of each season [Edwin] Moses teats himself on 
computerized weight machines..."  /* Ouch! */ 
</PRE>
