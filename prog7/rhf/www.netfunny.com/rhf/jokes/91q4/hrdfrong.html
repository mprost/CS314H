There was a professor who was doing experiments with a frog. He was 
teaching a frog to jump. The training went on for a while and finally 
when he said, "Jump!" the frog would jump high in the air. He thought 
it was time to take some measurements and publish the results. 
<P>
He started his measurements with a twine, a ruler and a knife. He 
placed the frog on a wooden cutting plate and said, "jump." It jumped 
and he measured the height it jumped. He wrote in his observation 
note book: "Height jumped (with 4 legs): 14 inches. Inference: None." 
Then he cut one of the legs of the frog and said jump. It jumped to 
a height of 10 inches. Inference: None. Then he cut the next leg, and 
measured the height jumped. Because it had only 2 legs the height 
jumped was only 5 inches. The he cut one more leg and the frog now 
had only one leg. The height jumped was just 1 inch with one leg. 
Again the inference was none. Then he cut the last leg of the frog 
and said, "jump!" It didn't move at all. He wrote his inference in 
the note book: "When all four legs are removed, frogs go deaf." 
<P>
