<PRE>Here are more snippets from the one liner file.  While preparing RHF,
I collect short jokes that aren't quite worthy of an individual posting
in the one liner file.  Every so often I put digests of these out to
the group.  (Beware that some readers, such as NN, will mistakenly
present all these items in the digest as individual articles. 
Undigestification is a stupid kludge, but you have to live with it.)

These short items may contain swearing, mature themes and stereotypes.

1991 _Playboy_.  I've not verified whether this part is fact.

  Atlanta's sports teams are about as pitiful as one could hope.  They
  had a contest recently to choose a slogan for the Braves.  One of
  the entries read, "Go, Braves!  And take the damn Falcons with you!"

Subject: Those who can't teach, teach physical education

Do you know what an assistant dean is?  A mouse in training to be a rat.

those who can't teach, teach teachers.

The rich get richer, the poor get teachers.

Jesus Christ was a good teacher, but he didn't publish.

The above appeared in The Chronicle for Higher Education, page A15
of the May 8, 1991 issue.  I removed them from their context which was an
article about attitudes of academics towards a new emphasis on teaching.
