Dear Doctor Rude, 
<P>
I think I understand what a "platonic kiss" is, but could you 
explain to me the difference between the following kisses? 
<P>

<LI>Hegelian kiss 
<LI>Wittgensteinian kiss 
<LI>Godelian kiss

Dear Flummoxed, 
<P>
That's a very good question; nowadays most sex education courses focus on 
secondary and tertiary sources, so much so that few people really get exposed 
to the classics in this field any more.  I'll try to make a brief but clear 
summary of some of these important types of kisses: 
<P>
<B>Aristotelian kiss --</B> 
a kiss performed using techniques gained solely 
from theoretical speculation untainted by any experiential data 
by one who feels that the latter is irrelevant anyway. 
<P>
<B>Hegelian kiss --</B> 
a dialiptical technique in which the kiss incorporates 
its own antithikiss, forming a synthekiss. 
<P>
<B>Wittgensteinian kiss --</B> 
the important thing about this type of kiss is 
that it refers only to the symbol (our internal mental 
<B>representation we associate with the experience of the kiss-- 
which 
must necessarilly also be differentiated from the act itself for 
obvious reasons and which need not be by any means the same or even 
similar for the different people experiencing the act) rather than 
the act itself and, as such, one must be careful not to make 
unwarranted generalizations about the act itself or the experience 
thereof based merely on our manipulation of the symbology therefor. 
<P>
<B>Godelian kiss --</B> 
a kiss that takes an extraordinarilly long time, yet 
leaves you unable to decide whether you've been kissed or not. 
<P>
Now, this is by no means an exhaustive list--here are just a few other 
classic kisses: 
<P>
<B>Socratic kiss --</B> 
actually really a Platonic kiss, but it's claimed to be 
the Socratic technique so it'll sound more authoritative; however, 
compared to most strictly Platonic kisses, Socratic kisses wander 
around a lot more and cover more ground. 
<P>
<B>Kantian kiss --</B> 
a kiss that, eschewing inferior "phenomenal" contact, is 
performed entirely on the superior "noumenal" plane; though you don't 
actually feel it at all, you are, nonetheless, free to declare it 
the best kiss you've ever given or received. 
<P>
<B>Kafkaesque kiss --</B> 
a kiss that starts out feeling like it's about to 
transform you but ends up just bugging you. 
<P>
<B>Sartrean kiss --</B> 
a kiss that you worry yourself to death about even 
though it really doesn't matter anyway. 
<P>
<B>Russell-Whiteheadian kiss --</B> 
a formal kiss in which each lip and 
tongue movement is rigorously and completely defined, even 
though it ends up seeming incomplete somehow. 
<P>
<B>Hertzsprung-Russellian kiss --</B> 
Oh, Be A Fine Girl/Guy, Kiss Me. 
<P>
<B>Pythagorean kiss --</B> 
a kiss given by someone who has developed some new 
and wonderful techniques but refuses to use them on anyone for fear 
that others would find out about them and start using them. 
<P>
<B>Cartesian kiss --</B> 
A particularly well-planned and coordinated movement: 
"I think, therefore, I aim."  In general, a kiss does not count as 
Cartesian unless it is applied with enough force to remove all doubt 
that one has been kissed.  (cf. Polar kiss, a more well-rounded 
movement involving greater nose-to-nose contact, but colder 
overall.) 
<P>
<B>Heisenbergian kiss --</B> 
a hard-to-define kiss--the more it moves you, the 
less sure you are of where the kiss was; the more energy it has, the 
more trouble you have figuring out how long it lasted.  Extreme 
versions of this type of kiss are known as "virtual kisses" because 
the level of uncertainty is so high that you're not quite sure if 
you were kissed or not.  Virtual kisses have the advantage, however, 
that you need not have anyone else in the room with you to enjoy 
them. 
<P>
<B>Nietzscheian kiss --</B> 
"she/he who does not kiss you, makes your lust 
stronger." 
<P>
<B>Epimenidian kiss --</B> 
a kiss given by someone who does not kiss. 
<P>
<B>Grouchoic kiss --</B> 
a kiss given by someone who will only kiss those who 
would not kiss him or her. 
<P>
<B>Harpoic kiss --</B> 
shut up and kiss me. 
<P>
<B>Zenoian kiss --</B> 
your lips approach, closer and closer, but never 
actually touch. 
<P>
<B>Procrustean kiss --</B> 
well, suffice it to say that it is a technique 
that, once you've experienced it, you'll never forget it, 
especially when applied to areas of the anatomy other than the 
lips.
