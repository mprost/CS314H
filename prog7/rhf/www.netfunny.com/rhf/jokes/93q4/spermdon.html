<PRE>Wasted Resources/Missed Opportunities

by A. Kohn and F Fish
Orgenics, Yavne, Israel

In the July 6, 1992, issue of Time International we are informed
that the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 100 million acts
of human sexual intercourse occur each day but that only 910,000 of
them result in conception. The rest are simply wasted. Thus more
than 99 million acts of intercourse are squandered and have no
practical results except momentary pleasure for the participants.

If one takes into account the volume of the lost sperm, assuming at
least 5 mL per act of intercourse, we may calculate that about
5 x 10E-3 x 99 x 10E6 or 500 cubic meters of fertil fluid are wasted 
per day. This brings the number to 15,000 cubic meters per month!

Assuming that the need for irrigation of an acre or agricultural land
in arid areas is about 40 cubic meters per acre per month, we find
that the available volume of sperm would be sufficient to irrigate,
as wall as fertilize, about 350 acres of land.

In addition, the squandered acts of intercourse require energy that
may be calculated to be equivalent to about 300 kcal per act of
intercourse. Thus the redundant energy--if properly harnessed--
would be sufficient to operate a power station and to supply
1500 mW/day, enough for a city the size of New York.

These energy calculations can be made more accessible to the 
layperson. Let us say that the starter motor in your car has a 
power requirement of 500W. Thus the energy wasted on nonproductive
acts of intercourse would be sufficient to start three million
cars. If you cannot start your car on a cold morning in winter,
think of your neighbors having wasted all that energy the night
before, enjoying themselves with their partners.
