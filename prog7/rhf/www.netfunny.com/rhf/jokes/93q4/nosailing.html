<P>
I just got back from a sailing holiday where I remembered this true tale 
you might be interested in. 
<P>
A friend was looking for a second hand boat (a Laser) to buy, when he 
hit on a great idea... 
<P>
At his sailing club (the Queen Mary in London) there was a large trailer 
park and a smaller yard where the management put trailers and boats if 
the owner didn't pay their membership for 12 months. The Queen Mary club 
is very big and at the time there were three or four Lasers in this 
yard that judging from their condition hadn't been sailed for at least 
a year. 
<P>
My friend took down the numbers of these boats and asked the club secretary 
for the owners address so that he could make them an offer. The first chap 
he rang said he wasn't interested in selling as he was going to sail it 
himself "one of these days." 
<P>
He then rang the second owner who lived about 100 miles away. A woman 
answered the phone and confirmed that they did still own the Laser. My 
friend explained that he had seen it in the defaulters yard and that as it 
clearly hadn't been sailed for a year - did she think her husband would be 
interested in selling? 
<P>
"Oh no" she said, "there must be some mistake - come rain or shine my husband 
spends one weekend a month in London sailing..." 
<P>
I bet he had some explaining to do when he got home! 
<P>
