A young lady had unwantedly become pregnant and wanted an abortion. 
Unfortunately, a medical examination showed she could not and when 
told so by her doctor she broke down and cried. "I can't have a baby 
now," she said, "There must be something you can do!"  The doctor 
thought about this for a while, and suddenly he came up with an idea: 
"There is bound to be someone in this hospital in for an appendix 
operation when you give birth, and we'll just give her the baby and 
tell her it wasn't the appendix after all." 
<P>
The young lady agreed to his plan, but at the time she was giving birth 
there were no women in for appendix operation in the hospital, in fact 
the only person who was was an old priest. The doctor, desperately 
realizing the gravity of the situation and his promise, figured he 
might as well try anyway. 
<P>
The priest was overwhelmed. Convinced this was an immaculate 
conception he took his little son home. The years passed and his son 
grew to become a fine boy. The priest was getting old, and finally he 
he called his son to his deathbed. 
<P>
"There is something I have to tell you," said the priest, 
"I am not your father." His son looked at him in surprise. 
The priest went on; "I am your mother, the bishop is your father."
