Taken from the May/June 1989 Utne Reader, which took this from 
Shawn Gosieski, New Cyclist, Fall 1988.  (and it has come in from 
other sources -ed) 
<P>
A Zen teacher saw five of his students returning from the market, 
riding their bicycles.  When they arrived at the monastery and had dismounted, 
the teacher asked the students, "Why are you riding your bicycles?" 
<P>
The first student replied, "The bicycle is carrying the sack of 
potatoes.  I am glad that I do not have to carry them on my back!"  The 
teacher praised the first student, "You are a smart boy!  When you grow 
old, you will not walk hunched over like I do." 
<P>
The second student replied, "I love to watch the trees and fields 
pass by as I roll down the path!"  The teacher commended the second student, 
"Your eyes are open, and you see the world." 
<P>
The third student replied, "When I ride my bicycle, I am content 
to chant nam myoho renge kyo."  The teacher gave praise to the third student, 
"Your mind will roll with the ease of a newly trued wheel." 
<P>
The fourth student replied, "Riding my bicycle, I live in harmony 
with all sentient beings."  The teacher was pleased, and said to the fourth 
student, "You are riding on the golden path of non-harming." 
<P>
The fifth student replied, "I ride my bicycle to ride my 
bicycle."  The teacher sat at the feet of the fifth student and said, 
"I am your student!"
