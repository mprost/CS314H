This one may be old on the net (I certainly heard it a number of years ago), 
but in case you haven't heard it before, here goes a story the Polish tell 
about Russians... 
<P>
A Russian party-official arrives late at night to his hotel (in Russia). He 
is not surprised to find that his reservation has been mislaid but he is 
more than a little peeved that his status in the party isn't enough to get 
him a good room anyway. However, the clerk insists, the only bed they have 
left is the fourth bunk in a 4-bed dorm--he'll have to make do with that. 
The Russian grumbles but eventually he picks up his suitcase and heads for 
the dorm. On his way, he meets a chamber-maid and thinking he might as well 
try to make friends with his room-mates, he asks her to bring them four cups 
of tea. 
<P>
As he enters the dorm, he finds that the other three guests are Polish, they 
are having a fairly wild party and they're <EM>very</EM> drunk. They also ignore him 
totally from the moment he enters. After sitting there for several minutes, 
he realizes he can't stand them anymore and decides to pull a joke on them. 
He stands up, grasps a floor lamp and speaking into the light-bulb as if it 
were a microphone he says: 
<P>
"Comrade Colonel, we would like four cups of tea to our room immediately!" 
The Poles stare at him in disbelief, which turns to horror as the chamber-maid 
knocks on the door and delivers the tea a few minutes later. In about 30 
seconds the Poles have all packed their bags and fled the hotel. Our Russian 
gets the entire room to himself. He sleeps very soundly. 
<P>
The next morning, however, as he's checking out and is about to leave, the 
desk-clerk calls after him: 
<P>
"By the way, Sir, the Comrade Colonel said to tell you he appreciated your 
little joke last night!" 
<P>
As I said, this is a joke the Polish tell about Russians...
