I got this from a neighbor who works for a fish packing company... 
<P>
NEWS BULLETIN!!! 
<P>
Today, in a tragic accident at the Exxon corporate headquarters, the 
fish truck "Prince William Express" slammed into the side of the main 
building of the new corporate headquarters spilling more than 20 tons 
of dead herring, salmon, sea otters and various other wildlife on to 
the pristine lawn of the Exxon complex. 
<P>
Skipper Joe Woodhead was passed out the in the sleeper compartment of the 
state-of-the-art fish truck when the truck struck the clearly-marked 
building.  "Bobo," the skipper's dog, had the wheel at the time of 
the accident.  Bobo, whose certification does not permit him to drive 
on planet earth, was unavailable for comment, and confirmed sources 
suggest he has a history of drug abuse. 
<P>
The skipper contends that he was not drunk at the time of the 
accident, but when he realized the seriousness of the spill he ran 
out to a local tavern and pounded down a half-dozen beers.  Woodhead 
also contends that he told Bobo to give him a "Bud light," not a "hard 
right." 
<P>
The President of the Prince William Express Co. said that they would 
assume full responsibility for the spill and would submit a plan in 
about a month on the proposed clean-up procedure.  He also stated 
that they ship over a million tons of seafood a year and that an 
accident like this is just the price we have to pay to eat fish. 
<P>
When asked about the clean-up equipment for such a spill, company 
officials commented that a small pickup with a shovel in it was in 
Gopher Spits, Iowa, but had a flat tire and therefore would be unable 
to be dispatched to the scene. 
<P>
On the market side of things, fish prices will increase by 20% for 
all species. 
<P>
Vice President Dan Quail flew to the Texaco headquarters today and 
reported that there appeared to be no damage, and was returning to 
Washington, DC.
