(I don't remember where I heard this, but I don't think it was in church...) 
<P>
During a particularly wet winter, flood waters rise so high in one 
town that the national guard evacuates all the residents.  One man 
stays behind, however, and when the water is waist-high, two national 
guardsmen in a boat motor past his house, checking for people left 
behind. 
<P>
"We're evacuating the town because of the flood!  Jump in the boat 
and we'll carry you to safety!" 
<P>
But the man says, "No, don't bother; I've led a pious life, and the 
Lord will save me." 
<P>
The men in the boat shrug their shoulders and motor away.  Later, 
when the water level has driven the man onto his roof, another boat 
appears. 
<P>
"Haven't you heard the town has been evacuated?  Come on, we'll save 
you!" 
<P>
But the man sends them away again, saying "No, no, the Lord will save 
me!" 
<P>
The water level keeps rising until the man is standing on his chimney 
and barely keeping his head above water, and a helicopter, doing a 
final check, appears overhead.  It drops a rope, and the loudspeaker 
says, "Grab the rope and we'll bring you to safety!" 
<P>
But the man waves the helicopter away, once again saying, "No, the 
Lord will save me!" 
<P>
But the water level keeps rising, and he drowns. 
<P>
When he gets to heaven, he is completely bewildered.  He asks God, 
"God, why didn't you save me?" 
<P>
And God says, "Well, I sent you two boats and a helicopter." 
<P>
