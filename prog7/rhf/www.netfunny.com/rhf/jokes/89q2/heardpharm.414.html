(From: Greg Ryding) 
<P>
Time: Early Sixties.  Place: Yourtown, USA 
<P>
A young unmarried couple decides after a few dates that 
they are going to sleep together.  So, the guy, Tom, goes to 
the local pharmacy to buy some condoms. 
<P>
Tom goes up to the pharmacy counter and asks the 
pharmacist for some Trojans, (just like the kid in Summer of 
'42).  The pharmacist looks at Tom disgustedly and says, 
"What's wrong with you kids today, ya go on two dates and you 
wanna go to bed with each other.  Why can't ya save sex for 
when ya get married.  You should wait until you're married! 
Sex before marriage is a sin ya know." 
<P>
Well Tom calmed down the pharmacist and explained that 
his generation was a little different.  He said that he and 
his girlfriend were just trying to act responsibly and take 
precautions against pregnancy and disease.  The pharmacist 
conceded that times were changing and finally sold him the 
condoms. 
<P>
That same night Tom was invited over to his girlfriend 
Katey's house for dinner with the family.  When they all sat 
down, Tom asked Katey's father if he could say grace.  Her 
father said yes and Tom proceeded to say a beautiful eleven 
minute grace thanking everyone from the Pilgrims to the 
President for the meal they were about to eat. 
<P>
After dinner Katey took Tom aside and smiling, said, 
"Tom, you never told me you were so religious!"  Tom smiled 
back and said, "Well, Katey, you never told me your father was 
a pharmacist." 
<P>
