<H4>The Cat in the Hat</H4>
<P>
by Dr. Seuss, 61 pages.  Beginner Books, $3.95 
<P>
The Cat in the Hat is a hard-hitting novel of prose and poetry 
in which the author re-examines the dynamic rhyming schemes and 
bold imagery of some of his earlier works, most notably <I>Green 
Eggs and Ham</I>, <I>If I Ran the Zoo</I>, and <I>Why Can't I Shower With 
Mommy?</I>  In this novel, Theodore Geisel, writing under the 
pseudonym Dr. Seuss, pays homage to the great Dr. Sigmund Freud 
in a nightmarish fantasy of a renegade feline helping two young 
children understand their own frustrated sexuality. 
<P>
The story opens with two youngsters, a brother and a sister, 
abandoned by their mother, staring mournfully through the 
window of their single-family dwelling.  In the foreground, a 
large tree/phallic symbol dances wildly in the wind, taunting 
the children and encouraging them to succumb to the sexual 
yearnings they undoubtedly feel for each other.  Even to the 
most unlearned reader, the blatant references to the 
incestuous relationship the two share set the tone for Seuss' 
probing examination of the satisfaction of primitive needs. 
The Cat proceeds to charm the wary youths into engaging in 
what he so innocently refers to as "tricks."  At this point, 
the fish, an obvious Christ figure who represents the 
prevailing Christian morality, attempts to warn the children, 
and thus, in effect, warns all of humanity of the dangers 
associated with the unleashing of the primal urges.  In 
response to this, the cat proceeds to balance the aquatic 
naysayer on the end of his umbrella, essentially saying, 
"Down with morality; down with God!" 
<P>
After poohpoohing the righteous rantings of the waterlogged 
Christ figure, the Cat begins to juggle several icons of 
Western culture, most notably two books, representing the Old 
and New Testaments, and a saucer of lactal fluid, an ironic 
reference to maternal loss the two children experienced when 
their mother abandoned them "for the afternoon."  Our heroic 
Id adds to this bold gesture a rake and a toy man, and thus 
completes the Oedipal triangle. 
<P>
Later in the novel, Seuss introduces the proverbial Pandora's 
box, a large red crate out of which the Id releases Thing One, 
or Freud's concept of Ego, the division of the psyche that 
serves as the conscious mediator between the person and 
reality, and Thing Two, the Superego which functions to reward 
and punish through a system of moral attitudes, conscience, 
and guilt.  Referring to this box, the Cat says, "Now look at 
this trick.  Take a look!"  In this, Dr. Seuss uses the 
children as a brilliant metaphor for the reader, and asks the 
reader to re-examine his own inner self. 
<P>
The children, unable to control the Id, Ego, and Superego 
allow these creatures to run free and mess up the house, or 
more symbolically, control their lives.  This rampage 
continues until the fish, or Christ symbol, warns that the 
mother is returning to reinstate the Oedipal triangle that 
existed before her abandonment of the children.  At this 
point, Seuss introduces a many-armed cleaning device which 
represents the psychoanalytic couch, which proceeds to put 
the two youngsters' lives back in order. 
<P>
With powerful simplicity, clarity, and drama, Seuss reduces 
Freud's concepts on the dynamics of the human psyche to an 
easily understood gesture.  Mr. Seuss' poetry and choice of 
words is equally impressive and serves as a splendid 
counterpart to his bold symbolism.  In all, his writing style 
is quick and fluid, making <I>The Cat in the Hat</I> impossible to 
put down.  While this novel is 61 pages in length, and one 
can read it in five minutes or less, it is not until after 
multiple readings that the genius of this modern day master 
becomes apparent.
