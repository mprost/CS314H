<P>
A flight attendant friend of mine and her boyfriend had been playing a little 
game, where they would hide condoms in each other's pockets, briefcases, 
lunches etc., to have them revealed at unexpected times. 
<P>
One morning, shortly after taking off on a 3 hour flight, the flight 
attendant was asked for aspirin, by a man with a headache.  Recalling the 
packet of aspirin she usually kept in her left pocket, she took it out, 
placed it on the man's fold out table, and turned to pour him a glass of water. 
<P>
When she turned around again, the man was staring, mouth open, at the 
packet before him. He managed to stammer "Sorry Miss, I really DO have a 
headache."  On discovering her mistake, she turned several shades of red, 
and scurried off to hide in the crew cabin. 
<P>
Eventually, she had to resume her duties, and on each pass down the aisle, 
she got a wink and a smile from the man with the headache.
