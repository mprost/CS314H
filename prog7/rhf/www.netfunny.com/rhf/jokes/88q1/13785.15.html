MESSAGE FROM THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON TO THE BRITISH FOREIGN 
OFFICE IN LONDON--written from Central Spain, August 1812 
<P>
Gentlemen, 
<P>
Whilst marching from Portugal to a position which commands the 
approach to Madrid and the French forces, my officers have been 
diligently complying with your requests which have been sent by 
H.M. ship from London to Lisbon and thence by dispatch to our 
headquarters. 
<P>
We have enumerated our saddles, bridles, tents and tent poles, 
and all manner of sundry items for which His Majesty's 
Government holds me accountable.  I have dispatched reports on 
the character, wit, and spleen of every officer.  Each item and 
every farthing has been accounted for, with two regrettable 
exceptions for which I beg your indulgence. 
<P>
Unfortunately the sum of one shilling and ninepence remains 
unaccounted for in one infantry battalion's petty cash and there 
has been a hideous confusion as the the number of jars of 
raspberry jam issued to one cavalry regiment during a sandstorm 
in western Spain.  This reprehensible carelessness may be 
related to the pressure of circumstance, since we are war with 
France, a fact which may come as a bit of a surprise to you 
gentlemen in Whitehall. 
<P>
This brings me to my present purpose, which is to request 
elucidation of my instructions from His Majesty's Government so 
that I may better understand why I am dragging an army over 
these barren plains.  I construe that perforce it must be one of 
two alternative duties, as given below.  I shall pursue either 
one with the best of my ability, but I cannot do both: 
<P>
1.  To train an army of uniformed British clerks in Spain for 
the benefit of the accountants and copy-boys in London or 
perchance. 
<P>
2.  To see to it that the forces of Napoleon are driven out of 
Spain. 
<P>
Your most obedient servant, 
<P>
Wellington 
<P>
