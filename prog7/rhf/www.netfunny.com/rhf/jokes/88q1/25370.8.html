<P>
John's girlfriend had long been complaining that she wasn't getting 
satisfied, because his dick was too short.  And now she had announced 
that she was going to leave him, and find a bigger guy.  John didn't 
think he could stand to lose her, since everything else about their 
relationship was wonderful.  He begged her to stay with him a little 
longer, and he promised he'd figure out something. 
<P>
She agreed to give him a week.  In desperation, John went to see a 
doctor, to ask if there was anything that could be done.  At first, the 
doctor said no, there really wasn't anything that could be done.  When 
John wasn't convinced, the doctor said well, maybe the new experimental 
... no, better not even consider that.  It was too new, and there wasn't 
enough information about what might go wrong. 
<P>
John wasn't having any of that.  He said he was desperate, and he'd try 
anything, if it would give him a longer penis.  After some argument, the 
doctor agreed to send him to the university hospital for the operation, 
which consisted of attaching the end of a baby elephant's trunk to his 
penis, but repeated that he definitely didn't recommend this operation 
and wouldn't take any responsibility for the results. 
<P>
John had the operation, it was a success, and within the week, John was 
ready to put his new tool to work.  He was really going to surprise his 
girlfriend with this thing.  She'd be delighted--it was really big! 
<P>
First he took her out to a fancy restaurant, and they had a perfect 
meal.  As they were finishing up dinner, John got a devilish idea.  He 
unzipped his fly under the tablecloth, and took it out.  Then, before 
he knew what was happening, this "penis" snaked up over the edge of the 
table, and started feeling around.  It found a hard roll, and with a 
little sniffing sound, grabbed the roll, and zipped back under the 
tablecloth. 
<P>
John's girlfriend was delighted!  "Can you do that again?" she asked. 
John replied, "Uh, I think so, but I don't think my ass can take another 
one of those rolls."
