This isn't mine, I heard it on the radio this morning. 
<P>
Man's wife asks him to go to the store to buy some cigarettes.  So he walks 
down to the store only to find it closed.  So he goes into a nearby bar to 
use the vending machine.  At the bar he sees a beautiful woman and starts 
talking to her.  They have a couple of beers and one thing leads to another 
and they end up in her apartment.  After they've had their fun, he realizes 
its 3AM and says, "Oh no, its so late, my wife's going to kill me.  Have you 
got any talcum powder?"  She gives him some talcum powder, which he proceeds 
to rub on his hands and then he goes home. 
<P>
His wife is waiting for him in the doorway and she is pretty pissed. 
"Where the hell have you been?!?!" 
<P>
"Well, honey, its like this.  I went to the store like you asked, but they 
were closed.  So I went to the bar to use the vending machine.  I saw this 
great looking chick there and we had a few drinks and one thing led to 
another and I ended up in bed with her." 
<P>
"Oh yeah?  Let me see your hands!" 
<P>
She sees his hands are covered with powder and... 
"You God damn liar!!!  You went bowling again!!!"
