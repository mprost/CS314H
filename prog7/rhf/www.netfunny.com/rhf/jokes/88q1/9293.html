<P>
A game warden came upon a duck hunter who had bagged 3 
ducks and decided to "enforce the laws pending."  He 
stopped the hunter, flashed his badge and said, "Looks 
like you've had a pretty good day.  Mind if I inspect 
your kill?" 
<P>
The hunter shrugged and handed the ducks 
to the warden.  The warden took one of the ducks, inserted 
his finger into the duck's rectum, pulled it out, sniffed 
it, and said, "This here's a Washington state duck.  Do 
you have a Washington state hunting license?" 
<P>
The hunter 
pulled out his wallet and calmly showed the warden a 
Washington state hunting license.  The warden took a 
second duck, inserted his finger in the bird's rectum, 
pulled it out, sniffed it, and said, "This here's an 
Idaho duck.  Do you have an Idaho state hunting license?" 
<P>
The hunter, a bit put out, produced an Idaho state hunting 
license.  The warden took a third duck, conducted 
the same finger test, and said, "This here's an Oregon 
state duck.  Do you have an Oregon state hunting license?" 
<P>
Once again, only this time more aggravated, the hunter 
produced the appropriate license.  The warden, a little 
miffed at having struck out, handed the ducks back to 
the hunter and said, "You've got all of these licenses, 
just where the hell are you from?" 
<P>
The hunter dropped his pants, bent over, and said 
"You're so smart, YOU tell ME!"
