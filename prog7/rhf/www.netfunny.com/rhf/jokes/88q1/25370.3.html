<P>
A judge in a semi-small city was hearing a drunk-driving case and the 
defendent, who had both a record and a reputation for driving under the 
influence, demanded a jury trial.  It was nearly 4 p.m. and getting a 
jury would take time, so the judge called a recess and went out in the 
hall looking to impanel anyone available for jury duty.  He found a 
dozen lawyers in the main lobby and told them that they were a jury. 
<P>
The lawyers thought this would be a novel experience and so followed 
the judge back to the courtroom.  The trial was over in about 10 
minutes and it was very clear that the defendent was guilty.  The jury 
went into the jury-room, the judge started getting ready to go home, 
and everyone waited. 
<P>
After nearly three hours, the judge was totally out of patience and 
sent the bailiff into the jury-room to see what was holding up the 
verdict.  When the bailiff returned, the judge said, "Well have they 
got a verdict yet?" 
<P>
The bailiff shook his head and said, "Verdict?  Hell, they're still 
doing nominating speeches for the foreman's position!" 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The defendent who pleads their own case has a fool for a client, but at 
least there will be no problem with fee-splitting.
