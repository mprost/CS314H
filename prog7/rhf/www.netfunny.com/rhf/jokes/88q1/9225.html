FOODPORN: Pornography for dieters (?) by Frank LaRosa 
<P>
Brought to you by Searchlight bbs 516-724-0971 
<P>
Dear Editors, 
<P>
I read your fine magazine eagerly each month, and one of my 
favorite features is the letters you receive from your readers. I 
always enjoy hearing about their exploits, but until now I never 
thought anything like that could ever happen to me. However all that 
changed last Friday night, when I had one of the most incredible 
experiences of my life, and felt I just had to write and share it 
with everyone. 
<P>
It was about 10:30 PM and I was sitting in my dorm room going 
over some boring math homework that I really didn't feel like doing. 
Normally there is plenty to do on Friday nights at my college, but it 
was the first day of spring break and the campus was practically 
deserted. Since I couldn't afford to go to Florida with my buddies, 
I was forced to spend the vacation on campus by myself. I was fully 
expecting a rather dull week of nothing but studying and watching TV. 
<P>
Anyway, I was concentrating on my math book when suddenly I 
heard a loud bang and a screech coming from outside. I rushed to the 
window to see what had happened. On the street below I saw a white 
minivan with the words "Carlo's Italian Restaurant" on the side. The 
van pulled slowly to the side of the road, obviously suffering from 
a tire blowout. Relieved at an excuse to break up the monotony of my 
studying, I decided to go outside and see if I could be of any help. 
<P>
As I approached the van I could see the driver, an overweight, 
brown haired woman who introduced herself as Gail. We both examined 
the flat tire and I asked Gail where she was heading. She said she 
was supposed to deliver an order of Italian food to a party, some 
rich eccentrics who lived in the upper part of town, she said. But 
the party had been cancelled at the last minute and she was 
returning with their order. She said she didn't think there was a 
spare tire in the van but I suggested that we take a look anyway. 
<P>
We went around to the back of the van and Gail opened the rear 
doors. A warm rush of steam came from inside, carrying the rich 
scent of fresh tomato sauce and Italian bread. In the cargo area 
were trays and trays of lasagna, meatballs, and pork smothered in 
sauce. A stack of pizza boxes lay to one side, and I could see what 
looked like a case of beer towards the back. Never in my wildest 
fantasies had I seen anything like the banquet that lay before me 
now. After living on lousy school cafeteria food for the past two 
months, it all seemed something like a dream come true. 
<P>
Gail looked around and said she couldn't find the spare tire. 
She sighed, giving me a strangely seductive look. "Well," she said, 
"I guess I won't be able to get back to the restaurant for a while. 
It would sure be a shame to let all this food go to waste." At that, 
I knew something incredible was about to happen. Gail manouvered her 
pudgy frame into the back of the truck. I couldn't believe my eyes 
as she began unwrapping the mountain of food before us. "Here," she 
said, handing me a huge tray of lasagna. The dish was warm and heavy 
and full of rich Italian smells. When I looked back I noticed that 
Gail had started without me and was already busy with a large, 
greasy pepperoni pizza. 
<P>
I sat on the edge of the van and removed the tin foil from the 
lasagna tray. I peeled the foil back slowly, carefully, revealing 
the hot pleasures within. The sauce oozed like lava around the melty 
mozarella cheese, and pools of oil were everywhere. I ran my finger 
along the edge of the plate, and then gently through the heart of 
the food, delighting in the warm, slippery feel of the pasta 
underneath. After a few minutes of working my fingers in and out I 
removed them and slowly licked off the sweet-tasting sauce. 
<P>
My sense of hunger heightened, I lifted the tray closer to my 
face. My hands sank into the center of the lasagna, scooping out 
huge globs of pasta, sauce, and cheese. I lifted the food to my 
mouth and stuffed it sloppily into my waiting hole. I chewed and 
swallowed deeply, my eyes closed in ecstasy. My entire digestive 
tract tingled as the food made its way down my esophagus and into 
the pit of my stomach. Incensed, I grabbed hungrily for the lasagna, 
stuffing my mouth till it was about to burst, choking it down so 
fast that it almost hurt, and stuffing my face again. In a matter of 
minutes I had lapped up the entire tray, licking it clean so as to 
get every drop. 
<P>
I stood up and caught my breath. After such a feast I was sure I 
could eat no more, but the sight of several open pizza boxes soon 
had me going again. Reaching out, I tore off about half of a huge 
15 inch pizza covered with pepperoni, mushrooms, and sausage. I 
folded the thick dough and thrust the pizza mouthward, alternately 
chewing at the crust and then sucking in the tender, cheesy filling. 
My mind in a blissful daze, I spent the next several minutes in this 
position, until I had devoured every last mouthful. 
<P>
By this time Gail had discovered the beer, and she handed me a 
tall, frosty bottle. I wrenched off the cap and lifted the beer to 
my mouth, pouring it eagerly down my throat. As I drank in a frenzy, 
beer spilled out the corners of my mouth and dripped onto my face, 
neck and clothing. Oblivious to the world, I continued consuming the 
brew like a madman until every drop was gone. 
<P>
Finally, I could take no more. Grasping my stomach, I stumbled 
towards the grass on the side of the road. I opened my mouth and 
burped into the warm night, longer and louder than I had ever done 
before. The substance of my belch seemed to hang in the air in front 
of me, thick with the aroma of pizza and beer. I burped a second 
time, then lay on the soft ground and fell into a deep, satisfying 
sleep. 
<P>
When I awoke several hours later, Gail and the restaurant van 
were gone. I never saw them again after that night, but the fond 
memories of our encounter will stay with me forever. Perhaps someday 
I'll meet Gail again, and if I do I'll be sure to write and tell you 
all about it.
