<P>
Join the dynamic team here at SoulWaste.  We want people who 
believe in the hi-tech religion and who are willing to work 60 hour 
weeks under florescent lights in grey buildings with windows that 
don't open.  After all, the earth will stop rotating on its axis 
if our product doesn't get out the door before the competition. 
<P>
You must be a mindless zealot who's idea of a good time is 
playing MacIntosh computer games on nights and weekends and who's 
conversations with other people sound like a Wang commercial. 
You must believe in the Yuppie vision of the world as shown in 
Wang, H-P, and AT&amp;T commercials where people are shown thinking 
about their job while swimming or walking their dog and where 
everybody is inadequate if they haven't purchased the latest 
wiz-bang box or felt anxious guilt if their office system isn't 
networked to everything more hi-tech than a Smith-Corona typewriter. 
<P>
Yes, we don't just want your hours at SoulWaste--we want 
your soul!! 
<P>
Qualifications: 
<P>
<!--  list-->
<OL><LI>Must be willing to sacrifice any semblance of 
real life for carrots held at the end of sticks 
i.e. BIG BUCKS. 
<LI>Must have huge repertoire of computer buzzwords 
in vocabulary. 
<LI>Must feel the same degree of mania as company 
management when products are late getting out 
the door. 
<LI>Must have no social life--'cause we're gonna 
fatigue you so much you ain't gonna have one 
anyway. 
<LI>Oh, yeah, must know the C programming language. 
</OL>
<P>
Direct inquiries to this dynamic and growing conspiracy, I mean, er, 
company to:
