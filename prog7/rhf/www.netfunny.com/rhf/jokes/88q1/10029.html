Cromwell and Rasputin<BR>
by<BR>
as submitted to<BR>

The following essay was an actual submission by a  student,  who  was  given  the assignment: ``Write a term paper 
comparing and contrasting two revolutionary figures of  your 
choice.   The  figures  are  to  be  selected from different 
periods of European history.'' 
<P>
Unlike most papers of student bloopers, which are  collaborative 
efforts,  this one is the work of the exceptionally fruitful pen 
of a single student.  Read it and enjoy!

The English and the Russian revolutions  had  a  leader 
that stood out to have an effect on the revolution.  For the 
Russian it was Rasputin.  He was born in the  reign  of  the 
Tsar-Emperor  Alexander the Second, absolute ruler of over a 
hundred million people consisting of fifty  some  nationalities 
and speaking nearly two-hundred-different languages or 
dialects.  This empire stretched from the Prussian border to 
beyond  the  Pacific  Ocean.   Rasputin  was an Autocrat who 
ruled by himself.  He was free to appoint and dismiss ministers 
as he pleased.  Then theirs Oliver Cromwell, a man who 
stood for the commission of the unthinkable act, the  execution 
of  the  king, should have pushed the Commonwealth and 
its leaders into  further  international  isolation.   These 
were  some  of the issues that Oliver Cromwell drived for in 
the English Revolution.   Cromwell  was  dominant  political 
figure  from  1649  to  1658.  He had lead the attack on the 
king and had many followers and support.  These twoffigures, 
Rasputin  and  Oliver Cromwell, ha had great emphasis on the 
outcome of their revolutions (Russian  and  English).   Lets 
look  at some similarities and differences on how they ruled 
their reign of power. 
<P>
Cromwell was a careful figure who ruled intil his death 
in  1658.   He  lead an organization of parliament forces of 
centralized army called the new model army.  Cromwell was an 
independent  so  he  was  frightened  of parliament changing 
religion.  Cromwell had faith in his reign, he believed that 
Parliament  couldn't  win  the  civil war if they didn't try 
someting different. 
<P>
Rasputin was also a careful and powerful leader.   When 
Nicholas  went  to the front to take personal command of the 
army, his wife Alexandra took over  government  affairs  and 
relied on Rasputin almost completely.  So Rasputin also controlled 
an army and became a successful leader.  Although he 
was  killed by the people, it was because of the sake of the 
people in Russia.  They felt that he was discrediting Nicholas 
II.   Rasputin  was such a key role in ruling the army, 
Alexandra went into shock because of the death of Rasputin. 
<P>
Oliver Cromwell was born in 1599.  He immediately  took 
interest  in  public affairs.  After he had become an undergraduate 
at Cambridge, his father  fied  which  brought  him 
back  home  to  take  care of his mother and the family.  He 
also took over his fathers business which was the management 
of  land.   Later he had experienced a change of religion to 
the Puritan side.  He was respected so much  by  his  neighbours 
from  his management of land, that they choose him to 
represent  Huntington  in  the  Parliament  which  described 
itself  by  the  Petition  of Right.  Cromwell, however, was 
known to have interest in religion before politics.  He  had 
never  really  been able to hankle constitutional questions, 
and was opposite as a whole to them. 
<P>
Rasputin, however, was also a very religious  man.   He 
went to early mass at six o'clock in the morning at Afonskoe 
Podvorie.  He was so admirred, that on  the  way  back  from 
mass  there  would  be  a crowd of followers behind him, who 
accompanied him into the dining room for  breakfast.   Among 
these  guests  were  petitioners  who  arrived  around eight 
o'clock.  Rasputin was always called upon by  Tsarskoe  Selo 
at ten o'clock, even thought he was usually sleeping by this 
time.  A secret came out that Rasputin was prepared to carry 
out  various  transactions,  arrange  reals of military services, 
get sentences of imprisonment released, or dispose of 
the  granting of concessions.  While known that Rasputin was 
open for bribes, also took into consideration  the  help  of 
petitioners who came to him with nothing. 
<P>
These two leaders, and  their  different  personalities 
make  them  both uneque.  These two leaders had great effect 
on the outcome of  their  revolutions.   Even  though  their 
techneques  were  not exactly alike they had similarities in 
their personal behavior and their beliefs.  These  two  figures 
reigned  at  two different times and are also two different people 
in most respects.
