A strange thing happened to me the other day when I went to Alpha 
Beta.  As I was in the check-out line, I noticed a woman staring at 
me.  She asked me if my name was Earnest.  I said, "No, it isn't."  She 
said I looked just like her long lost son, whose name was Earnest.  I 
said that I was very sorry to hear that.  She showed me a picture of 
him and there was some resemblance.  She then asked me: Do you mind if 
I call you Earnest?  I replied: Well yes, I do.  I said to myself: 
What is this woman doing?  As she stepped out, I notice her waiting 
for me.  So when I stepped out, she mumbled something but I just 
kept going.  She started yelling: wait!  I quickly put my groceries in 
the car and as I was getting into the drivers seat, she began pulling 
on my leg, just like I'm pulling yours.
