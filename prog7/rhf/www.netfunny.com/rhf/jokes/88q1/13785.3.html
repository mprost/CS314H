<PRE>When I originally posted the flamers bible, I also posted this as the 
first response (as an example).  If you decide to post the Flamers 
Bible, you might want to post this as a response also.

In article &lt;1452@sab.ck&gt;, Sweet Polly Purebread writes: 
&gt; Dear Joe, 
<P>
I object to your use of the word "dear."  It shows you are a 
condescending, sexist pig.  Also, the submissive tone you use shows 
that you like to be tied down and flagellated with licorice whips. 
<P>
&gt; While I found your article "The Effect of Lint on Western Thought" 
&gt; to be extremely thought-provoking, 
<P>
"Thought-provoking?"  I had no idea you could think, you rotting piece 
of swamp slime. 
<P>
&gt;                             it really shouldn't have been 
&gt; posted in rec.scuba. 
<P>
What?  Are you questioning my judgement?  I'll have you know that I'm 
a member of the super-high-IQ society Menstruate.  I got an 800 on my 
PMS exam. 
<P>
Your attempts constitute nothing less than censorship.  There is a 
conspiracy against me.  You, Riff Raff, and Simon Sinister have been 
constantly harassing me by email.  This was an ad hominem attack!  I 
have therefore cross-posted this to alt.flame, rec.nude, 
comp.graphics, and rec.arts.wobegon. 
<P>
&gt; Perhaps you should have posted it in misc.misc. 
<P>
It is my right, as granted in the Bill of Rights, the Magna Carta, the 
Bible and the Quran, to post where ever I want to.  Or don't you 
believe in those documents, you damn fascist?  Perhaps if you didn't 
spend so much time sacrificing virgins and infants to Satan, you would 
have realized this. 
<P>
&gt;                                                   Your article would 
&gt; be much more appropriate there. 
<P>
Can you document this?  I will only accept documents notarized by my 
attorney, and signed by you in blood.  Besides, you don't really exist 
anyway, you AI project, you. 
<P>
&gt; Polly.
