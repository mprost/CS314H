A few years ago, the U of Utah newspaper starting printing BYU co-ed 
jokes.  They have gotten quite complex lately, but most cover the 
ideas that BYU co-eds are large, ugly, starved for dates, and looking 
for husbands [it is said that most BYU girls go there to get their 
"MRS degree" :-) ].  Examples: 
<P>
A BYUG was walking beside the road and nobody would stop for her.  She 
decided she would have better luck if she took her clothes off.  This 
turned out to be a bad idea; several minutes later a motorcycle gang 
passed on the highway.  They dragged her off into a canyon at the side 
of the road and gang-dressed her. 
<P>
Did you hear about the man who swerved to miss a BYUG in the street 
last week and didn't make it?  He ran out of gas. 
<P>
Did you hear about the new BYUG doll?  You put a ring on her finger 
and her hips expand.
