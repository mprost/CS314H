_______________________________

Test yourself:
1)  How busy have you been today?
    a&gt; Not at all busy; in fact, I just spent three hours reading USENET.
    b&gt; Somewhat busy, but I still had about three hours free for
       reading USENET.
    c&gt; Never been so busy in my life! Why, I barely had three hours to 
       spare for reading USENET!

2)  Which of the following sentences most closely resembles your day?
    a&gt; Wake up, go to ,work/school, crank up the computer/terminal and 
       read USENET, go to meetings/classes, go home, log-in, go to sleep.
    b&gt; Wake up, make a pot of coffee, crank up the computer/terminal
       and start reading USENET in the den/basement/bedroom, watch
       TV, go to sleep.
    c&gt; Read USENET, don't sleep.

3)  Which sentence best summarizes your actions when you see the
    following message on your terminal?
             ******** End of newsgroups--what next? [npq] 
    a&gt; Press "n" frantically, looking for any newsgroups you may have
       skipped over, while fighting off a plummeting sensation in the
       pit of the stomach.
    b&gt; Subscribe to more newsgroups, while fighting off the growing
       sense of emptiness in your life.
    c&gt; Crosspost your opinions on horticulture to five newsgroups and
       send a copy to rec.humor.funny, while fighting off a chilling 
       sense of unease.

Scoring:
    Score any number of points for any question circled.
&lt;0  At least you have a means for channeling your anti-social urges.
 0  Close to well-adjusted, but be careful!
&gt;0  Cheer up while considering for a moment what you would have to do
    if there was no USENET.
