As told to me by the hero of the story...

A local preacher incorporates a 5 minute childrens talk into the service
every Sunday.  The subject of one recent talk was on the differences 
between Christians and non-christians.  He talked about how apple trees
can be recognized by the apples growing on them, orange trees can be
recognized by the oranges growing on them, zebras by their stripes, leopards
by their spots, etc.  The children listened intently and quietly.  He then
postulated that Christians can be recognized by their love for their
fellow man, their love for nature, etc.  So far, so good the children seem 
to be following along.  To re-inforce the point, he led them in a verse or 
two of the song " And they'll know we are Christians by our love".  Great,
the kids knew the song, and sang along willingly.  So then we get to the
conclusion, and drawing it all together he says "So, now you see, lemon
trees make lemon, apple trees make apples and Christians make love..."
