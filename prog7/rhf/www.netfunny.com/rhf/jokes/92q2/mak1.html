<PRE>This one was told to me by budding jokemeister Mark Bell...


A renowkned sociology professor was delivering his much-awaited
lecture on sexology.  After listing the causes and treatments
of several of the more popular venereal diseases, he then
proceeded to a new topic.  "Now," he said, "as you all know,
there are exactly 193 positions in which a healthy human couple
may successfully copulate..."

But before he could complete his sentence, a shocked frenchman from
the back of the auditorium stood up and declared, "Monsieur!  I must
protest!  There are 194 positions!"

"My good man," said the professor, "there has been careful and deliberate
consideration on this topic, and the resounding conclusion is that
there are 193 positions.  Now more, no less."

"No, monsieur," the frenchman insisted, "I am a man of France.  A lover.
All lovers know that there are 194 sexual positions.  No more, no less."

"Well," said the professor, eager to get on with his lecture.  "Let's
let the class decide. I will list the 193 that I know, and if you can add
to that list, we shall know that you are right and I am wrong.  Agreed?"

"Uhhh...okay," the frenchman agreed.

"Right then," said the professor, "let's start with the boring old
missionary position..."  And the professor proceeded to describe
the missionary position.


At that point the frenchman's eyes bugged out in amazement, and
he stood immediately, waving his arms in the air.  "Mon Dieu!"
he shouted, "Make that 195!"
