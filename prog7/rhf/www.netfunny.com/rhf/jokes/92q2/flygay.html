<PRE>
Heard from a friend, who said she read about it in Herb
Caen, supposedly a true story.

An employee of USAir with the last name of Gay boarded
a USAir flight with a free travel voucher.  Soon after
he sat down, someone else came and claimed he had the
same seat assignment, so Mr. Gay moved down do an empty
seat.

Soon after that the airplane began to fill up.  The rule
with the USAir employee vouchers is that if a paying customer
needs your seat, you have to surrender it.  So when the
flight became completely full and still more needed to get
on, a flight attendant went to the original seat of Mr.
Gay and said the the man now sitting there, "Excuse me,
are you Gay?"

The man, somewhat stunned, said, "Well, yes, as a matter
of fact I am!"

The flight attendent said, "I'm sorry, but you'll have to
get off the plane."

At this point Mr. Gay, who had been watching all of this,
jumped up and said, "Excuse me, you've made a mistake --
<b>I'm</b> Gay!"

Finally, another man jumped up and said, "Well, hell, I'm
gay too!  The can't throw us all off!"
