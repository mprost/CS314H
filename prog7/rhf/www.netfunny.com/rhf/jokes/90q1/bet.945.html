When telling this story the hands should be moved as if you are talking in 
sign language. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Once upon a time there were two deaf mutes standing on a street corner talking 
to each other with sign language. 
<P>
Mute #1 (SIGN)"What would you like to do?" 
<P>
Mute #2 (SIGN)"I don't know, what about you?" 
<P>
Mute #1 (SIGN)"Let's get my car, find some girls, drive to a dark space and 
have some fun." 
<P>
Mute #2 (SIGN)"Good idea." 
<P>
So they get his car, find some girls, drive to a dark spot and are having a 
ball when the guy in the back seat taps the guy in the front seat on the 
shoulder..... 
<P>
Front Seat Mute (SIGN)"What?" 
<P>
Back Seat Mute  (SIGN)"Have you got any protection?" 
<P>
Front Seat Mute (SIGN)"No.  Don't you?" 
<P>
Back Seat Mute  (SIGN)"No.  We had better go to a drug store and get some." 
<P>
They proceed to drive to a drug store and the man in the back seat gets out 
and goes inside.  In 2 minutes he is back outside and taps on the car window. 
<P>
Inside Mute  (SIGN)"What?" 
<P>
Outside Mute (SIGN)"I've got a problem." 
<P>
Inside Mute  (SIGN)"What?" 
<P>
Outside Mute (SIGN)"I can't make the druggist understand what I want." 
<P>
Inside Mute  (SIGN)"I know what to do." 
<P>
Outside Mute (SIGN)"What?" 
<P>
Inside Mute  (SIGN)"Go back inside.  Put five dollars on the counter.  Put 
your pecker on the counter.  He'll know what you want." 
<P>
Outside Mute (SIGN)"Good idea." 
<P>
The man goes back into the drug store and 2 minutes later he's back at the car 
window. 
<P>
Inside Mute  (SIGN)"Well?" 
<P>
Outside Mute (SIGN)"It didn't work." 
<P>
Inside Mute  (SIGN)"What do you mean?" 
<P>
Outside Mute (SIGN) "I did what you told me to do.  I went inside.  I put 5 
dollars on the counter.  I put my pecker on the counter.  He put 
his on the counter.  It was bigger than mine.  He took my 5 
dollars." 
<P>
