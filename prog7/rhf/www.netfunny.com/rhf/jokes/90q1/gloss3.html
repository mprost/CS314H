<P>
<DT>beta test, v.<DD> 
To voluntarily entrust one's data, one's livelihood and one's 
sanity to hardware or software intended to destroy all 
three.  In earlier days, virgins were often selected to beta 
test volcanos. 
<P>
<DT>bit, n.<DD> 
A unit of measure applied to color.  Twenty-four-bit color 
refers to expensive $3 color as opposed to the cheaper 25 
cent, or two-bit, color that use to be available a few years 
ago. 
<P>
<DT>buzzword, n.<DD> 
The fly in the ointment of computer literacy. 
<P>
<DT>clone, n.<DD> 
1. An exact duplicate, as in "our product is a clone of their 
product." 2. A shoddy, spurious copy, as in "their product is 
a clone of our product." 
<P>
<DT>enhance, v.<DD> 
To tamper with an image, usually to its detriment. 
<P>
<DT>genlock, n.<DD> 
Why he stays in the bottle. 
<P>
<DT>guru, n.<DD> 
A computer owner who can read the manual. 
<P>
<DT>handshaking protocol, n.<DD> 
A process employed by hostile hardware devices to initiate a 
terse but civil dialogue, which, in turn, is characterized by 
occasional misunderstanding, sulking, and name-calling. 
<P>
<DT>italic, adj.<DD> 
Slanted to the right to emphasize key phrases. Unique to 
Western alphabets; in Eastern languages, the same phrases are 
often slanted to the left. 
<P>
<DT>Japan, n.<DD> 
A fictional place where elves, gnomes and economic 
imperialists create electronic equipment and computers using 
black magic.  It is said that in the capital city of 
Akihabara, the streets are paved with gold and semiconductor 
chips grow on low bushes from which they are harvested by the 
happy natives. 
<P>
<DT>kern, v.<DD> 
1. To pack type together as tightly as the kernels on an ear 
of corn.  2. In parts of Brooklyn and Queens, N.Y., a small, 
metal object used as part of the monetary system. 
<P>
<DT>modem, adj.<DD> 
Up-to-date, new-fangled, as in "Thoroughly Modem Millie."  An 
unfortunate byproduct of kerning. 
<P>
<DT>pixel, n.<DD> 
A mischievous, magical spirit associated with screen 
displays.  The computer industry has frequently borrowed from 
mythology: Witness the sprites in computer graphics, the 
demons in artificial intelligence, and the trolls in the 
marketing department. 
<P>
<DT>prototype, n.<DD> 
First stage in the life cycle of a computer product, followed 
by pre-alpha, alpha, beta, release version, corrected release 
version, upgrade, corrected upgrade, etc.  Unlike its 
successors, the prototype is not expected to work. 
<P>
<DT>revolutionary, adj.<DD> 
Repackaged. 
<P>
<DT>Unix, N.<DD> 
A computer operating system, once thought to be flabby and 
impotent, that now shows a surprising interest in making off 
with the workstation harem.
