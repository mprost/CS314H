Excerpted from "Quotes, damned quotes and..." by John Bibby. 
<P>
Mathematicians are like Frenchmen: whatever you say to them they 
translate into their own language and forthwith it is something 
entirely different. (Goethe) 
<P>
If there is a 50-50 chance that something can go wrong, then 9 
times out of ten it will. (Paul Harvey News, 1979) 
<P>
"Give us a copper Guv," said the beggar to the Treasury 
statistician when he waylaid him in Parliament square. "I 
haven't eaten for three days." "Ah," said the statistician, "And 
how does that compare with the same period last year?" (Russell 
Lewis) 
<P>
"I gather, young man, that you wish to be a Member of 
Parliament. The first lesson that you must learn is, when I call 
for statistics about the rate of infant mortality, what I want 
is proof that fewer babies died when I was Prime Minister than 
when anyone else was Prime Minister. That is a political 
statistic." (Winston Churchill) 
<P>
"You haven't told me yet," said Lady Nuttal, "what it is your 
fiance does for a living?" 
<P>
"He's a statistician," replied Lamia, with an annoying sense of 
being on the defensive. 
<P>
Lady Nuttal was obviously taken aback. It had not occurred to 
her that statisticians entered into normal social relationships. 
The species, she would have surmised, was perpetuated in some 
collateral manner, like mules. 
<P>
"But Aunt Sara, it's a very interesting profession," said Lamia 
warmly. 
<P>
"I don't doubt it," said her aunt, who obviously doubted it very 
much. "To express anything important in mere figures is so 
plainly impossible that there must be endless scope for 
well-paid advice on how to do it. But don't you think that 
life with a statistician would be rather, shall we say, 
humdrum?" 
<P>
Lamia was silent. She felt reluctant to discuss the surprising 
depth of emotional possibility which she had discovered below 
Edward's numerical veneer. 
<P>
"It's not the figures themselves," she said finally. "it's what 
you do with them that matters." (K.A.C. Manderville, The undoing 
of Lamia Gurdleneck)
