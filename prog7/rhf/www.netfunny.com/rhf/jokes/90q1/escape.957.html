(best done with exaggerated English &amp; German accents) 
<P>
An English P.O.W. is in a German hospital with serious injuries.  The 
doctor comes into his room and says, "The news iss bad.  Ve are going to 
have to amputate your leg."  The Brit replies "Right then.  War is hell and 
all that malarkey.  But could you ask your commandant if he wouldn't find 
it to much of a bother to drop it over my beloved homeland when he goes on 
his next bombing mission?"  Off goes the doctor, and with the commandant's 
permission, they fulfill his request. 
<P>
A few days later, the doctor returns into his room and says, "More bad news. 
Ve are going to have to amputate your other leg."  The Brit replies "Right 
then.  War is hell and all that malarkey.  Could you ask your commandant 
if he wouldn't mind terribly if he could drop it over my beloved homeland 
when he goes on his next bombing mission?"  Off goes the doctor, and again 
his request is fulfilled. 
<P>
Another week passes, and the doctor returns to his room and says, "Achh! More 
bad news.  Ve are going to have to amputate your arm."  The Brit replies 
"Right then.  War is hell and all that malarkey.  Please do ask your 
commandant if he could find the time to drop it over my beloved homeland on 
his next bombing mission?"  Sure enough, it is done. 
<P>
More time passes, and the doctor once again returns and says, "Ze news, 
she does not get any better.  Ve are going to have to amputate your other 
arm!" The Brit replies "Right then.  War is hell and all that malarkey. 
It would warm my heart dearly if the commandant could drop it over my 
beloved homeland on his next bombing mission." The doctor goes off 
and returns with an agitated look on his face. "The commandant says NO, 
he vill not do ziss for you.  He thinks you are trying to escape!"
