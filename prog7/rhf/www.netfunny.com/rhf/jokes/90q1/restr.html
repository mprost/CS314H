-From: Personnel Department						Date: January 1, 1990 
<P>
-To: ALL PERSONNEL						Subject: Restroom Trip 
<P>
Policy 
<P>
In the past, employees were permitted to make trips to the restroom 
under informal guidelines.  Effective February 1, 1990, a RESTROOM TRIP 
POLICY (RTP) will be established to provide a consistent method of 
accounting for each employees restroom time and ensuring equal treatment 
of all employees. 
<P>
Under this policy, a "Restroom Trip Bank" will be established for each 
employee.  The first day of each month, employees will be given a 
Restroom Trip Credit of 20.  Restroom Trip Credits can be accumulated 
from month to month, to a maximum of 100 credits at which point no 
further credits can be accumulated. 
<P>
Currently, the entrances to all restrooms are being equipped with 
personnel identification stations and computer-linked voice print 
recognition.  During the next two weeks, each employee must provide two 
copies of their voice print (one normal, one under stress) to Personnel. 
The voice print recognition stations will be operational, but not 
restrictive, for the month of January; employees should acquaint 
themselves with the stations during that period.  If an employee's 
Restroom Trip Bank balance reaches zero, the doors to all restrooms will 
remain locked for that employee's voice until the first of the next 
month. 
<P>
In addition, all restroom stalls are being equipped with timed paper 
roll retractors.  If the stall is occupied for more than three minutes, 
an alarm will sound, the roll of paper in the stall will retract, the toilet 
will flush, and the stall door will open. 
<P>
If you have any questions about the new policy, please ask your 
supervisor. 
<P>
