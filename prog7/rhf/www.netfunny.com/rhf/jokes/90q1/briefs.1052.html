I wrote these for our campus humor paper before Christmas break.  Some are 
UCSD specific, like our new rule banning "fighting words."  Some were written 
before Romania revolted.  And some might be offensive.  Bearing that in 
mind... 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The first arrest under the new "fighting words" policy was made. A 
reggae group performing in the Price Center was arrested after singing a song 
calling for the end to apartheid in South Africa and whipping up student 
fervor. A spokesperson for the police said that the Regents could not tolerate 
anyone claiming the world wasn't as kind and gentle as President Bush had 
officially declared it was. 
<P>
The federal government completed the phasing out of lobbying in Congress, 
calling it a serious breach of democracy and not in the best interests of the 
nation.  It will be replaced by a series of public auctions where both 
senators' and representatives' votes will be sold to the highest bidder. 
Already, most big businesses and many organized religions have applied for 
bidding privileges, gearing up to purchase votes for the bill that is now 
before Congress: whether to indict Senator Alan Cranston for ethics 
violations. 
<P>
The FBI, using its new authority to arrest criminals around the world 
without the host country's consent, descended on Mexico last week. They 
arrested a Mexican national for possession of one joint, and under the America 
"zero tolerance" law, confiscated the entire country. President Salinas lashed 
out at the FBI's action, calling it an unjustifiable breach of international 
law, but an FBI spokesman told Salinas to shut up and finish scrubbing out the 
lavatory. 
<P>
President Bush harshly denounced the Communist governments still holding 
out against reform. He criticized their violent suppression of political 
demonstrations and food riots, saying that police force should not be used to 
solve social problems. He stressed the importance of helping people to reform, 
rather than sentencing them to unprofitable incarceration. He then excused 
himself to attend a "War On Drugs" rally. 
<P>
More news later from Koala News, UCSD's news leaders.
