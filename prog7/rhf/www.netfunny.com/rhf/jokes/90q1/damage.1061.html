Hidden Brain Damage Scale

Of the many psychometric devices designed to measure the dimensions of human
variation, the Hidden Brain Damage Scale stands alone as the only instrument
capable of predicting a preference for pimento loaf.  For this reason, and
despite the sizable revenues that might accrue from the copyright, we offer the
scale here for public consumption.  It was authored in a flurry of graduate
school insight some years ago by Robin Vallacher (Illinois Institute of Technology),
Christopher Gilbert (private practice, New Jersey) and Daniel Wegner
(Trinity University, San Antonio, Texas).  Although a true-false format is
recommended, we have found that many test-takers opt for the response of
getting tangled up in the drapery.
