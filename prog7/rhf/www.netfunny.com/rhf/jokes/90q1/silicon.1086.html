The DO-IT-YOURSELF Intel 80387 KIT !!!!!!!!<BR>
<P>
(Now with Microwave Instructions)<BR>
<P>
Copyrighted 1989 by Paul Carroll<BR>
</center>
<P>
Congratulations on purchasing this fine kit from the CARROLL 
LIMITED COMPANY(1).  This 80387 chip is designed(2) to give years of 
pleasure.  This kit contains the purest silicon from Silicon 
Valley(3) to help you build the fastest and bestest floating 
point processor possible.  Just follow the following easy 
instructions: 
<P>
1.  Preheat oven to 1600 degrees Centigrade (that's 3000 degrees 
Fahrenheit for those of you who dropped out of 
chemistry).  Wait 5 minutes. 
<P>
2.  Put packet of PURE SILICON in ceramic crucible or, if one 
is not handy, in your wife's favorite sauce pan. 
<P>
3.  Place crucible or pan in oven on middle tray.  Bake well 
for 30 minutes or until the PURE SILICON has the 
consistency of hot chocolate.  WARNING:  It is NOT 
hot chocolate and is not intended for internal 
consumption. 
<P>
4.  Pour PURE SILICON mixture into patented(4) wafer mold. 
Spread mixture evenly, removing any lumps.  Wait 2 
hours for wafer to harden. 
<P>
5.  Sand surface of wafer until it is smooth to the touch. 
Number 5 grit is recommended. 
<P>
6.  Divide wafer into a series of rectangles, each of which is 
3.5 centimeters by 1.2 centimeters.  Accuracy counts, 
so make those lines straight! 
<P>
7.  Etch the easy-to-follow schematics for the Intel 80387 
chip onto the wafer in each rectangle.  Each rectangle 
has the potential to be an 80387 processor, so be 
sure to make more than one in case problems develop. 
Remember, the smaller the pattern, the faster the chip, 
so don't be afraid to go for real detail.  A magnifying 
glass may be useful. 
<P>
8.  Cut rectangles from the wafer, making sure that you follow 
the lines.  Scissors may be used, although razor blades 
are also useful(5).  Safety scissors are recommended for 
software engineers if this is their first hardware 
project. 
<P>
9.  Place rectangle in handy plastic pin-out package(6). 
Be sure to get the rectangle positioned in the middle 
of the package.  Wire pins to indicated areas on 
the 80387 schematics.  You may replace the supplied 
18-gauge wire with  a finer wire if you so desire. 
<P>
10.  Glue package top onto package bottom, making sure that 
the top fits firmly.  Take your time.  Remember, 
neatness counts!  Now is not the time to make an 
unsightly error.  Wait for glue to dry (24 hours 
is recommended unless super glue is used(7)). 
<P>
<CENTER>THAT'S IT!!!</CENTER><BR>
<P>
You are now the proud owner of an Intel 80387 processor(8)!!! 
No one will be able to tell the difference between it and 
an actual chip(9)!!!  Plug this chip into your PC and away 
you go! 
<P>
Be sure to look for the :

Do-It-YOURSELF Intel 80386SX / AMD 80286 kit<BR>
soon to be in stores near you!<BR>

<HR>
<P>
<CENTER>Microwave Instructions</CENTER><BR>
<P>
1.  Place PURE SILICON packet in microwave oven.  Set 
heat setting to ultra-ultra-high.  Set time limit 
for 3 minutes. 
<P>
2.  Place microwave oven in conventional oven on lower 
tray.  Set oven temperature to 1600 degrees 
Centigrade.  Continue with normal instructions 
at step 3. 
<P>
Notes: 
<P>
1) Only on weekends or between 6pm to 9pm. 
<P>
2) Not by us, of course. 
<P>
3) Okay, so it isn't from Silicon Valley, but it is from 
California(10). 
<P>
4) By someone, I'm sure. 
<P>
5) Especially when things go really wrong. 
<P>
6) What, you don't have a handy plastic pin-out package? 
Shame on you! 
<P>
7) In which case, the package is probably glued to your fingers. 
That's okay, it should make digital calculations 
run faster. 
<P>
8) Or at least a close facsimile. 
<P>
9) Unless they look, of course. 
<P>
10) Okay, so it isn't from California, but it is DIRT.
