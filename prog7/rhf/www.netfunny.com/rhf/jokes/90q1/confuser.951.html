<P>
<CENTER>"All the news that fits, we print." -  A. E. Newman</CENTER><BR>
<P>
DIGITAL SELLS ITS EMPLOYEES - Digital Equipment Corporation announced 
today that since it has had so much trouble selling its VAXes and has 
so many excess employees, it will begin offering the employees for 
sale.  According to our reporter, DEC expects its employees to run about 
20% faster than its older machines and about half the speed of its RISC 
based DECSTATION line.  Prices and delivery are expected at the NODECEMP 
show in January. 
<P>
HP/APOLLO MERGER FOLLOWUP - It has come to the attention of this paper 
that analysts have finally concluded what HP and Apollo each brought to 
their recent merger.  HP brought Tauruses and Apollo gave HP yet another 
line of incompatible machines and lots of third party peripherals to 
compete with HP's own.  Most analysts are convinced HP should have bought 
Apollo years ago when HP could have also brought donuts. 
<P>
COMPAQ announced last week that it has the world's most expensive PC 
line at prices up to $80,000.  Compaq also announced sales of 2000 to its 
PC competitor Hewlett Packard.  HP spokesperson Fasta Cieuw said that the 
new machines will allow HP management to do even larger and more 
complicated Lotus spreadsheets.  HP had previously announced the 
replacement of its world renowned MBWA with MBLS. 
<P>
Sun Microsystems recently pronounced that X-Windows is not an industry 
standard.  A SUN spokeswoman claimed that it couldn't possibly be a 
standard as SUN has not invented it yet.  "As soon as we come up with it, 
it will be made a standard," she said.  "We expect to have a working 
X-Windows before the turn of the century and we promise to be first to 
market as we always are." 
<P>
DEC INTRODUCES ITS FIRST MAINFRAME. - Digital Equipment Corporation 
announced its first mainframe size computer.  "We tried to make it bigger 
than IBM's but we did not have enough sheet metal in the plant" a DEC 
spokesman said.  "However, it does outrun the DECStation 3100 by 20% and 
is at least twice as fast as the employees we will be selling in the 
next year."  The spokesman was referring to the previous announcement 
about selling its employees. 
<P>
HP ANNOUNCES RETURN TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS - Because of recent criticism 
from employees about how the "HP WAY" was going away, HP recently 
announced some major plans to reverse the trend.  "The first of these is 
the recent removal of backup from our HP-UX SAM subsystem.  We wanted to 
go back to the old way of making a decision without any field or 
customer input just like we used to do," a spokesperson from HP 
announced.  The spokesperson also stated that there was no truth to the 
rumor that HP was intending to bring back donuts by merging with "Debbie 
Does Donuts."  "That kind of business is incompatible with the image we 
want to project," said the spokesperson. 
<P>
IBM ANNOUNCES NEW WORKSTATION LINE - In a surprise move, IBM announced a 
fast way to bring in a new, powerful line of workstations totally 
compatible with its current mainframe line.  In an amazing feat of 
technical brilliance, IBM claimed 100% compatibility between mainframe 
and workstation.  IBM spokesman Joe Isuzu said the new 3090SRX is at 
least as fast as the Apollo DN10000 "and a lot bigger and more expensive." 
Mr. Isuzu denied that the 3090SRX is just a 3090 with all terminals 
removed except the console.  "Would we do something like that" he asked? 
Prices for the new workstations are in the $1M to $10M range.  Delivery 
is expected to start by 1993. 
<P>
HP CRITICIZES CUSTOMERS - In a surprise move, HP sharply criticized some 
of its customers for having centralized administrative machines and 
failing to put workstations on the desks of their field engineers.  "Who 
do they think they are?" a spokeswoman said.  "Only we are allowed to be 
so backward because we make them." 
<P>
SUN DOUBLES MTBF - SUN Microsystems claimed the MTBF leadership position 
in quality.  "In the tradition of leading the industry, we at SUN are 
proud to claim the best quality increase.  Once again, we lead not only 
in price/performance and support, but now we are the quality champion" 
said the new SUN Vice-President Jane Doe.  "We increased our MTBF from 
100 hours to 300 hours, a 300% increase.  HP can't do that.  The best they 
can do is 10.1 years to 10.2 years, a measly increase of less than 1%. 
That means we are more than 300 times better than HP! That's leadership." 
This reporter asked HP to respond but we were unable to find anyone in 
public relations or marketing.  In related news, this reporter found out 
that the name "Jane Doe" is not the real name for the SUN Vice-President 
we had talked to.  However, she said it was more convenient to use that 
name as it saved the company considerable money in not having to reprint 
business cards every time an executive left.
