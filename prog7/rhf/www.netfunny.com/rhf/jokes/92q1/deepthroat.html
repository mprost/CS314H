<PRE>As a follow-up to my previous joke:

An (unnamed) friend of mine told me about an incident that occured to
her when she was a freshmen here an Waterloo. Having never had a
boyfriend before and coming from a small and mostly conservative 
town, she was not well-versed with sexual terminology when she entered
university. 

In her first year, she lived in a residence where there were multiple
"common rooms" that contained a kitchenette and TV, etc. One day, she
was wandering around looking for people to talk to when she discovered
a floor-mate Christine (a pseudonym) engaged in some very passionate
and wet french-kissing with her boyfriend. My friend continued her
quest, embarrassed about intruding on their "privacy." She went into
the other common room.  Sitting there were two guys who lived on that
floor, vegetating in front of the TV.

One of them said, "Hey, Georgina (a pseudonym), have you seen Christine
around?"

Georgina thought back a bit and mustered all the savvy she could to
reply, "Yeah, she's in the other common room, deep-throating with her
boyfriend."

The two guys were up and gone within the second.

Seconds later, they returned laughing heartily. One of them asked,
"Georgie, do you know what deep-throating is?" amidst his tears. 
To this day, they have never let her live that one down!
