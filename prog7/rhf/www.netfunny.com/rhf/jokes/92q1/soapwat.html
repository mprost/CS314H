Here's a joke I heard from somewhere:

	A priest was asked to dinner by one of his parishoners who he knew
as being an unkempt housekeeper.  When he sat down at the table, he noticed
that the dishes were the dirtiest that he had ever seen in his life.
	"Were these dishes ever washed?" he asked his hostess, running his 
fingers over the grit and grime.  She replied, "They're as clean as soap
and water could get them".  He felt a bit apprehensive but blessed the food
anyway and started eating.  It was really delicious and he said so, despite
the dirty dishes.
	When dinner was over, the hostess took the dishes outside and barked
"Here Soap!  Here Water!"
