		The Differences Between Intel Chips
			By Dave Smith 

For those who are confused by the various processor offering by Intel,
here's a quick guide to clear you up.

8086:	A spacious closet.  Has four walls and plenty of shelf space.
	It's a lot better than keeping your stuff in stacked cardboard
	boxes like you had to with the 8080

8088:	A spacious clost like the 8086, but lacks the mirrored doors
	and instead uses a narrower door made of standard plywood.
	Not as pretty, but a less expensive.

80186:	Still a closet with the mirrored doors, but now includes a 
	new railing to hang your clothes and this one is bolted on,
	not that wooden thing that always falls when you bump it off.
	Also the doors run on a better track.  Not the greatest, but
	the builder was a little slow.

80286:	A closet as with the 8086, but includes a small trap door
	on the ceiling that you can climb up with great effort to 
	reach a larger attic to store stuff in.  The door is sufficiently
	small that you can only shove small things in or out of it.

80386:	A 1930s victorian house somewhat rundown, but acceptable.
	Has a closet, but also has a large garage.  You can be
	in the garage or the closet, but you can't have a closet
	or a workbench in the garage.  An option in building allows
	you to build out the house into several small closet size
	apartments.  Each occupant of an apartment is unaware they
	have any neighbors.  (Unless they give a note to you to post
	on the board in front hall for other neighbors to see.)

80386SX: Another 1930s house, but this one doesn't have the double
	doors in the entry.

80486:	A small condo with closets.

80486SX: The same condo, but with strong owners association.  You can buy
	the condo for less money, but you can't get the keys unless you
	buy them from owners association for a large fee.
