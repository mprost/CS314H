<PRE>The great circus performer Mephisto decided to make a few extra
bucks on the side by taking bets and by challenging his audience
to equal his performances.

This policy continued on quite successfully until he brought his
elephant into the act.  He would drag the elephant out onto the
stage, then dare anyone in the audience to make the elephant do
some trick, offering them financial compensation if they succeeded.

One day, he brought out the elephant as usual, and told the crowd:
"You've all seen an elephant stand on three feet?"  The crowd
nodded.  "You've all seen an elephant stand on two feet?"  The crowd
nodded.  "You've all seen an elephant stand on one foot?"  The crowd
nodded again.  "I will pay $10 000 to any one who can make this elephant
jump into the air with all four feet off the ground!"

No one took the challenge until a thin old man walked boldly from the
back.  He looked the elephant steely in the eye, the proceeded to
walk around to its hindquarters.  Producng a brick in either hand,
he then proceeded to smash the elephant's testicles between the
bricks. 

The elephant roared in pain and jumped eight feet into the air.
Mephisto paid the man reluctantly, then moved his show to another
town.

A few years later Mephisto was short on cash again, and was not
attracting as much business as he used to.  So he brought back his
old act of challenging the crowd with financial recompense.  In this
way, greater crowds gathered, and his show was a bigger success.

He would drag out the elephant and say: "You've all seen an elephant
nod up and down, right?"  The crowd nodded.  "But none of you have
ever seen an elephant shake its head from side to side!  I will
pay anyone $10 000 who can make my elephant do such a trick!"

No one took up the challenge until the same thin old man tromped
boldly down from the back.  He looked the elephant coldly in the
eye and said, "Do you remember me?"

The elephant nodded up and down.

"Do you want me to do it again?"

The elephant shook its head vigorously from side to side.  Mephisto
paid the man and retired.
