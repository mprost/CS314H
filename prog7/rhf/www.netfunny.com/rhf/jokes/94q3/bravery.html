[I heard this from a friend, Sandro Fouche.  Don't know
where he got it from]

One day, a general of the army, an admiral, and an air
force general are having an argument about whose branch
of the military is braver.
So the admiral yells to a passing sailor, "Sailor, catch
that falling anchor!"
The sailor snaps to attention, shouts, "Yes, sir!", runs
under the anchor, and is crushed to death trying to catch it.
The admiral turns to the others and says "Gentlemen, that
was bravery."
The army general says, "That's nothing," and yells, "Private,
stop that moving tank!"
The private snaps to attention, shouts "Yes, sir!" and is
crushed under the tank while trying to stop it.
The army general turns back to the others and says,
"Gentlemen, that took guts."
Finally, the air force general takes his turn.  "Airman,
catch that landing plane."
The airman snaps to attention and shouts "F*ck you, sir."
The air force general turns to the others and says,
"Gentlemen, _that_ took balls."
