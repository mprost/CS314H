<PRE>I posted this in rec.boats yesterday; someone suggested that I submit 
it to you.  I'm not sure it's that funny but it breaks my wife up every
time we mention it. :-)

&gt;Let's see... where can you buy a marine...
&gt;
&gt;Try the Navy. I hear whenever they catch one they sell'em to the locals.

Reminds me of my neighbor, a wonderful woman who thought the world of
her late father.  This was about thirty years ago-- her father loved 
to listen to march music-- that's right-- marches, as in John Phillip
Sousa.  After much effort to find the right gift for his birthday, she
hit paydirt.  A modern (transistor!) radio that had not only AM and
FM, but also (ta da...) the *Marine Band*.

She was absolutely heartbroken, when informed after presenting this 
gift to her father, that the Marine Band no longer played on the radio.
The store manager was non-plussed at the tongue-lashing she gave him
for false advertising when she returned the "obsolete" equipment.
