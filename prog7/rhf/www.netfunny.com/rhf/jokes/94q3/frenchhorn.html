<PRE>There once was a woman who had gone a long time without so much as the
hope of having a relationship.  When she finally picked up a handsome
looking guy and went out with him, her friends were naturally curious as
to how it went.

"What's he like?" said the woman's friend the day after the big event.

"Oh, he's fine, I guess.  He's a musician, you know," said she.

"Did he have class?" said the friend.

The friend's ears perked up as the woman said:  "Well, most of the time, yes,
but I don't think I'll be going out with him again."

"Oh?  Why not?" asked the friend.

"Well, he plays the french horn, so I guess it's just habit, but every
time we kiss, he sticks his fist in my rear!"
