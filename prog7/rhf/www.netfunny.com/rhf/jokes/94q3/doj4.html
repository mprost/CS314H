As the preliminary hearing slowly plays out, it looks like this story,
and the jokes, will be with us for awhile.

Pass the Slice.

Why did OJ stay in the bronco at his estate before surrendering to the
  police?

A: He was waiting for assurance that none of the officers who arrested
  Rodney King were there.

If an ex-football player had to kill his wife, why couldn't it have
been Frank Gifford?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
From: markman@paradox.psych.columbia.edu (Art Markman)
Subject: D'oh!

The murderer left one bloody glove at the crime scene, and brought
one to his home.  He drove a white Bronco home and left it on a public
road in front of his home with blood stains on it and a trail of blood
leading to the house.  Heck, the guy even called for a limo and then was
out committing the crime while the limo driver was waiting at the front
door ringing the bell.

The prosecution was right to narrow the list of suspects down to 
Simpsons, but the way this one was carried out, they may have gotten
the wrong one!

From: DSROGER@saix367.sandia.gov (Rogers, Scott)
Keywords: topical, chuckle

OJ calls a limo service and requests a limo. The dispatcher tells Mr. Simpson 
"Yes sir Mr. Simpson we have a limo for you, but it will be a 45 minute wait." 
OJ replies, "Great, I have some time to kill."

This one is orignal and came to me while watching the OJ debacle at
my favorite watering hole Friday night:

Q: What's worse than being married to John Bobbit?
A: Being divorced from OJ Simpson.

Subject: Nicole Simpson's new career
From: pd411x@unix1.circ.gwu.edu (P.J. Geraghty)
Keywords: topical, smirk, offensive

(news flash:  Nicole Simpson, wife of OJ Simpson, is found with her throat
slashed.)

Have you heard about OJ's wife's new job?

She's a Pez dispenser.
