<P>
These are stories and test questions accumulated by music teachers in the 
state of Missouri. 
<P>
<H4>Music Education</H4>
<P>
Agnus Dei was a woman composer famous for her church music. 
<P>
Refrain means don't do it.  A refrain in music is the part you better 
not try to sing. 
<P>
A virtuoso is a musician with real high morals. 
<P>
John Sebastian Bach died from 1750 to the present. 
<P>
Handel was half German, half Italian, and half English.  He was rather large. 
<P>
Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf.  He was so deaf he wrote 
loud music.  He took long walks in the forest even when everyone was 
calling him.  I guess he could not hear so good.  Beethoven expired in 
1827 and later died from this. 
<P>
Henry Purcell is a well known composer few people have ever heard of. 
<P>
Aaron Copland is one of your most famous contemporary composers.  It is 
unusual to be contemporary.  Most composers do not live until they are 
dead. 
<P>
An opera is a song of bigly size. 
<P>
In the last scene of Pagliacci, Canio stabs Nedda who is the one he 
really loves.  Pretty soon Silvio also gets stabbed, and they all live 
happily ever after. 
<P>
When a singer sings, he stirs up the air and makes it hit any passing 
eardrums.  But if he is good, he knows how to keep it from hurting. 
<P>
Music sung by two people at the same time is called a duel. 
<P>
I know what a sextet is but I had rather not say. 
<P>
Caruso was at first an Italian.  Then someone heard his voice and said 
he would go a long way.  And so he came to America. 
<P>
A good orchestra is always ready to play if the conductor steps on 
the odium. 
<P>
Morris dancing is a country survival from times when people were happy. 
<P>
Most authorities agree that music of antiquity was written long ago. 
<P>
Probably the most marvelous fugue was the one between the Hatfields 
and McCoys. 
<P>
My very best liked piece of music is the Bronze Lullaby. 
<P>
My favorite composer is Opus. 
<P>
A harp is a nude piano. 
<P>
A tuba is much larger than its name. 
<P>
Instruments come in many sizes, shapes and orchestras. 
<P>
You should always say celli when you mean there are two or more cellos. 
<P>
Another name for kettle drums is timpani.  But I think I will just stick 
with the first name and learn it good. 
<P>
A trumpet is an instrument when it is not an elephant sound. 
<P>
While trombones have tubes, trumpets prefer to wear valves. 
<P>
The double bass is also called the bass viol, string bass, and bass 
fiddle.  It has so many names because it is so huge. 
<P>
When electric currents go through them, guitars start making sounds. 
So would anybody. 
<P>
Question:  What are kettle drums called?  Answer:  Kettle drums. 
<P>
Cymbals are round, metal CLANGS! 
<P>
A bassoon looks like nothing I have ever heard. 
<P>
Last month I found out how a clarinet works by taking it apart.  I both 
found out and got in trouble. 
<P>
Question:  Is the saxophone a brass or a woodwind instrument? 
Answer:  Yes. 
<P>
The concertmaster of an orchestra is always the person who sits in the 
first chair of the first violins.  This means that when a person is 
elected concertmaster, he has to hurry up and learn how to play a violin 
real good. 
<P>
For some reason, they always put a treble clef in front of every line 
of flute music.  You just watch. 
<P>
I can't reach the brakes on this piano! 
<P>
The main trouble with a French horn is it's too tangled up. 
<P>
Anyone who can read all the instrument notes at the same time gets to be 
the conductor. 
<P>
Instrumentalist is a many-purposed word for many player-types. 
<P>
The flute is a skinny-high shape-sounded instrument. 
<P>
The most dangerous part about playing cymbals is near the nose. 
<P>
A contra-bassoon is like a bassoon, only more so. 
<P>
Tubas are a bit too much. 
<P>
Music instrument has a plural known as orchestra. 
<P>
I would like for you to teach me to play the cello.  Would tomorrow 
or Friday be best? 
<P>
My favorite instrument is the bassoon.  It is so hard to play people seldom 
play it.  That is why I like the bassoon best. 
<P>
It is easy to teach anyone to play the maracas.  Just grip the neck and 
shake him in rhythm. 
<P>
Just about any animal skin can be stretched over a frame to make a pleasant 
sound once the animal is removed. 
<P>
