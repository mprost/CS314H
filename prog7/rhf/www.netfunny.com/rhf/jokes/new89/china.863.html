by George F. Will).

Deng Xiaoping tells Gorbachev that three demands must be met before 
relations can improve.  First, China wants 100 million tons of coal. 
"Agreed," says Gorbachev.  And 20 new ships.  "Done," says Gorbachev. 
And a million bicycles.  "Impossible," says Gorbachev.  "But why?" 
asks Deng.  "Because," says Gorbachev, "the Poles don't make bicycles."

Khrushchev says to Zhou Enlai, "The difference between the Soviet 
Union and China is that I rose to power from the peasant class, 
whereas you came from the privileged Mandarin class."  Zhou replies, 
"True.  But there is this similarity.  Each of us is a traitor to his 
class."
