This British explorer is in the dark jungles of Africa, going where no 
*man* has gone before. Accompanying him is his trusted guide, interpreter, 
cook, and troubleshooter in one. 
<P>
One day early in the morning, they arrive at a lake and find a handsome 
dark young man engaged in "playful activities" with 8-9 beautiful, dark, 
young women, all in nude. The young man had the biggest, strongest penis the 
Britisher had ever seen, or even imagined. He was simply awed. He asked his 
guide who this man was. 
<P>
"He is the prince of the tribe that lives on the other side of the lake, 
Sir," came the reply, "This is his morning ritual." 
<P>
"Ask him," the awed Brit said to his companion, "how did his penis get to 
be this size?" 
<P>
The guide goes to the lake and talks to the man, who seems to get very 
agitated by the conversation. 
<P>
"Well, what did he say?" asked our hero to his assistant on his return. 
<P>
"He said, 'There's nothing wrong with my penis. Doesn't the white man's 
shrink in cold water?'" 
<P>
