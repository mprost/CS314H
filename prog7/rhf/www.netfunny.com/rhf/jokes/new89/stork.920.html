Ovulation versus cretinism 
<P>
Two different theories exist concerning the origin of children: the theory of 
sexual reproduction, and the theory of the stork. Many people believe in the 
theory of sexual reproduction because they have been taught this theory 
at school. 
<P>
In reality, however, many of the world's leading scientists are in favour of 
the theory of the stork. If the theory of sexual reproduction 
is taught in schools, 
it must only be taught as a theory and not as the truth. Alternative 
theories, such as the theory of the stork, must also be taught. 
<P>
Evidence supporting the theory of the stork includes the following: 
<P>
1. 
It is a scientifically established fact that the stork does exist. 
This can be confirmed by every ornithologist. 
<P>
2. 
The alleged human foetal development contains several features 
that the theory of sexual reproduction is unable to explain. 
<P>
3. 
The theory of sexual reproduction implies that a child is approximately 
nine months old at birth. This is an absurd claim. Everyone knows that a 
newborn child is newborn. 
<P>
4. 
According to the theory of sexual reproduction, children are a result of 
sexual intercourse. There are, however, several well documented cases where 
sexual intercourse has not led to the birth of a child. 
<P>
5. 
Statistical studies in the Netherlands have indicated a positive correlation 
between the birth rate and the number of storks. Both are decreasing. 
<P>
6. 
The theory of the stork can be investigated by rigorous scientific methods. 
The only assumption involved is that children are delivered by the stork.
