</PRE>One day in the Garden of Eden, Eve calls out to God, "Lord, I have a 
problem!" 
<P>
"What's the problem, Eve?" 
<P>
"Lord, I know you've created me and have provided this beautiful garden 
and all of these wonderful animals, and that hilarious comedy snake, but 
I'm just not happy." 
<P>
"Why is that, Eve?" came the reply from above. 
<P>
"Lord, I am lonely. And I'm sick to death of apples." 
<P>
"Well, Eve, in that case, I have a solution. I shall create a man for 
you." 
<P>
"What's a 'man', Lord?" 
<P>
"This man will be a flawed creature, with aggressive tendencies, an 
enormous ego and an inability to empathize or listen to you properly. 
All in all, he'll give you a hard time. But, he'll be bigger and faster 
and more muscular than you. He'll be really good at fighting and kicking 
a ball about and hunting fleet-footed ruminants, and not altogether bad 
in the sack." 
<P>
"Sounds great," says Eve, with an ironically raised eyebrow. 
<P>
"Yeah, well. He's better than a poke in the eye with a burnt stick. But, 
you can have him on one condition." 
<P>
"What's that, Lord?" 
<P>
"You'll have to let him believe that I made him first." 
<P>
