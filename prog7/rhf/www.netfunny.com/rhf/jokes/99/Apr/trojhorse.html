<BR>-----Original Message-----<BR>
&gt;TO: Trojan Army Listserv &lt; Trojans-L@troy.org<BR>
&gt;RE: WARNING!! BEWARE GREEKS BEARING GIFTS!<BR>
<P>
Hey Hector,<BR>
<P>
This was forwarded to me by Cassandra--it looks legit. Please distribute<BR>
to Priam, Hecuba, and your 99 siblings.<BR>
<P>
Thanks,<BR>
<P>
Laocoon<BR>
<P>
&gt;WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;IF YOU RECEIVE A GIFT IN THE SHAPE OF A LARGE WOODEN HORSE DO NOT<BR>
&gt;DOWNLOAD IT!!!! It is EXTREMELY DESTRUCTIVE and will overwrite your<BR>
&gt;ENTIRE CITY!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The "gift" is disguised as a large wooden horse about two stories tall.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;It tends to show up outside the city gates and appears to be abandoned.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;DO NOT let it through the gates! It contains hardware that is<BR>
&gt;incompatible with Trojan programming, including a crowd of heavily armed<BR>
&gt;Greek warriors that will destroy your army, sack your town, and kill<BR>
&gt;your women and children. If you have already received such a gift, DO<BR>
&gt;NOT OPEN IT! Take it back out of the city unopened and set fire to it by<BR>
&gt;the beach.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;FORWARD THIS MESSAGE TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Poseidon<BR>
&gt;<BR>

&gt;FROM: hector@studmuffin.com<BR>
&gt;TO: laocoon@doomgloom.edu<BR>
&gt;RE: Greeks bearing gifts<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Laocoon,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I hate to break to you, but this is one of the oldest hoaxes there is.<BR>
&gt;I've seen variants on this warning come through on other<BR>
&gt;listservs, one involving some kind of fruit that was supposed to kill<BR>
&gt;the people who ate it and one having to do with something called the<BR>
&gt;"Midas Touch." Here are a few tipoffs that this is a hoax:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;1) This "Forward this message to everyone you know" junk. If it were<BR>
&gt;really meant as a warning about the Greek army, why tell anyone to post<BR>
&gt;it to the Phonecians, Sumerians, and Cretans?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;2) Use of exclamation points. Always a giveaway.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;3) It's signed "from Poseidon." Granted he's had his problems with<BR>
&gt;Odysseus but he's one of their guys, isn't he? Besides, the lack of a<BR>
&gt;real header with a detailed address makes me suspicious.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;4) Technically speaking, there is no way for a horse to overwrite your<BR>
&gt;entire city. A horse is just an animal, after all.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Next time you get a message like this, just delete it. I appreciate your<BR>
&gt;concern, but once you've been around the block a couple times you'll<BR>
&gt;realize how annoying this kind of stuff is.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Bye now,<BR>
&gt;Hector<BR>
<P>
