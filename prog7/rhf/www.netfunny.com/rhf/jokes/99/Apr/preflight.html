</PRE>My dad just bought a small, single-engine plane.  Here's a pre-flight shpiel 
I wrote for him to read to his terrified passengers: 
<P>
Welcome aboard [insert pilot's name] Airlines flight 0001 departing 
[insert airfield] en route, with any luck at all, to [insert 
destination].  Please make sure your seatbelt is on and that your seat 
is securely fastened to the fuselage.  At this time, any personal items 
should be stowed securely in the trunk of your car, since there is no 
overhead compartment or space beneath your seat, to speak of.  Please 
turn off all portable electronic devices, and keep them off until we 
have landed safely, or for the duration of the flight, whichever comes 
first.  Smoking is not permitted inside the cabin; smoking outside the 
cabin should be reported to the captain immediately.  There is no 
beverage service during the flight, however, heavy drinking prior to 
takeoff is encouraged.  In-flight entertainment will consist of watching 
the pilot's desperate struggle to control the plane.  We'll be flying at 
an altitude of __[insert altitude]___ feet today, in theory; should the 
plane's altitude drop precipitously, please check to ensure that the 
pilot is awake and in an upright position.  Lavatories are located at 
either end of the flight.  As we prepare for takeoff, please take this 
opportunity to locate the exit nearest you and, if you have any sense at 
all, avail yourself of it before it's too late.  In a moment, the pilot 
will begin handing out the release forms in preparation for takeoff.  Be 
assured that in all his time aloft, Pilot [insert pilot's name] has 
never lost a passenger; however, your results may vary.  Now sit back, 
relax, and enjoy your flight. 
<P>
