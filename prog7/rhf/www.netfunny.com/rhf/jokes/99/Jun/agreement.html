<BR>Pre-Relationship Agreement<BR>
<P>
The  party  of  the  first  part (herein referred to as she/her)<BR>
being  of  sound  mind  and  fairly good body, agrees to the following<BR>
with the party of the second part (herein referred to as he/him).<BR>
<P>
1.  FULL  DISCLOSURE:  At  the  commencement  of  said relationship<BR>
(colloquially  referred  to as the first date or match up), each party<BR>
agrees  to  fully  disclose  any  current  girl/boyfriends,  dependent<BR>
children,  bizarre religious beliefs, phobias, fears, social diseases,<BR>
strange  political  affiliations,  or  currently  active relationships<BR>
with  anyone  else  that  have  not  yet been terminated. Further each<BR>
party      agrees      to      make      known     any     deep-seated<BR>
mother/father/brother/sister  complexes  and fanatical obsessions with<BR>
pets,  careers, or organized sports. Failure to make these disclosures<BR>
will  result in the  immediate termination of said relationship before<BR>
it has a chance to get anywhere.<BR>
<P>
2.  INDEMNIFICATION  OF  FRIENDS:  Both  parties  agree to hold the<BR>
person  who  arranged  the  liaison  (colloquially  referred to as the<BR>
"matchmaker")  blameless  in  the event the "fix-up" turns out to be a<BR>
"real  loser"  or "psycho bitch." (For definition of "real loser," see<BR>
"John  DeLorean:  My  Story,"  available  at  most  bookstores; George<BR>
Hamilton  at  one  of  Imelda  Marcos'  parties; or any picture of Bob<BR>
Guccione  in Penthouse.  For  definition of "psycho bitch," see Sharon<BR>
Stone in "Basic Instinct," or Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction.")<BR>
<P>
3.  DEFINITION  OF  RELATIONSHIP:  Should said relationship proceed<BR>
past  the  first  "fix-up"  both  parties  mutually  agree  to use the<BR>
following  terminology  in  describing  their  said  "dating": For the<BR>
first  thirty  (30)  days  both parties consent to say they are "going<BR>
out."  (This neither implies nor states any guarantee of exclusivity.)<BR>
Following  the  first  thirty  (30) days said parties may say they are<BR>
"seeing  somebody"  and  may  be  referred  to by third parties as "an<BR>
item."  Sixty (60) days following the commencement of the "first date"<BR>
either  member  may  elect to use the terms "girl/boyfriend" or lover"<BR>
and  their mutual acquaintances may refer to them as "a couple." Under<BR>
no  circumstances  are  the  phrases  "my  better  half,"  "the little<BR>
woman,"  "the  old  ball  and chain," or "my old man/lady"<BR>
acceptable.<BR>
Further,  if  both members of the party consent, this timetable may be<BR>
accelerated;   however,   if  either  party  "gets  too  serious"  and<BR>
disregards   this   schedule,   the   other  party  may  dissolve  the<BR>
relationship  on   the grounds of "moving too fast" and may once again<BR>
be said to be "on the market."<BR>
<P>
4.  TERMS  OF  EXCLUSIVITY:  For  the  first  thirty (30) days both<BR>
parties  agree  not  to  ask questions about the others whereabouts on<BR>
weekends,  weeknights,  or  over long holiday periods. No unreasonable<BR>
demands  or expectations will be made; both parties agree they have no<BR>
"rights"  or  "holds"  on  the  other's  time. Following the first six<BR>
weeks  or  forty-five (45) days, if one party continues to be "missing<BR>
in  action"  without  explanation, the "wounded party" agrees to "give<BR>
up."<BR>
<P>
5. DATING ETIQUETTE: For the first thirty (30) days both members of<BR>
the  couple  agree  to  be  overly  considerate  of  the  other's work<BR>
pressures,  schedules,  and business ambitions. A minimum of three (3)<BR>
phone  calls  will  be made between the two parties during the working<BR>
day,  and  each  party will attempt - with best efforts - to originate<BR>
50% of the phone calls.<BR>
Additionally,  for  the  first  two weeks all dates will be made at<BR>
least  twenty-four  (24)  hours  in advance; there will be no "running<BR>
off  in  the  middle  of the night" to console an old girl/boyfriend,"<BR>
and  both  parties  agree  to  strike the phrase "but he/she needs me"<BR>
from  their  vocabulary.  Further, during the first six (6) weeks each<BR>
member   of   said   relationship  agrees  to  attempt  at  least  one<BR>
spontaneous  "home  cooked  meal"  and will arrange the delivery of at<BR>
least  one  unexpected bouquet of flowers.  Following the first forty-<BR>
five   (45)   days   both   parties   will   return  to  their  normal<BR>
personalities.<BR>
<P>
6.  TERMS  OF  PAYMENT: It is agreed that - respective gross income<BR>
aside  -  "he"  will  pick up the tab at all dinners, clubs, theaters,<BR>
and breakfasts until:<BR>
(a) He considers her suitably impressed,<BR>
(b) we are broke, or<BR>
(c) He says, "this is ridiculous, you pay!"<BR>
Not  included  in  this  agreement are meals ordered from the bedroom,<BR>
which  are  subject to the availability of discretionary funds on hand<BR>
at the time.<BR>
<P>
7.  LIVING ARRANGEMENTS (occasionally known as the "Why do I bother<BR>
to   keep  my  own  apartment?"  codicil):  Should  said  relationship<BR>
progress  to the point where the couple spends more then five nights a<BR>
week  together,  every  effort shall be made to split the time between<BR>
their  respective  apartments.   Further, it is agreed that both sides<BR>
will  attempt  to silence the lewd remarks of landlords, or<BR>
roommates.<BR>
Additionally,  both will avoid having their mother call at 7:30 in the<BR>
morning.   He  agrees to "pick up after himself" while in residence at<BR>
her  apartment,  including  washing  his whiskers out of the sink, and<BR>
assisting  with  household  duties.  (By the same token, she agrees to<BR>
respect  his right to keep his apartment "a mess.")  (Especially since<BR>
we tend to excel in this area!)<BR>
<P>
8. THE 90 DAY GRACE PERIOD: For the first three months, each member<BR>
of  the  couple agrees to hold the other blameless in the euphoric use<BR>
of  phrases  like  "Let's  move  in  together,"  "Why don't we start a<BR>
family?"  and -- using  archaic  terminology--"Let's get married."<BR>
Additionally,  each  party  agrees to love, cherish, honor, and defend<BR>
the other party's right not to meet his parents.<BR>
<P>
9.  THE  "L" WORD: For the first sixty (60) days both parties agree<BR>
not  to  use  the  phrase  "I  love you."  They may love plants, dogs,<BR>
cats,  cars, concerts, or the way a particular pair of jeans fits, but<BR>
not  each  other.   Failure  by  one  party to abide by this rule will<BR>
result in the other party using the "G" word . . . "Gone."<BR>
<P>
10.  GROUNDS  FOR  TERMINATION: Any of the following will be grounds<BR>
for immediate termination and final dissolution of said relationship:<BR>
(a) Excessive use of chatty French phrases;<BR>
(b) Ending any argument with the sentence "My ex- used to do<BR>
that same thing";<BR>
(c) Suggesting - no matter how kindly - that the other<BR>
member should seek "help";<BR>
(d) ending any argument with the phrase "My analyst<BR>
thinks you are..."; and<BR>
(e) complaining more than twice about the contents of the<BR>
other party's refrigerator (or lack thereof) .<BR>
<P>
11.  DECLARATION  OF  STRENGTH:  At  the  time of breakup each party<BR>
reserves  the  right to make the other feel guilty by using one or all<BR>
of the following phrases:<BR>
(a) "You'll never find anybody better";<BR>
(b) "Nobody could ever make you happy";<BR>
(c) "I'll find somebody who can really appreciate me"; and<BR>
(d) "My analyst thinks you are .. . ." (Psychosis to be<BR>
filled in at the proper time.)<BR>
<P>
12. MISCELLANEOUS:<BR>
(a) Each party agrees to give the other at least five minutes'<BR>
notice before terminating said relationship;<BR>
(b) Both parties agree to remain exclusive until such time as<BR>
the relationship appear to be "on the rocks";<BR>
(c) At the termination of said affair:<BR>
(1) both parties agree to be mature and return compiled<BR>
socks, sweatshirts, books, record albums, door keys,<BR>
personal undergarments with all due haste through an<BR>
impartial intermediary;<BR>
(2) each party agrees to wait at least seventy-two (72)<BR>
hours before engaging in sex with any of the other's<BR>
friends;<BR>
(3) both parties agree to refrain from slandering the other<BR>
for a period of at least seven days (bedroom<BR>
performance included), and further consent to use one<BR>
of the following nebulous terms in the description of<BR>
the breakup:<BR>
"The timing wasn't right";<BR>
"He/She wanted more than I could give";<BR>
"He/She was too involved in his/her career";<BR>
"He/She decided to go back with his/her<BR>
(a) girl/boyfriend;<BR>
(b) last lover;<BR>
(c) hometown;<BR>
(d) therapist."<BR>
<P>
13.  ADDENDUM:  After  the  initial  breakup  -  no matter what - both<BR>
parties agree to give the relationship "one more shot."<BR>
<P>
