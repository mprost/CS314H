</PRE>Here are more Kosovo quickies.  These are jokes which are funny, but which 
didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post such a digest whenever I 
have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly selective readers will 
probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to killfile RHF jokes with 
"Digest" in the title - ed.

Now being posted on Chinese Embassy notice boards:<BR>

&gt;Subject: Lost in Belgrade<BR>
<P>
It's no wonder the missile got lost.  I mean,<BR>
how many landmarks does Belgrade have left?<BR>

&gt;From: jokemaster@x.tc (Jokemaster)<BR>
&gt;Subject: Third Time Lucky....<BR>
<P>
Political commentators have expressed surprise at the strong public support<BR>
in Germany for military action in Kosovo - something that goes against<BR>
their predominantly pacifist trend over recent years.<BR>
<P>
I don't see why it's all that surprising - after all, it's their last<BR>
chance this century to end a war on the winning side.<BR>

&gt;Subject: Safety first!<BR>
<P>
How do you cross the street in Belgrade?<BR>
<P>
Look left, look right, look up - if all is clear, cross it.<BR>

&gt;Subject: Another priceless Mastercard advertisement<BR>
<P>
Lockheed F-16 Fighting Falcon - $25 million dollars<BR>
Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk Stealth Fighter - $45 million dollars.<BR>
Boeing B-52 Stratofortress - $74 million dollars.<BR>
Brand new B-2 Stealth Bomber - $2.1 billion dollars.<BR>
A decent map of downtown Belgrade - Priceless.<BR>
<P>
There are some things that money can buy... unfortunately good<BR>
intelligence isn't one of them.<BR>
<P>
For the rest, there's MasterCard, the official card of the 19 member<BR>
NATO alliance and those who believe that sometimes you just need to blow<BR>
up something in order to restore peace.<BR>
