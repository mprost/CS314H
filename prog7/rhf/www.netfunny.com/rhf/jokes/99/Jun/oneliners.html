Try using these some time....... 
<P>
</PRE>1)   Ahhh...I see the fuck-up fairy has visited us again... 
<P>
2)   The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an artist. 
<P>
3)   I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce. 
<P>
4)   Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental. 
<P>
5)   I have plenty of talent and vision. I just don't give a damn. 
<P>
6)   I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid. 
<P>
7)   What am I? Flypaper for freaks!? 
<P>
8)   I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant. 
<P>
9)   I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth. 
<P>
10)  Thank you. We're all refreshed and challenged by your unique point 
of view. 
<P>
11)  I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you. 
<P>
12)  It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off. 
<P>
13)  No, my powers can only be used for good. 
<P>
14)  How about never? Is never good for you? 
<P>
15)  I'm really easy to get along with once you people learn to worship me. 
<P>
16)  You sound reasonable...Time to up my medication. 
<P>
17)  I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter. 
<P>
18)  I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message... 
<P>
19)  I don't work here. I'm a consultant. 
<P>
20)  Who me? I just wander from room to room. 
<P>
21)  My toys! My toys! I can't do this job without my toys! 
<P>
22)  It might look like I'm doing nothing, but at the cellular level I'm really 
quite busy. 
<P>
23)  At least I have a positive attitude about my destructive habits. 
<P>
24)  You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers. 
<P>
25)  I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public. 
<P>
26)  Someday, we'll look back on this, laugh nervously and change the subject. 
<P>
