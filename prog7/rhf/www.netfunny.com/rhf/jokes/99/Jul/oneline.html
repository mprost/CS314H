</PRE>What follows are the latest entries in the one-liner file.  These are jokes 
which are funny, but which didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post 
such a digest whenever I have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly 
selective readers will probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to 
killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in the title. 
<P>
Some of these entries are particularly sick, so if you're not into that 
kind of thing, skip this one - ed.
