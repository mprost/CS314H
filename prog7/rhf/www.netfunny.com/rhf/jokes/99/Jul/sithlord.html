</PRE>Position Available Immediately:  Apprentice Sith Lord, Dark Side 
Consulting Group 
<P>
An unexpected position has opened up in the Dark Side Consulting Group 
for an Apprentice Sith Lord.  The ideal candidate for this position 
would like galactic travel and possess a complete understanding of and 
competence with the Force, or demonstrate a willingness to learn. 
<P>
Duties include:  Performing competitive intelligence, hands-on 
intervention in support of the Sith Master's planning initiatives, 
ability to travel the galaxy widely, and operating a variety of 
laser-powered hand weapons and high-powered space/air vehicles. Some 
slaying of enemies of the Dark Side is also required, which may be 
performed using the Force or hand weapons. 
<P>
Qualified applicants would possess good communications skills 
(especially when speaking in menacing whispers), and would be 
action-oriented individuals and risk takers.  A background in study of 
the Force (light side or dark) is desirable, as would typically be 
acquired by those with advanced degrees or significant course work in 
Jedi Arts from the University of Coruscant.  Applicants should also be 
familiar with holographic projection equipment, possess a valid 
galactic pilot's license (for all classes of ships), and must show a 
willingness to give in to their hate.  A proven track record of using 
fear and/or Jedi mind tricks to control others is also desirable, as is 
the ability to speak several galactic languages. 
<P>
Ideal candidates for this position would also have no children or other 
living relatives who are strong in the ways of the Force.  (A new hire 
would be given several weeks to meet this requirement.) 
<P>
Compensation for this position is commensurate with experience, and is 
extremely competitive for this field.  Benefits include a generous 
severance package, a company starship, and a dark-colored clothing 
allowance. 
<P>
The Apprentice Sith Lord reports to and works closely with the Sith 
Master, and experience in such small, team-based organizations is vital 
to the success of the master's plans.  Discretion is also highly 
valued, as is the ability to see the future before it happens. 
<P>
Applications will be accepted until the end of July.  Transmit them 
holographically to:  jobs@darkside.com . 
<P>

</PRE>Dark Side CG (tm) is a small and highly-focused organization, founded a 
long time ago.  Our core values reflect the short-term advantages of 
harnessing hatred for institutional power and the long-term 
desirability of controlling the galaxy.  We provide direction to our 
partner organizations through knowledge management, incident control 
and our rapid on-site intervention expertise.  Our partnered 
organizations include the Imperial Senate, the Hutt Gambling Collective 
of Tattooine, and many large software companies.
