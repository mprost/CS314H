</PRE>A woman was out shopping and her son was with her.  They boy spotted a man who 
was bowlegged.  The boy pulled on Mom's hand and said, " Momma, look at the 
bowlegged man."  Mom was mortified and told her son that it was not polite to 
point to a person and make that sort of comment. For punishment, the boy had to 
read a play by Shakespeare.  He couldn't go shopping again until he finished 
reading the play. Finally he finished and his mom took him out again to the 
mall shopping. 
<P>
Once again he spied a bowlegged man, but remembered what happened the last 
time.  So he pulled on his mother's hand and said, "Lo, what manner of man 
are these, who wear their balls in parentheses?"
