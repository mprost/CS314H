<P>
<BR>Day 1:<BR>
Just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary with not much to celebrate.<BR>
When it came time to re-enact our wedding night, HE locked himself in the<BR>
bathroom and cried.<BR>
<P>
Day 2:<BR>
Today he says he has a big secret to tell me.  He's impotent.  He wants me<BR>
to be the first to know.  Why doesn't he tell me something I DON'T know! I<BR>
mean, give me a break.  He's been dysfunctional for so long, he even WALKS<BR>
with a limp.<BR>
<P>
Day 3:<BR>
This marriage is in trouble.  A woman has needs.  Yesterday I saw a picture<BR>
of the Washington Monument and burst into tears.<BR>
<P>
Day 4:<BR>
A miracle has happened!  There's a new drug on the market that will fix his<BR>
"problem."  It's called Viagra.  I told him that if he takes Viagra, things<BR>
will be just like they were on our wedding night.  He said, "This time, I'd<BR>
rather not have your mother join us." (I think this will work.  I replaced<BR>
his Prozac with the Viagra, hoping to lift something other than his mood.)<BR>
<P>
Day 7:<BR>
This Viagra thing has gone to his head.  (No pun intended.) Yesterday at<BR>
Burger King, the manager asked me if I'd like a Whopper.  He thought they<BR>
were talking about him.  GET OVER YOURSELF!  Not everything is about you!<BR>
<P>
Day 8:<BR>
I think he took too many over the weekend.  Yesterday, instead of mowing the<BR>
lawn, he was using his new friend as a weed wacker.<BR>
<P>
Day 10:<BR>
Okay, I admit it.  I'm hiding.  I mean, a girl can only take so much.  To<BR>
make matters worse, he's washing the Viagra down with Hard Cider!  The photo<BR>
of Janet Reno isn't working.  What am I going to do?<BR>
<P>
Day 11:<BR>
The side effects are starting to get to him.  Everything is turning blue.<BR>
The other day we were watching Kenneth Branaugh in Hamlet.  He thought it<BR>
was "The Smurfs Do Denmark."<BR>
<P>
Day 12:<BR>
I'm basically being drilled to death.  It's like going out with Black and<BR>
Decker.<BR>
<P>
Day 13:<BR>
I wish he was gay.  I bought 400 Liza Minelli albums and I keep saying<BR>
"fabulous" and still he keeps coming after me!<BR>
<P>
Day 14:<BR>
Now I know how Saddam Hussein's wife feels.  Every time I shut my eyes,<BR>
there's a sneak attack!  It's like going to bed with a scud missile.  Let's<BR>
hope he's like President Bush and pulls out in 100 days.<BR>
<P>
Day 15:<BR>
I've done everything to turn him off.  Nothing is working.  I even started<BR>
dressing like a nun.  Now he tells me "Sister Wendy" revs his motor.<BR>
<P>
Day 16:<BR>
I may just have to kill him!  Then he'll go out the way he wants to:<BR>
STIFF!  But with my luck, I probably won't be able to close the casket.<BR>
