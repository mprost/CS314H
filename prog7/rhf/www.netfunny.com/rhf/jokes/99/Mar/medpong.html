</PRE>OK, Sports fans...it's Saturday night, 3 am and time for inter-service 
hospital ping pong. Staff Internal Medicine has won the tossup and has 
elected to receive. The other services are in position and here comes the 
first patient!! 
<P>
Chief Complaint: "feel bad" 
<P>
History: Mr. Amos Leeks, 59 Y/0, 385 pound alcoholic, diabetic, 
hypertensive male with history of three old myocardial infarcts, angina, 
congestive heart failure, COPD, chronic renal insufficiency, gout, 
hypothyroidism and "nerves." 
<P>
The Medicine service jumps into position. Dr. Shafer Goodloe, medical 
raconteur, man-about-town and big time babe magnet gets the nod from the 
referee. Shafer enters the room with a spotless white coat, stiff bow tie 
and gleaming implements of destruction hanging from every pocket. 
<P>
The clock starts....Dr. Goodloe jauntily saunters into the room and sidles 
up to the patient with a big cheesy smile.... 
<P>
"Hi there Mr. Leeks...ever been in the Army?" 
<P>
"Yeah, but they threw me out for flat feet." 
<P>
"Well....in the interest of continuity of care, we feel that you should 
return to a Veterans Administration Hospital. The doctors there are 
familiar with these problems and they can follow you in perpetuity" 
<P>
PINGGGG! 
<P>
"Naaaa...I don't like that place. The nurses are ugly and they let a bunch 
of smart ass kids in white coats practice on me when they thought I wasn't 
looking....I want to stay right here and have you take care of me." 
<P>
FOUL! Serve again.... 
<P>
Shafer assumes his most intense young doctor countenance..... 
<P>
"Hi there Mr. Leeks....... got any pain right here (does hand stand on 
Amos's right upper quadrant). 
<P>
"Arrrggghhh!" 
<P>
PINGGGG....Surgery consult. 
<P>
"Hello, Surgery...we got a guy down here with excruciating right upper 
quadrant pain, mild jaundice and a history of fatty food intolerance." He 
needs to be on the surgery service. 
<P>
"What else is wrong with him" 
<P>
"Oh, just a few minor medical ailments" 
<P>
"How much does he weigh?" 
<P>
Oh, maybe three hundred and.."  (click) 
<P>
PONGGGG! 
<P>
Shafer's face darkens.......... 
<P>
"Say...Mr. Leeks....ever taken any Valium?" 
<P>
"Yeah....someone gave me some once." 
<P>
PINGGGG! Psychiatry consult... 
<P>
"Hello, psychiatry...we got a guy down here who looks pretty depressed. May 
be suicidal. Has a history of Valium abuse. He needs to be on the Psych 
service." 
<P>
OK, just have him sign a consent for electro-convulsive therapy and send 
him around in the morning. We'll buzz him till he sees God." 
<P>
"What about his work up?" 
<P>
"What about it?" (click) 
<P>
PONGGGG! 
<P>
Shafer begins to sweat and his bow tie droops....the other services 
nervously shift from foot to foot.... 
<P>
"Say...Mr. Leeks.....got any pain here? (pops Lumbar 5 with ball peen hammer). 
<P>
"Yeeeooouuch!" 
<P>
PINGGGG! Orthopedics consult. 
<P>
"Hello, Orthopods...we got a guy down here with exquisite low back pain 
radiating to both legs, he needs to be admitted to Ortho." 
<P>
"What day is today?" 
<P>
"Saturday" 
<P>
"Sorry, back pain only on Tuesdays and alternate Thursdays.  Make him a 
clinic appointment for three weeks." (click) 
<P>
PONGGGG! 
<P>
Metaphorically speaking, Shafer takes the gloves off...No more Mr. 
nice-guy.... 
<P>
"Hi there Mr. Leeks.......have any pain in your head? (Shines 
quartz-halogen light in left pupil dilated with homatropine)" 
<P>
"Hoooooaaaaaaaaarrrrrgggggghhhhh!" 
<P>
PINGGGG! Neurosurgery consult. 
<P>
"Hello, Neurosurg....got a guy down here with an exquisite headache 
accompanied by flashing lights and not relieved by anything. He needs to be 
admitted to you." 
<P>
"Hey....no problem...get him a CAT scan with and without contrast, lumbar 
puncture, angiogram, EEG, put him on your service and we'll consult on him 
in the morning" (click). 
<P>
PONGGGG! 
<P>
Medical team calls time out, stops the clock and pulls into a huddle. As 
they whisper and murmur..a Senior Medical Student pops up to see if the 
patient is still there...he is. After a moment they break and return to the 
game with broad grins. 
<P>
"Hello...OB-GYN....we got a woman down here with an imperforate hymen, 
adreno-genital syndrome and bilateral femoro-labial hernias...." 
<P>
Whoosh.......Crash... 
<P>
Point..Set..Game! 
<P>
