</PRE>Dear Mr. Cameron: 
<P>
As a courtesy, we are sending you a copy of this letter we recently 
wrote your 15 year old daughter in response to a query we received from 
her. 
<P>
Dear Ms. Cameron. 
<P>
Thank you for your letter. Yes, we are pleased to report, your father's 
old high school is still standing and our library was able to find 
yearbooks dating "all the way back" to his graduation. In fact, a few 
teachers even remember your father, which I will get to in a moment. 
<P>
In answer to your first question:  In every picture extant of your 
father he is well shod, wearing what I believe were called "earth shoes" 
back then.  Also, the weather here is moderate, with snow generally 
lasting from December until March--hardly the entire school year.  Thus 
his descriptions of the conditions under which he "struggled" to school 
in the morning do, as you suggested, seem a bit exaggerated. In fact, 
our bus logs are (remarkably) still intact, revealing that not only was 
your father a registered passenger, but that his parents paid the extra 
ten dollars a month for door-to-door delivery. 
<P>
I am sure there were days when your father was very "sharply dressed," 
as you state he puts it, but in every single photograph I was able to 
uncover he is wearing exactly the same thing: bell bottom blue jeans 
with white strings trailing from the edges onto the floor, horizontal 
rents in the knees, and no belt buckle.  His T-shirt displays a message 
easily communicated with hand gestures.  His hair hangs past his 
shoulders and looks as if it was exposed to a lot of wind - perhaps he 
rode the school bus with the window open. 
<P>
As to academics and "concentrating on the basics," one must remember the 
times: the "basics" back then may very well have embraced some of your 
father's elective subjects, which included "Personal Citizenship," 
"Ecology," and one which apparently was called "Relevance."  We have no 
record of what, if anything, was taught in these classes.  What records 
we do have show that your father did indeed take Geometry, just as he 
claims. In fact, he took it his sophomore year, repeated it his junior 
year and repeated the course again his senior year - Geometry was 
required for graduation. 
<P>
Now as to Mr. Muggins, who had your father in a class called "Problems 
of Modern Relationships."  Mr. Muggins does not wish to dispute the 
claim that your father always had his homework done early, he merely 
wants to point out that no matter when it was done, it was always handed 
in late.  In fact, your father sticks out in Mr. Muggins's mind as 
having the most outrageous excuses for being unprepared, including 
having to evacuate his home because it was infected with the China 
Syndrome. 
<P>
Your father was not, sad to say, President of the Student Council. 
Perhaps he is confusing student government with a social group called 
"The Slackers," which Mr. Muggins recalls was a group of boys who sat in 
the hallway and made loud groaning noises whenever an attractive girl 
strode past. Your father was assistant vice president of the club, and, 
to our knowledge, is the only past member not currently serving time in 
a federal penitentiary. 
<P>
One thing IS completely verifiable: your father's name is, indeed, 
carved above the door to the school.  Please advise that, now that we 
have noticed it, we will need to have it sanded out and refinished, at a 
cost of approximately three hundred dollars.  We would appreciate it if 
your father would agree to pay for the damage without having to engage 
lawyers. 
<P>
The honor roll to which he apparently referred is not above the door, it 
hangs outside my office.  I will leave unanswered the question as to 
whether his name is upon it. 
<P>
Thank you very much for your letter, which we found most amusing.  Be 
sure to tell your father hello from Mr. Muggins. 
<P>
