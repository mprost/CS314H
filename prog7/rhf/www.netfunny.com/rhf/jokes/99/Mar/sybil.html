</PRE>A recent newspaper article stated that "Sybil," subject of a book and movie 
about her multiple personalities, had passed away. Here's a short version 
of her autobiography: 
<P>
Group Therapy 
<P>
<BR>I've started a support group for my personalities.<BR>
We go around the room and share with all the other me's.<BR>
I've numbered them from 1 through 10 so I can keep them straight.<BR>
But 4 eloped with 7, so for now I'm down to eight.<BR>
<P>
Number 9 is suing me, she claims she's been abused,<BR>
Because I never let her out, her self esteem is bruised.<BR>
Number 3's a lawyer and she took 9's case for gratis.<BR>
8 and 6 agree with 9 and want class action status.<BR>
<P>
10 approached me yesterday...could she live on her own?<BR>
She's found a job but needs a car...would I co-sign a loan?<BR>
I've been told that number 1 revealed in therapy<BR>
That she has several egos too, and one of them is me.<BR>
<P>
Number 5 just cracks me up. I love her sense of humor.<BR>
3 tells me that 5 is gay, but 8 says that's just rumor.<BR>
The strangest one is number 2. I think her brain is fried.<BR>
She's always playing with her guns and speaks of homicide.<BR>
<P>
I've talked about each one of them with my psychiatrist.<BR>
They won't come to his office so he thinks they don't exist.<BR>
He says that I'm just paranoid and schizophrenic too.<BR>
But they all think that he's a quack who doesn't have a clue.<BR>
<P>
So I began my little group so they could be involved<BR>
In helping one another see their issues get resolved.<BR>
Although there are a bunch of me's who feel the need to share,<BR>
They're easy to accomodate...we only need one chair.<BR>
