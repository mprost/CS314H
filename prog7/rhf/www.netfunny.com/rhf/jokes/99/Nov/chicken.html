<BR>JERRY FALWELL<BR>
Because the chicken was gay! Isn't it obvious? Can't you people<BR>
see the plain truth in front of your face? The chicken was going to<BR>
the "other side." That's what "they" call it, the "other side."<BR>
Yes, my friends, that chicken is gay. And, if you eat that chicken,<BR>
you will become gay too. I say we boycott all chickens until we sort<BR>
out this abomination that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly<BR>
harmless phrases like "the other side." That chicken should not be<BR>
free to cross the road. It's as plain and simple as that.<BR>
<P>
PAT BUCHANAN<BR>
To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American.<BR>
<P>
DR. SEUSS<BR>
Did the chicken cross the road?<BR>
Did he cross it with a toad?<BR>
Yes! The chicken crossed the road,<BR>
but why it crossed, I've not been told!<BR>
<P>
ERNEST HEMINGWAY<BR>
To die. In the rain.<BR>
<P>
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.<BR>
I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads<BR>
without having their motives called into question.<BR>
<P>
GRANDPA<BR>
In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone<BR>
told us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough<BR>
for us.<BR>
<P>
ARISTOTLE<BR>
It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.<BR>
<P>
KARL MARX<BR>
It was a historical inevitability.<BR>
<P>
SADDAM HUSSEIN<BR>
This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in<BR>
dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.<BR>
<P>
RONALD REAGAN<BR>
What chicken?<BR>
<P>
KEN STARR<BR>
I intend to prove that the chicken crossed the road at the behest of<BR>
the president of the United States of America in an effort to distract<BR>
law enforcement officials and the American public from the criminal<BR>
wrongdoing our highest elected official has been trying to cover up.<BR>
As a result, the chicken is just another pawn in the president's<BR>
ongoing and elaborate scheme to obstruct justice and undermine the<BR>
rule of law. For that reason, my staff intends to offer the chicken<BR>
unconditional immunity provided he cooperates fully with our<BR>
investigation. Furthermore, the chicken will not be permitted to reach<BR>
the other side of the road until our investigation and any<BR>
Congressional follow-up investigations have been completed. (We<BR>
also are investigating whether Sid Blumenthal has leaked information<BR>
to the Rev.Jerry Falwell, alleging the chicken to be homosexual in an<BR>
effort to discredit any useful testimony the bird may have to offer,<BR>
or at least to ruffle his feathers.)<BR>
<P>
CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK<BR>
To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.<BR>
<P>
FOX MULDER<BR>
You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens<BR>
have to cross before you believe it?<BR>
<P>
FREUD<BR>
The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the<BR>
road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.<BR>
<P>
BILL GATES<BR>
I have just released eChicken 98, which will not only cross roads,<BR>
but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your<BR>
checkbook-and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.<BR>
<P>
EINSTEIN<BR>
Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath<BR>
the chicken?<BR>
<P>
BILL CLINTON<BR>
I did not cross the road with THAT chicken.<BR>
What do you mean by chicken?<BR>
Could you define chicken please?<BR>
<P>
LOUIS FARRAKHAN<BR>
The road, you will see, represents the black man. The chicken<BR>
crossed the "black man" in order to trample him and keep him down.<BR>
<P>
THE BIBLE<BR>
And God came down from the heavens, and He said unto the chicken,<BR>
"Thou shalt cross the road." And the chicken crossed the road, and<BR>
there was much rejoicing.<BR>
<P>
COLONEL SANDERS<BR>
I missed one?<BR>
