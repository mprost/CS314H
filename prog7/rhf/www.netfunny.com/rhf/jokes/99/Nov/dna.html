<P>
</PRE>I've been single-stranded too long! Lonely ATGCATG would like to pair up 
with congenial TACGTAC. 
<P>
Menage a trois! Ligand seeks two receptors into binding and mutual 
phosphorylation. Let's get together and transduce some signals. 
<P>
Some dates have called me a promotor. Others have referred to me as a real 
operator. Personally, I think I'm just a cute piece of DNA who is still 
looking for that special transcription factor to help me unwind. 
<P>
Highly sensitive, orally active small molecule seeks stable well-structured 
receptor who knows size isn't everything. 
<P>
There must be a rational way to meet a date! I'm tired of hanging out in 
those molecular diversity bars, hoping to randomly bump into the right 
peptide. I want a molecule that will fit right into my active site and 
really turn me on. I'll send you my crystal structure if you send me 
yours! 
<P>
Gene therapy graduate. After years of producing nothing but gibberish, I've 
shed my exons and am ready to express my introns. All I need is a cute 
vector to introduce me to the right host. 
<P>
My RNA, I'm sorry I misread your UAAUAAUAA and inserted three tyrosines 
when you repeatedly asked me to stop. Something got lost in the 
translation. Please forgive me. 
<P>
Naked DNA with sticky ends seeks kanamycin-resistant plasmid. EcoR1 sites 
preferred. 
<P>
Uninhibited virus seeks reason to make me shed my coat protein. 
<P>
This very selective oliogonucleotide has been probing for just the right 
target for long term hybridization. 
<P>
Mature cell seeks same who still enjoys cycling and won't go apoptotic on 
me. Let's fight senescence together! 
<P>
I'm a prolific progenitor with great potential for growth and self-renewal. 
Call me if you're a potent hematopoietic factor who still believes in 
endless nights of colony stimulation. 
<P>
I don't always express myself on the surface, but I'm looking for a signal 
that you appreciate my complexity. Send me the right message that will 
penetrate my membranes, turn on my protein expression and release my 
potential energy. 
<P>
