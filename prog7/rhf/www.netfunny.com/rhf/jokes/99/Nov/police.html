</PRE>One day, a teacher was teaching her class of eight year old children. 
At the beginning of the lesson she asked them to write a short essay on 
their views of the police force.  As she was reading through them at the 
end of the day, she noticed little Johnny had only written one sentence; 
<P>
"Police is bastards." 
<P>
Naturally, she was quite concerned.  So, she thought the best way to 
rectify this would be to take the children for a day out at the local 
Police station. 
<P>
The next day, the children all went on a school outing to the local 
Police station, and they all had a brilliant time.  They got shown round 
the cells, and were given lots of cakes and fizzy drinks.  The day after 
the visit, the teacher asked them all to write a short essay on their 
views of the Police force based on their visit the day before.  As she 
was reading through them at the end of the day she noticed that little 
Johnny had again only written one sentence; 
<P>
"Police is cunning bastards."
