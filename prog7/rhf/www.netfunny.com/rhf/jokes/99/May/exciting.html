</PRE>Three old timers were relating their most exciting experiences. 
<P>
The first, a retired sheriff, described the terrifying excitement of 
a shoot-out with Bonnie and Clyde back in his younger days. 
The other gents nodded and agreed that that, indeed, would 
have been exciting. 
<P>
The second, a retired fireman, related the tale of a huge fire at 
the university several years back.  There were flames, firetrucks 
from several area fire departments, but the most exciting part 
were the naked coeds jumping from their dorm windows into his 
arms.  The others gents agreed that had to be a very exciting 
time. 
<P>
The third guy started, "I was an undertaker.  One night I got a 
call to pick up a body that was under a sheet in a hotel room. 
When I got there, the guy had a huge erection.  I knew there 
was no way I could get him through the lobby like that.  So I 
found an old broom and whacked that erection just as hard as I 
could to make it go down."  He paused.  The retired fireman 
asked, "So, how was that exciting?" 
<P>
The undertaker answered, "Well, you see, I was in the wrong 
room."
