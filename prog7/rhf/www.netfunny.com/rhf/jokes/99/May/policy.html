</PRE><P>
Due to the current financial situation, changes will be made to the 
Business Travel standards and Procedures Manual. Effective Monday the 
following revised procedures apply: 
<P>
Lodging 
<P>
All employees are encouraged to stay with relatives and friends while on 
business travel. If weather permits, public areas such as parks should be 
used as temporary lodging sites. Bus terminals, train stations, and office 
lobbies may provide shelter in periods of inclement weather. 
<P>
Transportation 
<P>
Hitchhiking is the preferred mode of travel in lieu of commercial 
transport. Luminescent safety vests will be issued to all employees prior 
to their departure on business trips. Bus transportation will be used only 
when work schedules require such travel. Airline tickets will be authorized 
in extreme circumstances and the lowest fares will be used. For example, if 
a meeting is scheduled in Seattle, but the lower fare can be obtained by 
traveling to Detroit, then travel to Detroit will be substituted for travel 
to Seattle. 
<P>
Meals 
<P>
Expenditures for meals will be limited to an absolute minimum. It should be 
noted that certain grocery and specialty chains, such as Hickory Farms, 
General Nutrition centers, and, Costco, Sams stores etc. often provide free 
samples of promotional items. Entire meals can be obtained in this manner. 
Travelers should also be familiar with indigenous roots, berries, and other 
protein sources available at their destinations. If restaurants must be 
utilized, travelers should use "all you can eat" salad bars. This is 
especially effective for employees traveling together as one plate can be 
used to feed the entire group. Employees are also encouraged to bring their 
own food on business travel. Cans of tuna fish, Spam, and Beefaroni can be 
consumed at your leisure without the necessary bother of heating or costly 
preparation. 
<P>
Miscellaneous 
<P>
All employees are encouraged to devise innovative techniques in effort to 
save company dollars. One enterprising individual has already suggested 
that money could be raised during airport layover periods which could be 
used to defray travel expenses. In support of this idea, red caps will be 
issued to all employees prior to their departure so that they may earn tips 
by helping others with their luggage. Small plastic roses and ball point 
pens will also be available to employees so that sales may be made as time 
permits.
