</PRE>[Seen on misc.market at Carnegie Mellon University] 
<P>
It's been amazing. 
You've been out on a date with this sweet woman.  She's 
so wonderful.  She's all you've ever hoped for. 
<P>
What's better.  She wants to fool around with you after 
the date . . . . at your place!!  Alright.  Home turf. 
You two somehow manage your way into the bedroom and you're 
getting your swerve on when suddenly the phone rings.  You 
try to ignore it, but there's just no way.  From the darkness, 
you hear the sweetest voice say, "Aren't you going to answer it?" 
With a quickness only known by horny 20-something's, you reach 
for the phone when you realize, "CRAP!!  NO NIGHTSTAND FOR THE PHONE!!!" 
You fall backward off the bed, landing on the phone and spraining 
your neck.  Now, you're being driven to the hospital by this 
nice girl who is thinking "What a comeplete moron.  He can't even 
buy a friggin nightstand."  You're injured, embarrassed and 
definitely not gettin' any.  All because of a lack of nightstand. 
<P>
Don't be stupid.  Buy mine.  $15. 
<P>
