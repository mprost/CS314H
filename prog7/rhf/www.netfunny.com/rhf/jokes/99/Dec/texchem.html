<P>
</PRE>Today I took two 35mm films for processing at a local Wal-Mart here in 
London, Ontario. 
<P>
One film was fine, as always, but the girl told me that they didn't 
process the other one, "And it's just as well we didn't, or we would have 
erased all of your pictures." 
<P>
She told me it wasn't a film that used the C-41 process. "Are you sure?" I 
asked. 
<P>
She then showed me the film canister, and showed me some small print on 
the canister: "Austin, Tx 78744," and said, "That's not a chemical we deal 
with." 
<P>
"That's Austin, Texas, and the zipcode, it's the address of the 
manufacturer. I'm pretty sure it's a C-41 film." I pointed out. 
<P>
"No," she said, "that's not a chemical we deal with." 
<P>
I would have argued, but both myself and my girlfriend were having trouble 
keeping a straight face, so we paid for the first film and left. 
<P>
Which leaves me with a problem. Does anyone out there have Big Texan Film 
Chemicals to process my film for me? 
<P>
