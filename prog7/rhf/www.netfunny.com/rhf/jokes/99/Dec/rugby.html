<P>
</PRE>Seeing how the All Blacks were motivated by performing "The Haka" before 
their world cup games, the other nations were asked to suggest pre-match 
rituals of their own. 
<P>
The England team will chat about the weather, wave hankies in the air 
and attach bells to their ankles for a while before moaning about how 
they invented the game, and gave it to the world, and how it's not fair 
that everyone can beat them now. 
<P>
The Scotland team will chant "You lookin' at me Pal? before smashing an 
Irn Bru bottle over their opponents heads. 
<P>
The Ireland team will spilt into two, with the Southern half performing 
Riverdance, while the Northerners march the Traditional route from their 
dressing room to the pitch, via their opponents dressing room. 
<P>
Unfortunately the Welsh suggestion has been vetoed by the RSPCA. 
<P>
Argentina will unexpectedly invade a small part of opposition territory, 
claim it as their own "Las In-Goals-Areas" and then be forceably removed 
by the Stewards. 
<P>
Two members of the South African team will claim to be more important 
than the other thirteen whom they will corral between the posts whilst 
they claim the rest of the pitch for themselves. 
<P>
The Americans will not be there until half time. In future years they 
will alter the records to show that they were in fact the most important 
team in the tournament and Hollywood will make a film called "Saving No 
8 Lyle." 
<P>
Five of the Canadian team will sing La Marsaillaise and hold the rest of 
the side to ransom. 
<P>
The Italian team will arrive in red penis extensions, sexually harass 
the female stewards and then run away. 
<P>
The Spanish will sneak into the other half of the pitch, mow it, and 
then claim that it was all in line with the European "grass quotas." 
They will then curl up under the posts and have a kip until half time. 
<P>
The Japanese will attempt to strengthen their team by offering good 
salaries to the key opposition players (over 35) and then run around the 
pitch at high speed in a highly efficient manner before buying the 
ground (with a subsidy from the UK Government). 
<P>
The French will declare they have new scientific evidence that the 
opposition are in fact all mad. They will then park lorries across the 
halfway line, let sheep lose in the opposition half and burn the 
officials. 
<P>
The Australians will have a barbie before negotiating lucrative singing 
and TV contracts in the UK. They will then invite their mates to come 
and live with them in Shepherds Bush before beating up all the women on 
the touchline. 
<P>
