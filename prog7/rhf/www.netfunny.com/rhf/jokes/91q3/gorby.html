News analysts on CNN claim that the Acting Soviet President, Gennadi 
Yanaev, was originally selected by Gorbachev because he was "pliable," 
and "weak-willed." 
<P>
Aren't these the same qualities that led George Bush to select Dan 
Quayle...?

Mikhail Gorbachev was on vacation at his summer home in the Crimea when 
his close advisors placed him under house arrest and staged a coup. 
<P>
Upon hearing the news at his summer home in Kennebunkport, President Bush 
rushed back to Washington, cutting his vacation short. 
<P>
Looks like Bush learned at least one lesson from recent events.

Don't know if this got any coverage in the States, but the Paris 
newspaper <I>Liberation</I> today quoted Boris Yeltsin as commenting: 
<P>
"You can build a throne out of bayonets, but you can't sit on 
it for very long."

Did you know that Gorbachev really was sick? 
<P>
He had a bad case of the 24 hour coup.

The overthrow of Gorbachev was so badly botched, I'm starting to wonder if it 
was thought up by the Coup Klutz Klan.

From the CIMX morning radio show: 
<P>
(in a thick Russian accent) "Help, I've fallen from power and I 
can't get up!" 
<P>
"OK, Mr. Gorbachev, we've called your immediate family and the 
major Western heads of state and help is on the way."
