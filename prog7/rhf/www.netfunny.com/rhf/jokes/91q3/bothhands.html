<PRE>[heard from a friend]

A man with a bad stomach complaint goes to his local doctor and asks
him what he can do.  The doctor replies that the illness is quite
serious but can be cured with a small course of two suppos- itories
inserted deep up the back passage.  The man agrees, and so the doctor
warns him of the pain, tells him to bend over, and shoves the thing way
up his behind.  The doctor then hands him the second dose and tells him
to do the same thing in six hours time using rubber gloves and KY-Jelly
or something.

So, the man goes home and later that evening tries to get the second
suppository inserted, but he finds he cannot reach himself properly to
obtain the required depth.  Thus, he calls his wife over and tells her
what to do.  The wife nods, puts one hand on his shoulder to steady him
and with the other shoves the medicine home.  Suddenly the man screams
in disgust.  "What's the matter?" asked his wife.  "Did I hurt you?"

"No," replies the man, "but I just realized that when the doctor did
that, he had BOTH hands on my shoulders."
