From a local BBS: 
<P>
During Operation Desert Storm, Gen. Schwartzkopf was walking about in the 
Kuwaiti desert, and stumbled across something in the sand.  Uncovering it, he 
found an old lamp.  He took the lamp back to his tent and proceeded to polish it 
up, and (of course) out pops a Genie. 
<P>
The Genie thanked Schwartzkopf for 
releasing him from imprisonment, and told him that he would grant him any wish 
that he desired.  The General thought a moment and then unrolled a map of the 
Middle East onto his table.  He explained to the Genie about the wars that had 
been ravaging the entire area, and his one wish was for peace throughout the 
region.  The Genie responded that he and his ancestors had been working on that 
problem for several thousand years, had had no success, and now consider it 
hopeless.  He asked the General if there was another wish he could grant 
instead. 
<P>
Schwartzkopf thought for a moment and finally said that he wished 
that the Chicago Cubs could finally win a World Series.  The Genie pondered a 
moment and then said, "Why don't we take another look at that map?" 
<P>
