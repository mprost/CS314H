<PRE>A true story, from someone who was there at the time, circa 1980.

It seems that our favorite telephone company had a terrible problem:
employees were pilfering office supplies for their children. In par-
ticular, three-hole loose-leaf binder paper. It was decreed by the
powers that be that this sort of waste was unacceptable, and a long-
forgotten bureaucrat was assigned the task of discouraging theft of
three-hole paper. 

The bureaucrat's solution was simple: the company would now use *four*-
hole paper, with the holes drilled differently so as to be incompatible
with the typical school-child's binder. Four-hole loose-leaf paper was
ordered, along with proper four-ring binders; new manuals, documentation,
and other papers were likewise printed on four-hole paper, so all binders
and paper would be happy and consistent throughout the company. 

The result was, naturally, that employees stole both the binders <b>and</b>
the paper. 

Since the company was now suffering larger losses than before, it was
decreed that the they would return to traditional three-hole paper and
binders. But there was the problem of an existing large inventory of
four-ring binders. Hence, with truly Solomonic wisdom, it was further
decreed that all new paper would have <b>seven</b> holes, and would thus be
both upward and downward binder-compatible. And, to this day, 8+1/2 by
11 documents from our favorite telephone company still have 7 holes in
them. 

All of which nicely demonstrates that System V Release 1 and System V
Release 4 were not a fluke.

&lt;csg&gt;

[For the benefit of those not UNIX-literate: System V Release 1 ignored
BSD UNIX and really hoped it would go away. System V Release 4 wants to
be compatible with every UNIX in existence.]
