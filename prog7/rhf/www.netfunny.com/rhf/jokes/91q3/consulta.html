From Dick Reboulet, circa 1966: 
<P>
A prize bull and a prize cow got together and decided they'd have a little 
prize calf.  So they did.  When he was born, they decided he'd have the 
best of everything--food, education, ...  So they kept him in a little 
compound separated from the hoi polloi.  But as he reached puberty, he 
looked out through the chain-link fence at all the cows out there, and 
drooled.  He would back up to the far corner of his pen, and study the 
top of the barbed-wire topped fence.  He always concluded he couldn't 
make it.  But one day, he decided he was big and strong enough.  He backed 
up to the farthest corner, and ran like hell.  He jumped over the fence, 
and made it, almost.  Just then, papa bull came ambling along the fence 
line, noticed his son bleeding, noticed what was hanging on the barbed 
wire atop the fence, noticed his son bleeding ...  At last he consoled 
his son:  Don't worry, son, you can always be a consultant.
