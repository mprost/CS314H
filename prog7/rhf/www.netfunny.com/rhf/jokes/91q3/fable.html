This was written by Tom Annau, an undergrad working in my lab here 
at Stanford. 
<P>
Aesop's fables and other traditional children's stories involve 
allegory far too subtle for the youth of today.  Children need 
an updated message with contemporary circumstance and plot line, 
and short enough to suit today's minute attention span. 
<P>
<H4>The Troubled Aardvark</H4>
<P>
Once upon a time, there was an aardvark whose only pleasure in life 
was driving from his suburban bungalow to his job at a large brokerage 
house in his brand new 4x4.  He hated his manipulative boss, his 
conniving and unethical co-workers, his greedy wife, and his sniveling, 
spoiled children.  One day, the aardvark reflected on the meaning of 
his life and his career and on the unchecked, catastrophic decline of 
his nation, its pathetic excuse for leadership, and the complete 
ineffectiveness of any personal effort he could make to change the 
status quo.  Overcome by a wave of utter depression and self-doubt, 
he decided to take the only course of action that would bring 
him greater comfort and happiness: he drove to the mall and bought 
imported consumer electronics goods. 
<P>
MORAL OF THE STORY:  Invest in foreign consumer electronics 
manufacturers.
