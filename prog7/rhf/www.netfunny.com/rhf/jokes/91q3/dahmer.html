From: scott@ferrari.labs.tek.com

Why was Jeffrey Dahmer looking for a new apartment?

Because he needed more elbow room.

Subject: J. Dahmer joke not on your recent posting
From: hubler@galaxy.lerc.nasa.gov (Dale Hubler)


Here is on I heard from one of the local radio stations

The police asked Jeffrey Dahmer why he did it and he replied, "Well,
a sandwich is just a sandwich, but a manwich is a meal."

Subject: Two more Jeffrey Dahmer jokes
From: UNCPEW@unc.bitnet (Penny Ward)

These were printed in the Raleigh News &amp; Observer the week of
7/29/91:


Jeffrey Dahmer is renting out his old apartment.  The apartment
comes with roommates--some assembly required.

Subject: Body parts
From: lowendorf-henry@cs.yale.edu (Henry Lowendorf)

This is original:

Jeffrey Dahmer made the mistake of putting them into the refrigerator.

If he'd thrown them into a mass grave in the Iraqi desert, he'd be
a hero.

Subject: new name
From: bh18371@boson.sbi.com (Billy Hum)


Heard floating around the office:

Did you hear they renamed Milwaukee?

It's now called Hackensack

Subject: Dahmer and a praying mantis
From: esh@cblpe.att.com (Thomas D Esh)


This is original.


How are Jeffery Dahmer and a praying mantis alike?


They both eat their dates.

If Jeffrey Dalmer, the admitted killer and cannibal, is sentenced to
death it could create a very awkward position for the prison.  
After all, condemned prisoners are traditionally given the last meal of 
their choice.
