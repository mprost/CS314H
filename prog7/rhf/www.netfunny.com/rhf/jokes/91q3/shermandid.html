My brother's psychology professor, a Yankee's Yankee and a 
feminist's feminist, tells the following story on herself to illustrate 
that doctorates don't necessarily make you smart. 
<P>
She was driving to a workshop in Atlanta from her home in Ohio. 
It was about 10 am, and she'd been driving the entire preceding day and night 
herself, and she was consequently not in the best of tempers as she searched 
for a motel in which to crash. 
<P>
A Georgia state policeman pulled her over, got out of his cruiser, 
swaggered up to her driver's window, bent down, and drawled, "Lookie here, 
darlin',"--uh oh, everybody duck--"Lookie here, darlin', <B>nobody</B> blows 
through Georgia <B>that</B> fast." 
<P>
Said the feminist Yankee overtired psychology professor: "Sherman did." 
<P>
She says he was not satisfied merely to give her a speeding ticket; 
he made her follow him fifty miles out of her way to Nowheresburg, GA, and 
wait at the police station until three in the afternoon for a circuit judge 
to arrive so that he could explain to her why it wasn't the best idea in 
the world to be impolite to policemen, who were after all interested only 
in creating the safest possible environment for everybody including her, 
etc. etc.  The lecture went on for about two hours, she says, after which 
she was released to drive the fifty miles back to her route and resume her 
search for someplace to crash. 
<P>
True story--anyway, that's what my brother said.
