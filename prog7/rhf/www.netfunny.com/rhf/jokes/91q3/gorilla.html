Probably an old joke, but it was new to me: 
<P>
Sam and Susan were invited to a costume party.  Susan went out and rented 
costumes for the both of them.  However, when the time came for the party, 
Susan wasn't feeling well and Sam went on alone. 
<P>
A few hours later, Susan began to feel better and decided to go on to the 
party.  She realized that while she knew Sam was in a gorilla suit, he had 
never seen her costume, and decided to go and see what he got up to while 
he was alone. 
<P>
She arrived and observed him dancing closely with a series of beautiful 
women.  She approached him and began flirting, and soon they were taking 
a walk in the woods alone.  They then undressed in the darkness and had 
sex. 
<P>
She got home before her husband and when he arrived, she was in bed.  She 
asked him, "How was the party?" 
<P>
He replied "Oh, the usual - you know I 
never have much fun at these things alone." 
<P>
"Didn't you even dance?" she 
asked. 
<P>
"No, I sat in the den all night playing cards.  The guy I lent my 
costume to had a ball, though..." 
<P>
