original source : Pieter Kuiper from "The Pieper", Amsterdam.

A very joyfull but not too intelligent man is driving his wife and his
father-in-law across the Golden Gate Bridge, when he is stopped at the exit
by some police officers and the mayor of San Fransisco. He pulls over and
addresses the police officer coming up to his car :
-"What seems to be the problem, officer ?"
-"No problem at all, sir. You are the 5,000,000,000,000,000th passenger to
  cross the Golden Gate bridge, and therefore, on behalf of the mayor, I hereby
  present you with $ 5000 prize money !"
-"Gee, thanks officer"
-"And, sir, do you have any idea what you are gonna use this money for ?"
-"Yes, this finally enables me to pay for drivers ed and get a drivers licence "

His wife, shocked at the foolishness of this remark quickly turns to the officer
in an attempt to undo the damage :

-"Don't mind him, officer, he always talks gibberish when he is drunk"

All this has woken up the mans father-in-law, who at seeing the police officer
shouts to his son-in-law :

-"I told you sonny, you never get far in a stolen vehicle !"
