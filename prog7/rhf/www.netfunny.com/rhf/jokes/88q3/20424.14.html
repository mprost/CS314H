<P>
The IBM salesman and the IBM system analyst went to spend 
a weekend in the forest, hunting bear. 
<P>
They hired a log cabin, and when they got there, took 
their backpacks off and put them inside. 
<P>
At which point the salesman said to the systems analyst: 
"You unpack while I go and find us a bear." 
<P>
The analyst finished unpacking and then went and sat 
outside to await events. He did not have to wait too long. 
<P>
Soon he could hear noises in the forest. The noises got 
nearer - and suddenly there was the salesman, running 
across the clearing toward the cabin, pursued by one of the 
largest and most ferocious Brown Bears the analyst had 
ever seen. 
<P>
"Open the door!" shouted the salesman. 
The analyst opened the door. 
The salesman ran to the door, suddenly stopped, and 
stepped aside. 
<P>
The Bear carried by its momentum, continued though the 
door and disappeared inside. 
<P>
The salesman promptly shut the door on it, turned, looked 
at the analyst, and said: 
<P>
"Ok, you skin that one while I go rustle us up another."
