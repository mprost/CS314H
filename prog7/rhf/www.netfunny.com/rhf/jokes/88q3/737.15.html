<H4>New Programmer's Editor for the Amiga</H4>
<P>
Hot on the heels of Apple Computer's release of HyperCard is a new concept 
in interactive text editors from Obscure Technologies Inc., named PunchEd. 
For those wondering what HyperCard is, it's a new `metaphor' in human-computer 
interaction, in which data, be they text, music or pictures, are represented 
by a hierarchy of `index cards' which the user can activate or browse through 
by using mouse-sensitive gadgets.  Obscure Technologies has, as their promo- 
tional literature states, contracted (not expanded) on the HyperCard idea in 
their new programmer's editor, PunchEd.   In PunchEd, the visual metaphor 
presented to the user is that of a stack of punched paper cards, just like 
those used extensively in the computer industry since the 1950s and with which 
the company believes real programmers will feel more comfortable than with 
full-screen text editors. 
<P>
The cards can be viewed on the screen individually, or several can be 
viewed spread out simultaneously (a process referred to as `fanning').  Like 
HyperCard, PunchEd allows the user to browse, or `riffle', through his or her 
`stack' of cards using the mouse.  Users must exercise some caution when 
riffling, since there is a chance that they could experience a `stack drop', 
where the carefully-arranged cards become hopelessly jumbled.  This reviewer 
somehow managed to perform a stack drop, an operation only slightly less 
frustrating than getting a stack overflow.  Fortunately, PunchEd provides 
a `shuffle' command for getting things back in order again. There is also a 
facility whereby a previously entered card can be duplicated with a single 
keystroke - quite a time-saver.  Other basic editor features, such as entering 
text, are also provided.  One small problem, however, is that there is no 
backspacing capability, so in order to correct your text, you must retype the 
offending line onto a new card and remove the old one.  Some users will, I'm 
sure, appreciate this attention to detail. 
<P>
The feature of PunchEd that will probably make it a big success in the 
eyes of programmers is that command text can be included in the same file as 
the source code.  Goodbye, Make!  With the inclusion of a few simple cards at 
the beginning of your file you can specify all the processing control you 
need.  For example, to compile and link your C program, just include the 
following: 
<P>

{ 
	printf("hello, worldn");
