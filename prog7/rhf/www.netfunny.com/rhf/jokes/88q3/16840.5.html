Little Martin is four years old.  One day while he was pestering his 
mother, she said, "Why don't you go across the street and watch the 
builders work, maybe you will learn something." 
<P>
Martin was gone about two hours.  When he came home, his mother asked 
him what he had learned.  Martin replied - "Well first you put the 
goddamn door up.  Then the son of a bitch doesn't fit so you have to 
take the cock sucker down.  Then you have to shave a cunt hair off each 
side and put the mother fucker back up." 
<P>
Martin's mother said, "Wait until your father gets home." 
<P>
When Martin's father got home, Martin's mum told him to ask Martin what 
he had learnt today.  When Martin told him the whole story, dad said, 
"Martin, go outside and get me a switch."  Martin replied, "Get fucked. 
That's the electrician's job."
