So there's this magician working on a small cruise ship. He's been doing his 
routines every night for a year or two now. The audiences appreciate him, and 
they change over often enough that he doesn't have to worry too much about 
new tricks. However, there's this parrot who sits in the back row and watches 
him night after night, year after year. Finally, the parrot figures out how 
the tricks work and starts giving it away for the audience. For example, when 
the magician makes a bouquet of flowers disappear, the parrot squawks "Behind 
his back! Behind his back!" Well, the magician get really annoyed at this, 
but he doesn't know what to do. The parrot belongs to the Captain, so he 
can't just kill it. 
<P>
One day, the ship springs a leak and sinks. The magician manages to swim to a 
plank of wood floating by and grabs on. The parrot is sitting on the other 
end of the plank. The just stare at each other and drift. They drift for 3 
days and still don't speak. On the morning of the fourth day, the parrot 
looks over at the magician and says: "OK, I give up. Where did you hide the 
ship?"
