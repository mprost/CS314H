Editors Note: 
<P>
Here it is folks, the oneliner file.  Over the past year, I have 
received several short submissions that were mildly funny, but 
not quite good enough or topical enough to merit their own posting. 
I have collected them all for you, and it's time to flush the 
buffer.  These vary in quality quite a bit, and are not rated. 
<P>
Please don't take this as an invitation to send me your own 
favourite one liners.  There are thousands of these things in 
the world, and I don't have time to sift through them except on 
an infrequent basis.  Remember, one joke per submission. 
<P>
My advice is to read this file slowly if you can, one joke at a 
time.  Oneliner jokes are often ruined if read together in 
a bunch.
