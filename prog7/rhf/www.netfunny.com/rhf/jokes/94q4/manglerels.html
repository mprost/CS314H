"MANGLING IMPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS"<BR>
</center>
<P>
Copious research has conclusively shown that there are exactly 
two dimensions to human personality:  self-control and evangelism. 
<P>
<H4>THE SELF-CONTROL SCALE</H4>
<P>
The self-control scale denotes the degree to which a person maintains 
control of his or her emotions.  Humans are evenly distributed along 
this scale with Spock at one end (although he is really half Vulcan) and 
Sally Field at the other (see Figure 1). 
<P>
<PRE>                    Figure 1.  Self-Control Scale 
<P>
                             Self-Control 
              +---------------------------------------+ 
              |                                       | 
            Spock                                Sally Field

        emotion whatsoever, unless           emotion.  Cries when 
        under the influence of mind-         reading "The Family Circus" 
        altering drugs, such as pod          or when nominated for an 
        spray.                               Oscar. 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
<H4>THE EVANGELISM SCALE</H4>
<P>
The evangelism scale denotes the degree to which a person forces his 
or her opinions and beliefs on others.  Like the self-control scale, 
humans are evenly distributed on this scale, with Supreme Court 
nominees on one end and Jimmy Swaggert at the other (see Figure 2). 
<P>

        even be extricated                   and without provocation, 
        through Senate judicial              often frothing at the 
        hearings.                            mouth and sweating 
                                             profusely. 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
<H4>WHERE ARE YOU ON THE SCALES?</H4>
<P>
Where each person falls on the self-control and evangelism scales is 
genetically predetermined and can be calculated from a questionnaire of 
20 or so questions that you give to five of your friends/coworkers. 
This questionnaire was scientifically engineered and is backed up by 
copious research, so regardless of who answers this questionnaire 
(convenience store clerks, your mother, your worst enemies), your 
location on the scales is always the same.  Oh, there have been some 
exceptions, but they were due to people getting confused when filling in 
the dots on the questionnaire. 
<P>
<H4>THE PERSONALITY QUADRANTS</H4>
<P>
Copious research has shown that there are four quadrants in which we 
can stereotype human personalities (see Figure 3).  This graph is 
derived from the two personality scales, with Evangelism as the X axis 
and Self-Control as the Y axis.

Once your location on the scales is determined, we can plot your 
personality on a graph and pigeon-hole you for life!  For example, if 
your questionnaire shows 1 on the Self-Control scale and 1 on the 
Evangelism scale, you would be classified as an Anal-Retentive, and 
are probably enjoying these numbers immensely.  If you scored 19 on 
Self-Control and 19 on Evangelism, you are a Psychotic and are 
probably throwing a tantrum at this moment.  Of course, there is no 
value judgement placed on any location in the quadrant:  It's OK to be 
a Spineless Wimp; it's OK to by Psychotic; it's OK to be where-ever 
you are (although YOUR location is rather abnormal). 
<P>
By definition, the personality type of a particular quadrant hates the 
personality type in the opposite quadrant.  So, ARs hate Psychotics and 
vice versa; likewise for SWs and Megalomaniacs.  Understanding the hatred 
between these groups is the first step to building good teamwork!

<H4>THE FLEXIBILITY SCALE</H4>
<P>
In addition to the four quadrants, there is another dimension to 
personality (even though I said there were only two before).  This other 
dimension is flexibility, also known as schizophrenia.  This scale 
denotes how well can a person fake another personality type (see Figure 4). 
<P>
<PRE>                        Figure 4. The Flexibility Scale 
<P>

 personality.                 personality.                       ity.  Can 
                                                                 fake all four 
                                                                 personality 
                                                                 types. 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
Although we can never change our basic location in the personality 
quadrants, we can strive for and achieve greater flexibility!  For 
example, you may be merely paranoid now, but with a little work in this 
course, you could become a split personality or even quadrophenic!  The 
key to flexibility is understanding the other personality types so that 
you can quickly and easily pigeon-hole those around you and understand 
what makes them tick.  Once you know how to do this, you will find that 
it is much easier to manipulate those around you! 
<P>
<H4>SUMMARY</H4>
<P>
You now know everything you need to better mangle impersonal 
relationships.  Good luck!  And remember: It's much easier to work 
with people once you've stereotyped them.
