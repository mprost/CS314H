[This is original.  I made it up myself.] 
<P>
General Motors doesn't have a help line for people who don't know how 
to drive.  Imagine if they did ... 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<BR><B>HelpLine:</B> "General Motors HelpLine, how can I help you?"<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> "I got in my car and closed the door and nothing happened!"<BR>
<B>HelpLine:</B> "Did you put the key in the ignition slot and turn it?"<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> "What's an ignition?"<BR>
<B>HelpLine:</B> "It's a starter motor that draws current from your battery<BR>
and turns over the engine."<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> "Ignition?  Motor?  Battery?  Engine?  How come I have to<BR>
know all these technical terms just to use my car?"<BR>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>HelpLine:</B> "General Motors HelpLine, how can I help you?"<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> "My car ran fine for a week and now it won't go anywhere!"<BR>
<B>HelpLine:</B> "Is the gas tank empty?"<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> "Huh?  How do I know?"<BR>
<B>HelpLine:</B> "There's a little gauge on the front panel with a needle and<BR>
markings from 'E' to 'F'.  Where is the needle pointing?"<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> "It's pointing to 'E'.  What does that mean?"<BR>
<B>HelpLine:</B> "It means you have to visit a gasoline vendor and purchase<BR>
some more gasoline.  You can install it yourself or pay the<BR>
vendor to install it for you."<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> "What?  I paid $12,000 for this car!  Now you tell me that I<BR>
have to keep buying more components?  I want a car that comes<BR>
with everything built in!"<BR>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>HelpLine:</B> "General Motors HelpLine, how can I help you?"<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> "Your cars suck!"<BR>
<B>HelpLine:</B> "What's wrong?"<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> "It crashed, that's what wrong!"<BR>
<B>HelpLine:</B> "What were you doing?"<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> "I wanted to run faster, so I pushed the accelerator pedal all the<BR>
way to the floor.  It worked for a while and then it crashed and<BR>
it won't start now!<BR>
<B>HelpLine:</B> "It's your responsibility if you misuse the product.  What do you<BR>
expect us to do about it?"<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> "I want you to send me one of the latest version that doesn't<BR>
crash any more!"<BR>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>HelpLine:</B> "General Motors HelpLine, how can I help you?"<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> "Hi, I just bought my first car, and I chose your car because it<BR>
has automatic transmission, cruise control, power steering,<BR>
power brakes, and power door locks."<BR>
<B>HelpLine:</B> "Thanks for buying our car.  How can I help you?"<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> "How do I work it?"<BR>
<B>HelpLine:</B> "Do you know how to drive?"<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> "Do I know how to what?"<BR>
<B>HelpLine:</B> "Do you know how to drive?"<BR>
<B>Customer:</B> "I'm not a technical person.  I just want to go places in my car!"<BR>
