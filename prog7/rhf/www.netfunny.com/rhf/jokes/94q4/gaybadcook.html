I heard this story from a Unitarian minister, who swore up and 
down that it was true.  The young man in question is one of his 
parishoners. 
<P>
A young man, in the course of his college life, came to terms 
with his homosexuality and decided to "come out of the closet."  His plan 
was to tell his mother first; so on his next home visit, he went to the 
kitchen, where his mother was busying herself stirring stew with a wooden 
spoon.  Rather nervously, he explained to her that he had realized he 
was gay. 
<P>
Without looking up from her stew, his mother said, "You mean, 
homosexual?" 
<P>
"Well...yes." 
<P>
Still without looking up: "Does that mean you suck men's penises?" 
<P>
Caught off guard, the young man eventually managed to stammer an 
embarrassed affirmative; whereupon his mother turned to him and, 
brandishing the wooden spoon threateningly under his nose, snapped: 
<P>
"Don't you <B>EVER</B> complain about my cooking again!" 
<P>
