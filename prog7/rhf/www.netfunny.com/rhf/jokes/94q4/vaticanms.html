MICROSOFT Bids to Acquire Catholic Church<BR>
By Hank Vorjes<BR>
</center>
<P>
VATICAN CITY (AP)--In a joint press conference in St. Peter's Square 
this morning, MICROSOFT Corp. and the Vatican announced that the 
Redmond software giant will acquire the Roman Catholic Church in 
exchange for an unspecified number of shares of MICROSOFT common stock. 
If the deal goes through, it will be the first time a computer software 
company has acquired a major world religion. 
<P>
With the acquisition, Pope John Paul II will become the senior 
vice-president of the combined company's new Religious Software 
Division, while MICROSOFT senior vice-presidents Michael Maples and 
Steven Ballmer will be invested in the College of Cardinals, said 
MICROSOFT Chairman Bill Gates. 
<P>
"We expect a lot of growth in the religious market in the next five to 
ten years," said Gates. "The combined resources of MICROSOFT and the 
Catholic Church will allow us to make religion easier and more fun for 
a broader range of people." 
<P>
Through the MICROSOFT Network, the company's new on-line service, "we 
will make the sacraments available on-line for the first time" and 
revive the popular pre-Counter-Reformation practice of selling 
indulgences, said Gates. "You can get Communion, confess your sins, 
receive absolution--even reduce your time in Purgatory--all without 
leaving your home." 
<P>
A new software application, MICROSOFT Church, will include a macro 
language which you can program to download heavenly graces 
automatically while you are away from your computer. 
<P>
An estimated 17,000 people attended the announcement in St Peter's 
Square, watching on a 60-foot screen as comedian Don Novello--in 
character as Father Guido Sarducci--hosted the event, which was 
broadcast by satellite to 700 sites worldwide. 
<P>
Pope John Paul II said little during the announcement. When Novello 
chided Gates, "Now I guess you get to wear one of these pointy hats," 
the crowd roared, but the pontiff's smile seemed strained. 
<P>
The deal grants MICROSOFT exclusive electronic rights to the Bible and 
the Vatican's prized art collection, which includes works by such 
masters as Michelangelo and Da Vinci. But critics say MICROSOFT will 
face stiff challenges if it attempts to limit competitors' access to 
these key intellectual properties. 
<P>
"The Jewish people invented the look and feel of the holy scriptures," 
said Rabbi David Gottschalk of Philadelphia. "You take the parting of 
the Red Sea--we had that thousands of years before the Catholics came 
on the scene." 
<P>
But others argue that the Catholic and Jewish faiths both draw on a 
common Abrahamic heritage. "The Catholic Church has just been more 
successful in marketing it to a larger audience," notes Notre Dame 
theologian Father Kenneth Madigan. Over the last 2,000 years, the 
Catholic Church's market share has increased dramatically, while 
Judaism, which was the first to offer many of the concepts now touted 
by Christianity, lags behind. 
<P>
Historically, the Church has a reputation as an aggressive competitor, 
leading crusades to pressure people to upgrade to Catholicism, and 
entering into exclusive licensing arrangements in various kingdoms 
whereby all subjects were instilled with Catholicism, whether or not 
they planned to use it. Today Christianity is available from several 
denominations, but the Catholic version is still the most widely used. 
The Church's mission is to reach "the four corners of the earth," 
echoing MICROSOFT's vision of "a computer on every desktop and in every 
home." 
<P>
Gates described MICROSOFT's long-term strategy to develop a scalable 
religious architecture that will support all religions through 
emulation. A single core religion will be offered with a choice of 
interfaces according to the religion desired--"One religion, a couple 
of different implementations," said Gates. 
<P>
The MICROSOFT move could spark a wave of mergers and acquisitions, 
according to Herb Peters, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Baptist 
Conference, as other churches scramble to strengthen their position in 
the increasingly competitive religious market.
