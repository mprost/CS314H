<PRE>A Postal Commision's stamp design, of a atmoic bomb mushroom clous,
has been cancelled by President Clinton.  No one is acknowledging
this continuing streak of violence by postal workers, either.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: New stamp?
From: TMCX74A@prodigy.com (MR GEORGE E DOSCHER)

The US Postal Service, bowing to pressure from many sides,
including the Japanese and the White House, have dropped
plans for a new stamp commemorating the dropping of the
A-Bomb on Japan to end WWII.

The Postal Service has announced their next stamp: an
artist's rendition of former President George Bush vomiting 
on the Japanese ambassador.

(From "The Bearman &amp; Keith" radio show on WZZO in Allentown, 
PA)

Subject: No atom bomb stamp
From: barrsx@turing.uncg.edu (Steve Barr)
Keywords: original


The post office will instead be producing two other stamps:
"Rape of Nanking shows Japanese superiority"
and
"Comfort women ease soldiers' burden."

Subject: Other US Stamps Being Cancelled

This is original work.


The US Postal Service has recently decided not to issue
a stamp commemorating the dropping of the Atomic Bomb
on Japan during World War II.  The Post Office was
surprised by the outcry over this stamp, but has learned
from its mistake.  The following is a list of other
planned stamps that are being abandoned.

    A stamp commemorating the assassination of
    President Lincoln.  It depicted John Wilkes Booth's
    dramatic leap to the stage of Ford's theatre, and 
    carried the caption "Sic Temper Tyrannis."  Lincoln
    could be seen slumping in his box.

    A series of stamps with famous serial killers.  This
    project was in jeopardy anyway, because Post Office
    policy is not to put living Americans on stamps, and
    what would a serial killer series be without Charles
    Manson?

    A stamp in honor of the extinction of the Mohicans,
    picturing a Mohawk, 'cause they have cooler haircuts.

    The Personal Hygiene series, which would have
    depicted the evolution of important-but-often-under-
    appreciated inventions such as deodorant and
    hair spray.

    A Stamp commemorating the decision by the framers
    of the US Constitution to count black slaves as
    3/5's of a human being.

    A stamp showing Three Mile Island, with the caption
    "Meltdown Free since 83."

    A Series called Bad Moments in American Military 
    History, to include "Valley Forge," "Picket's Charge," 
    "Pearl Harbor," "The Bataan Death March," and "The Tet 
    Offensive."

    The "Commonly Seen Roadkill" limited series
    was to have warned motorists of animals that
    may haplessly jump out in front of them.

    A stamp called the "Poor little rich county,"
    originally targeted as a fundraiser for Orange County, CA.

    Other geographically educational stamps on
    the drawing board included: "Cleveland - The
    Mistake by the Lake," "Staten Island - NYC's
    Garbage Dump," "Detroit - Don't go out at Night,"
    and "The NJ Meadowlands, Graveyard of Organized
    Crime."
