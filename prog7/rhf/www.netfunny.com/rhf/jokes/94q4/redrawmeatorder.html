Dear Jodi, 
<P>
Thank you for arranging this luncheon for Sharon. I'm deciding what 
to order, and I have a question. 
<P>
What about us carnivores?  I want meat. Red raw meat. I want them 
to lead it in on a rope and I want it to "moo" when I bite into it. I 
don't want anybody I know to see me eating "rice pilaf" or  "chicken 
Fresco."  In fact I don't want anybody who knows anybody I know to 
see me doing so. I want a dignified American meal of steak and 
potatoes by God, served with flagons of blood-red wine. I want 
Hungarian red wine, with a picture of a cow on the label.  I want to 
think about Eastern Europeans making this wine for slave wages and 
making it badly. I want the whole bottle. I want several.  I want it 
served on a white tablecloth and I want that tablecloth to be so 
soiled when we're done that it can't even be used for rags.  I want a 
meal to remember, in the midst of bawdy company. I want someone 
to tell off-color jokes and I want us all to laugh till we cry.  I want 
some of us to discover that the person we've mumbled at as we've 
passed in the halls these last 5 years is a sexual rogue. I want several 
people to fail to return to work afterward. I want to see a 
disciplinary memo sent down from the director's office in the wake 
of all this. I want the restaurant to refuse to serve anyone from the 
Lab for the next two years. I want to generate gossip. I want media 
coverage. I want arrests. I want some careers to be launched and 
others destroyed. I want this luncheon to divide time into a before 
and an after.  Despite her acute embarrassment at all this, I want 
Sharon to change her mind and stay. 
<P>
That's what I REALLY want.  I just KNOW you're going to tell me I 
can't have it.  So I'll get back to you with my food order. 
<P>
