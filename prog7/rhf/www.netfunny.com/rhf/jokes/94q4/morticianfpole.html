<PRE>
Heard this one about 20 years ago, but I still get a chuckle out of it.
Haven't seen it on rhf, but I haven't read it much in the last couple of
years.

There were three morticians trading stories in a bar one night.  The first
one says, "What a day I had today.  The guy wasn't wearing his seatbelt and
his head flew into the windshield.  Took me all day to make the face look
natural."

Not to be outdone, the second mortician says, "You think that's bad?  I had
this kid in who got hit by a train while he was riding his bike.  Took me TWO
days to put all the pieces back together!"

The third mortician just shook his head.  "You guys have it easy," he said.
"I had this female parachutist whose chute didn't open.  She landed on a
flagpole and it took me all week just to wipe the smile off her face!"
