The couple are merrily banging away, going ten to the dozen then she hears 
the sound of a car door slam shut. 
<P>
"Oh shit" cries out the woman, "It's my husband coming home early." 
The man mutters "Holy Shit" under his breath, panicking about his 
prediciment. 
"Quickly" the woman replies as she gathers up his clothes. "Take these and hide 
in the closet until the coast is clear." 
He picks up the offered garments and steals away to the large closet. He closes 
the door and crouches down. 
<P>
After a while he gets the sneaking feeling that he's not entirly alone. 
"Dark in here, isn't it." The young boys voice confirms it. The womans son must 
have been hiding here during the whole sordid act. 
"Holy Shit" the man mutters again. "Listen sonny. If I give you ten pounds 
will you keep all this to yourself and not tell anyone. 
The young lad thinks for a minute before saying "Tell you what, make it a fiver 
and you've got a deal. (Evidentally the lads state education wasn't totally 
wasted...). 
<P>
The man hunts around for his wallet and pulls out some money, using the light 
beaming through the keyhole to deduce it's demonination. The boy quickly takes 
the money and tells the man that his secret is safe. He breaths a sigh of 
relief and eventually manages to escape. 
<P>
The next day at breakfast the young lad pulls out the fiver from his pocket and 
starts to work out what he can buy with it. 
<P>
"What's that?" his father demands. "A five pound note? Where did you get it 
from? Did you steal it?" 
<P>
"No. I earned it" the boy wails. 
<P>
"A likely story. You stole it didn't you?" 
<P>
The father rises from his chair and removes the money from the boys' hands. 
"Go to confession this instant and pray for your forgivness, you thief." 
<P>
The boy relucantly trudges off to the local Church, walks in and walks up to 
the confessional. Once at the door he pushes it open and finding it vacant, he 
walks in, closes the door and sits down. 
<P>
"Oh, dark in here isn't it" the boy whispers. 
<P>
A voice from the other side calls out : "Holy Shit, not you again" 
<P>
