<PRE>     In heaven, there are two gates for married men:  The gate for married 
     men that say that they are the boss, and; the gate for married men who 
     admit that their wife is the boss.
     
     Saint Peter was strolling near the two gates one afternoon.  In front 
     of the gate for married men who admit that their wife is the boss, was 
     a big long line.  In front of the gate for men who say the they are 
     the boss was one fellow, standing all by himself.
     
     "Say Buddy, what are you doing over by THAT gate?" inquired Saint 
     Peter.
     
     "Well, Saint Peter, I'm really not sure," replied the man "but this is 
     where my wife told me to stand."
