</PRE>we know exactly what we need to pick up at Ikea... so we will not, I refuse 
to be, there more than 20 minutes... so yes... dinner sounds doable...

<P>
</PRE>A 20 minute Ikea run?  Is such a thing possible?   I'm skeptical.  This 
would turn the whole shopping community upside-down. 
<P>
Not to be confused with the OSH Certain Uncertainty factor, where OSH is 
guaranteed to be out of stock of at least one item on your list, so if you 
go there looking for one thing you'll come away empty-handed. 
<P>
In Ikea's case, breaking the 20-minute barrier appears possible if you 
overlook the Ikea Moron-Density (IMD) factor.  Now, the IMD is an average, 
and there certainly are concentrations of higher and lower IMD throughout 
the store.  Success depends on interacting with as few people as possible, 
though it should be noted that this merely increases the variance (V) and 
puts you at the mercy of the specific IMD of the areas where you have to 
interact. 
<P>
If you know exactly where your item is, are quick on your feet, and manage 
to avoid floor staff interaction entirely, you could reduce your 
interactions to just the checkout area. 
<P>
Suprisingly, the general floor staff's very low coefficient of Helpfulness 
(cH) may actually work in your favor.  Normally, attempting to interact with 
floor staff would leave you more confused than when you started, because of 
the low cH.  But since customer avoidance seems to go hand-in-hand with low 
cH, this may result in you being able to eliminate the effect of the IMD of 
the floor area. 
<P>
Thus limiting your IMD exposure to just the checkout area.  But here's where 
nature pulls its dirty trick.  You inevitably must factor in two IMD figures 
-- staff Moron Density (sMD) and customer Moron Density (cMD).  This can 
often be minimized by choosing the shortest line--but again this merely 
reduces the variance (V) and does not guarantee you won't be stuck behind 
someone who left their brain in their sunday pants. 
<P>
A word of warning:  If you have to deal with Customer Service, where the 
time-dilation approaches Andrea's Constant (a) and cH approaches 
singularity, then IMD can effectively no longer be treated as an average but 
must be assumed at 1.00, then, well let's just say "bring a sandwich."
