Spanish varies from country to country somewhat more than English 
does.  For example, the plural familiar form ("vosotros") is very 
common in Spain and virtually non-existent anywhere else.  Another verb 
form, "vos," is more obscure; it's used a lot in Argentina, and less so 
in Chile and parts of Central America (especially among the rural, 
poorer classes).  Other places it's unknown.  Many Spanish 
instructional textbooks don't even mention the "vos" form, and those 
that do, do so only in passing. 
<P>
("Vos" is chiefly known to the Spanish-speaking world from Argentinian 
soap operas and the immensely popular Argentinian comic strip 
"Mafalda.") 
<P>
"Vos" is an alternate form of the well-known singular familar "tu." 
Structurally, it's pretty similar to "tu"; the chief difference being 
in accent and in the fact that verbs don't change their stems, as they 
do with "tu" and other persons. 
<P>
For example, to say "you think" (the verb "pensar"): 
<P>
<PRE>tu:     Tu piensas     [too pee-EN-sahs] 
vos:    Vos pensas     [vos pen-SAHS] 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
Or, similarly, the command "sit down" (the verb "sentar"): 
<P>
<PRE>tu:     Sientate       [see-EN-tah-tay] 
vos:    Sentate        [sen-TAH-tay] 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
Now, the verb "colgar" means "to hang."  Granted, you're unlikely to do 
so, but if you wanted to say "hang yourself" you'd do it like this: 
<P>
<PRE>tu:     Cuelgate       [kWEL-gah-tay] 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
But in "vos," it's: 
<P>
<PRE>vos:    Colgate        [col-GAH-tay] 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
Three guesses as to what the best-selling toothpaste in Latin America 
is.  Hint:  it's not Crest.

<P>
P.S.  To avoid flames (though it cheapens the story somewhat), I should 
point out that "colgar" means to hang an object; the verb "to hang" in 
the "Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" sense is "ahorcar."  However, once 
in a while even native speakers will use the wrong verb--just as native 
English speakers will use "hung" when they mean "hanged."  (The latter 
is correct for hanging people.)
