<PRE>
Another in a series of letters that I have written after being rejected
by a magazine yet again (although they still think I'll want to
subscribe to their magazine after they've rejected me):

Dear Mr. Doe,

Thank you very much for your rejection letter and promotional offer.  I
regret to say that I have no need for additional magazine subscriptions
at this time.  Thank you for your interest.

I would like to request that you not send me any additional promotional
information.  While I understand that the idea behind your magazine is
to make money, I'm sure <b>you</b> understand that the message you are
sending is, "No, your work isn't good enough for us, but your <b>money</b>
certainly is." This is an extremely irritating attitude, and not
constructive in the least.  Indeed, it has been the case in the past
where not only was I rejected, but the volume of promotional material
included with my manuscript was such that it increased the postage on my
SASE, and I was forced to pay the postage due. I am sure that you can
see that this is u acceptable.

Please pardon the form letter, but I receive so many rejection letters
that I am sure you understand that I simply don't have the time to
answer them all personally.

Once again, thanks for your interest.  I look forward to being rejected
by you again.

Sincerely,

Douglas Moran
