Have to write a letter of recommendation for that fired employee?
Here are a few suggested phrases:

For the Chronically Absent:
        "A man like him is hard to find"
        "It seemed her career was just taking off"

For the office drunk:
        "I feel his real talent is wasted here"
        "We generally found him loaded with work to do"

For an employee with no ambition
        "He could not care less about the number of hours he had
         to put in"

A stupid employee:
        "There is nothing you can teach a man like him"

A dishonest employee:
        "Her true ability was deceiving"
        "He's an unbelieveable worker"
