My father works with radioactive isotopes, and from time to time he
is called upon to inspect the labs in which they are used.  He
reports that there is a sign in one of the labs (near a rather nasty-
looking contraption), which reads:

    WARNING:  DO NOT LOOK INTO LASER WITH REMAINING EYE.

I guess that's fair warning.  Late, maybe--but fair.
