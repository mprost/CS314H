FUN WITH ANIMALS!!! 
<P>
Here are a few games that you can play with animals.  Some are quite simple to 
play and need only common household objects and easily found living creatures. 
Others are more complicated and are suggested for those of adventurous spirit. 
The games are for one player, except where indicated.  Enjoy!!
