Since the election season in the United States has passed I have 
one more thing that may amuse the good people of the Net. 
<P>
This is all taken directly from the State of Oregon voter's 
pamphlet. 
<P>
In Oregon, as in several states, we have what is called an 
initiative process.  This allows anyone who can collect enough 
signatures on petitions to put anything they want up for a public 
vote.  The first part is the measure itself. 
<P>
The second part is one of the arguments in favor.  You can have one 
of these put in the voter's pamphlet for $300. 
<P>
This measure failed by only a 10% margin. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H4>Measure No. 9, State of Oregon</H4>
<P>
<H4>BALLOT TITLE</H4>
<P>
<H4>AMENDS CONSTITUTION: GOVERNMENT CANNOT FACILITATE, MUST DISCOURAGE HOMOSEXUALITY, OTHER "BEHAVIORS"</H4>
<P>
QUESTION-Shall constitution be amended to require that all 
governments discourage homosexuality, other listed "behaviors," and 
not facilitate or recognize them? 
<P>
SUMMARY-Amends Oregon Constitution.  All governments in Oregon may 
not use their monies or properties to promote, encourage or 
facilitate homosexuality, pedophilia, sadism, or masochism.  All 
levels of government, including public education system, must 
assist in setting a standard for Oregon's youth which recognizes 
that these "behaviors" are "abnormal, wrong, unnatural and 
perverse" and that they are to be discouraged and avoided.  State 
may not recognize this conduct under "sexual orientation" or 
"sexual preference" labels, or through "quotas, minority status, 
affirmative action, or similar concepts." 
<P>
ESTIMATE OF FINANCIAL IMPACT-Minimal financial impact.  The 
Department of Education expects to make some in curriculum changes 
valued at $210,000 Federal Funds if this measure passes. 
<P>
<H4>ARGUMENT IN FAVOR</H4>
<P>
According to the book of Leviticus in the Bible, Oyster eating, 
crossbreeding cattle, shaving a beard, wearing clothes made of 
mixed fibers, cursing one's parents and adultery are just as 
immoral as homosexuality.  If the OCA's "No Special Rights" 
Committee wants to take one of the 3,000-year old laws of ritual 
holiness from Leviticus and put it into the Bill of Rights in the 
state constitution, they should be sincere enough to put all the 
rest of Leviticus into the constitution as well.  It's simple 
matter of respect for these historic laws to treat them 
consistently. 
<P>
We at the Special Righteousness Committee are just as offended 
by oyster eating, shaving and mixed fibers as the OCA is offended 
by homosexuality, and we have just as much right as the OCA does to 
change the state constitution to require government discrimination 
against people whose behavior we don't like. 
<P>
My friends, do you want the public schools teaching your 
children that shaving is a legitimate and equal alternative style 
to a normal healthy beard?  Would you want to be forced to hire an 
oyster-eater to direct your church choir?  Adam and Eve wore fig 
leaves--100 percent fig leaves--and this is divine proof that those 
disgustingly unnatural cotton/polyester blends are sinful.  And 
when the OCA was analyzing the threat to traditional family values, 
we don't know how they managed to overlook adultery!  Why there's 
a lot more adultery than homosexuality going on out there, and 
extrapolations from the OCA statistics show that 90 percent of the 
people who have engaged in sexual perversions are heterosexual 
("straight"). 
<P>
The state condones adultery by not punishing it by death as 
required by Leviticus.  It promotes oyster-eating by licensing 
seafood restaurants, it allows people to take mixed fibers out in 
public without being fired or evicted!  The state is encouraging 
sin! 
<P>
If the OCA can have the special right to make their personal 
moral agenda into public policy, then anyone else also should be 
able to amend the state Bill of Rights to eliminate basic rights 
for people who they don't like. 
<P>
Let's put ALL of Leviticus into the constitution!  A "yes" vote 
is the first step in facilitating our militant moral agenda. 
<P>
AGREE WITH US OR BURN IN HELL! 
<P>
