<PRE>Was cleaning out my briefcase and came across this beaut I picked up off the
ground a year (or so) ago when my desk was directly next to American Airlines
baggage service office.  I agologize in advance for the formatting (speaking
to the "grammatically correct"  \}B) but when it was edited with lower-case,
correct spelling and such it seemed to lose some of the comic impact these
poor agents were enduring as this unfolded...
