Harry was delighted when he found a young woman who accepted his 
proposal of marriage as he was sensitive about his wooden leg and a bit afraid 
no one would have him. In fact, he couldn't bring himself to tell his 
fiancee' about his leg when he slipped the ring on her finger, nor when she 
bought the dress, nor when they picked the time and place. All he kept saying 
was, "Darling, I've got a big surprise for you," at which she blushed and 
smiled bewitchingly. 
<P>
The wedding night came and went, and the young couple were at last 
alone in their hotel room. "Now don't forget, Harry, you promised me a big 
surprise," said the bride. 
<P>
Unable to say a word, Harry turned out the lights, unstrapped his 
wooden leg, slipped into bed, and placed his wife's hand on the stump. 
<P>
"Hmmmmm," she said softly, "that IS a surprise. But pass me the 
Vaseline and I'll see what I can do!" 
<P>

This couple is lying in bed one morning, and she takes it in mind to 
tell him the dream she had the night before. "Honey, I dreamed I was at a 
cock auction: there were extra-large cocks going for $90 or so, medium-size 
cocks selling for $50, and itty-bitty ones for $1.50." 
<P>
"Say, was mine in the auction?" the man inquires a bit anxiously. 
<P>
"Honey, yours would've been too big to get in the door." 
<P>
A couple of days later they're lying in bed again, and the man says, 
"You wouldn't believe what I dreamed last night: that I was at a pussy auction. 
There were great big ones, and little hairy ones, oh, all kinds." 
<P>
"Well, did you see mine?" she asks. 
<P>
"Baby," he says, "the auction was IN your pussy!"
