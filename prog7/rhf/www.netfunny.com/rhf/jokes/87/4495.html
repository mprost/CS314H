Since postings on the net 
tend to be repetititititive, why not number the various types?  This 
would save us all a lot of time reading the news, and would vastly 
decrease the time and cost of transmitting all the junk on the net. 
<P>
To get started, here are my suggestions for some of the groups I read. 
Please feel free to add others. 
<P>
Note:  Since some postings DO include a tiny amount of variable 
information, I have allowed for this by the use of &lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt; and uppercase 
letters.  When you see such a variable, insert the appropriate 
information.  (It really doesn't matter what.) 
<P>
By the way, 8-)  8-)  8-) . 
<P>
<H4>ANY NEWS GROUP</H4>
<P>
01 - Hi!  I'm new to the net, and I was wondering if anyone could give 
me some advice on   what computer to buy/what text editor to use/what 
$15 modem to buy/why PROCOMM doesn't work. 
<P>
02 - Hi!  I've been reading the net for a while now, and thought I 
would try posting something.  I think the net is really great.  Keep 
it up! 
. 
<P>
<PRE>  :wq 
  ^D 
  QUIT 
  ^ 
</PRE><P>
</PRE>03  - I don't know anything about the content of your posting, but 
I don't think it is appropriate for this group.  Why don't you take 
this discussion to  rec.&lt;&lt;TOPIC&gt;&gt;.&lt;&lt;SILLY QUALIFIER&gt;&gt; ? 
<P>
04  - I don't know the answer to the question you posted, but I think 
someone asked this question 18 years ago on the net.  Don't remember 
if it got answered.  Hope this helps! 
<P>
05  - I'm not sure of the answer to the question you posted, but I seem 
to recall that I once thought I remembered reading in a book that may 
have had an author and title, but I'm not sure, that there may be some 
reasons for what you describe.  I have the book at home, but, since I 
don't want to delay this response by waiting till tomorrow, I am not 
bothering to look it up when I get home tonight.  Hope this helps! 
<P>
06  -  You made an error in  spelling/diction/grammar  in your recent 
posting, therefore you obviously don't know what you're talking about, 
and, since I don't know what I am talking about, I'm not even going to 
discuss the content of your posting. 
<P>
07  -  You have a non-American name, therefore you obviously don't know 
what you're talking about, and since I don't know what I'm talking 
about, I'm not even going to discuss the content of your posting. 
<P>
08  -  &lt;&lt;REFERENCE TO POSTING REGARDING HOUSE FOR SALE 
IN NEW JERSEY, REQUEST FOR RIDE TO WORK FROM WALTHAM 
TO CAMBRIDGE, CAR FOR SALE IN MOUNTAIN VIEW, OR OTHER 
REGIONAL TOPIC&gt;&gt;  Why are you posting this with intergalactic 
distribution?  Why am I posting this silly response with 
the same distribution? 
<P>
09  -  I used to enjoy reading the informative articles in this news 
group, but lately the articles have been rather irrelvant and abusive. 
If people don't stop misusing this group, I may have to unsubscribe. 
(This is stated seriously, as though someone would care.) 
<P>

CHILDREN'S DIGEST OR HUMPTY DUMPTY&gt;&gt; 
<P>
19  - &lt;&lt;RUNNING PUNS.  (These can be distinguished by the presence of 
greater-than signs equal to Avogadro's number.) 
<P>
20  - Since your posting contains no humorous content, shouldn't it be 
in rec.humor.d?  This, however, will not prevent me from posting this 
contribution to the discussion to rec.humor, instead of rec.humor.d. 
<P>
<H4>COMP.SYS.AMIGA</H4>
<P>
21  - Commodore could sell at least 18 more Amigas if they would 
advertise.

<P>
24  - Whoops!  LIVE! is not quite done.  I spoke to A-Squared by phone, 
and they said it's very nearly done, but that they decided to spend a 
bit more time and put some even neater stuff in it.  Watch for 
announcements when it is ready, which will be soon. 
<P>
25  - Is it possible for my Amiga to read disks from my &lt;&lt;ANY HOME

Woods Fur-Trappers' Convention in Winnipeg.
