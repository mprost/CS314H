A fellow was on his honeymoon near his favorite fishing lake and he would fish 
from dawn to dark with his favorite fishing guide.  One day the guide, friend 
of many years, mentioned that the honeymoon seemed to be spent fishing. 
<P>
"Yes, but you know how I love to fish..." 
<P>
"But aren't you newlyweds supposed to be into something else?" 
<P>
"Yes, but she's got gonorrhea; and you know how I love to fish" 
<P>
A few hours later, 
"I understand, but that's not the only way to have sex." 
<P>
"I know, but she's got diarrhea; and you know how I love to fish..." 
<P>
The following day: 
"Sure, but that's <EM>still</EM> not the only way to have sex." 
<P>
"Yeah, but she's got phyrrea<SUP>(*)</SUP>; and you know how I love to fish..." 
<P>
Late that afternoon, thoroughly frustrated: 
"I guess I'm not sure why you'd marry someone with health problems like that." 
<P>
"It's 'cause she's also got worms; and you know I just love to fish..." 
<P>
<SUP>(*)</SUP>Mouth rot
