Three guys are travelling across the country. Their car breaks down in 
the middle of nowhere, so they get out and start walking. They come 
across this farm, so they go up, knock on the door, and the farmer comes 
to the door and they explain their predicament to him. The farmer says 
he will drive them into town tomorrow, but they will have to wait until 
the morning, because everything in town is closed at this late hour. 
The farmer then offers them food, and lets them sleep in the garage. 
Before they go to sleep, the farmer comes out and tells them, "My daughter 
is a nymphomaniac. If I hear any one of you even thinking about f*cking her, 
I will blow your brains out." The farmer then leaves and goes to bed. 
<P>
About 2:00am one of the guys wakes up. The temptation is too great for him. 
He goes into the house and walks slowly up the stairs. About half way up 
the stairs, he hits a loose board. "CREAK!!!" Immediately the farmer wakes up. 
<P>
"Who's there?" the farmer cries. 
<P>
The first guy doesn't make a sound. Then he has an idea! "meow..... meow..." 
<P>
Pretty soon, the farmer goes back to sleep, the guy finishes climbing 
the stairs, and f*cks the daughter until his heart's content. He then 
goes back to the barn, completely satisfied. The second guy looks at him 
and says, "well?" 
<P>
"Oh, man. She was awesome. Best I ever had." 
<P>
So the second guy starts heading toward the house. The first guy says, 
"By the way, if you hit the loose stair, just pretend you're a pussy-cat." 
<P>
So, as the second guy climbs the stairs... "CREAK!" "Who's there?" 
"meow... meow...," and f*cks til his heart's content. 
<P>
When he gets back to the barn, the third guy looks over and says... "well?" 
<P>
"Awesome. Best I've ever had." 
<P>
So the third guy decides he will take his shot at the farmer's nymphomaniac. 
He goes into the house, and creeps slowly up the stairs. "CREAK!" "Who's 
there??? Who is it?" 
<P>
In a very low, meek voice, the third guy says..."it's just a littly 
pussy-cat." 
<P>
