One man explaining to another why he fired his secretary: 
<P>
"Two weeks ago," I said, ``was my forty-fifth birthday and I wasn't feeling too 
hot that morning anyway.  I went into the kitchen for breakfast knowing that my 
wife would be pleasant and say 'Happy Birthday' and probably have a present for 
me.  She didn't even say 'Good Morning' let alone say 'Happy Birthday'. 
<P>
``I said to myself 'Well that's wives for you.  The children will remember.' 
But the children came into breakfast and didn't say a word.  And when I started 
to the office, I was feeling pretty low and despondent. 
<P>
``As I walked into my office, Janet said 'Good Morning, Boss--Happy Birthday' 
and I felt a little bit better that someone had remembered. 
<P>
``I worked until noon.  About noon, Janet knocked on my door and said, 'You know 
it's such a beautiful day outside and it is your birthday, so let's go to 
lunch, just you and I.'  I said, 'By George, that is the greatest thing I have 
heard all day.  Let's go.' 
<P>
``We went to lunch.  We didn't go where we normally go, we went out into the 
country to a private place.  We had two Martinis and enjoyed lunch 
tremendously. 
<P>
``On the way back to the office, she said, 'You know, it's such a beautiful day 
we don't need to go back to the office, do we?'  I said, 'No, I guess not.' 
<P>
``She said, 'Let's go by my apartment, and I'll fix you another Martini.' 
<P>
``We went to her apartment.  We enjoyed another Martini and smoked a cigarette 
and she said, 'Boss, if you don't mind, I think I'll go into the bedroom and 
slip into something more comfortable' and I allowed her as I didn't mind at 
all. 
<P>
``She went into the bedroom and in about six minutes she came out of the bedroom 
carrying a big birthday cake followed by my wife and children.  All were 
singing 'Happy Birthday' and there I sat with nothing on but my socks.''
