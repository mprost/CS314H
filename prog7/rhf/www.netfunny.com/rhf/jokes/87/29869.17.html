(Zack needs to prepare readers for his humor, as it borders on the rediculous 
to downright silly!   the Hotline! series are actual events that have happened 
to him while working for the sanitary district.)

Hotline!<BR>
Part 4<BR>
by<BR>
James Zachary<BR>
(c) 1987<BR>
</center>
<P>
There are times that the telephone will ring in vain at  the 
water and sewer department, because there is no one there to 
answer it. 
<P>
The bartender at the local pub wanders over to the  slumping 
figure by the window. 
<P>
"Looks like you need a beer! Rough day at work?" 
<P>
Better make it a straight bourbon, a rough day at work makes 
me paranoid about amber liquids that foam. 
<P>
"Where do ya work?" 
<P>
At a sewage plant. 
<P>
"RIGHT!  One bourbon coming up!" 
<P>
(A comely young lady wearing tight jeans  and  a  'Save  the 
Armadillo' sweatshirt walks over.) 
<P>
"May I have a word with you?" 
<P>
No. 
<P>
"Awww, come on now, I just want to talk." 
<P>
Lady, if this is about your plugged sewer, or rusty drinking 
water  or  your house flooding last September, call our main 
office tomorrow during working hours. 
<P>
"Oh no, I don't live around here. I want to ask if  you  are 
willing to observe 
<P>
Please go away. 
<P>
"Do you know about 'Meatless Monday' and what  it  means  to 
the world?" 
<P>
It must have something to do with either 'Gay Rights' or the 
'Celibate  Society'  movements.  I'm  definitely  the  wrong 
person to talk to... please have a nice evening. 
<P>
"OH NO! 'Meatless Monday' is a worldwide  event  planned  to 
demonstrate  the cruelty of eating the flesh of other living 
animals. We propose all people become vegetarians." 
<P>
I really don't want to be a vegetable. 
<P>
"Vegetarian. Mankind does not have the right, nor  the  real 
need,  to  slaughter living creatures for food. Meat protein 
and fat are slowly killing you. Were you aware of that?" 
<P>
Sure beats getting knifed on the subway. 
<P>
"The more people we can get to  observe  'Meatless  Monday', 
the more animals will be saved from vicious slaughter." 
<P>
Vicious slaughter? 
<P>
"YES! Do you realize how cruelly animals are  killed  before 
butchering?  Most  are  just bludgeoned into unconsciousness 
and are then quartered alive!" 
<P>
I wondered where the `quarter-pounder' came from. 
<P>
"This is serious!  There are no standards set for the humane 
killing  of  animals  and we want all people to boycott meat 
products for one day, as a demonstration of unity." 
<P>
Sure, lady. I'll try not to eat anything until it  has  quit 
wiggling. 
<P>
"Are  you  involved  in  any  ecological   or   conservation 
programs?" 
<P>
Oh, yes Ma'am. I too believe all living  creatures  must  be 
protected.   I  am  a  member  of  the  `Save  the  Mosquito 
Committee'. I am the recruitment officer. 
<P>
"You are not serious! Just what does the recruitment officer 
do?" 
<P>
I try to find people willing to stand naked in the swamp  to 
act as feeding stations. Interested? 
<P>
"NO! Don't change the subject. Our group wants  to  convince 
as many people as possible to be vegetarians, but we realize 
that many will insist  on  eating  animal  flesh.  We  would 
settle  on  a standard that would require a humane method of 
killing them." 
<P>
That's easy. You can volunteer to talk to the animals. 
<P>
"I don't understand what good that would do." 
<P>
They would then simply die of boredom.
