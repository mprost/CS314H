A drunk (D) is leaning against a lightpost on the corner of a busy 
street. Whilst gazing blearily around, he notices a smartly dressed 
young man (YM) standing a few feet away, watching the people pass by. 
As D is watching, a lovely lady comes walking along, and the YM says 
something to her. She immediately smiles, shakes her head, and takes 
his hand. The two of them together go up the stairs of a nearby 
row house, and inside. 
<P>
A short while later, the two come back down the stairs, grinning from 
ear to ear. They embrace affectionately, and the lady departs. 
<P>
This happens several times in the next few hours with different ladies. 
Once the lady frowned, and after some further words from YM, merely 
nodded her head and walked on. The drunk strained his ears to hear 
what was being said, but just couldn't make it out. Finally, his 
curiosity overcame his need for vertical support, and he stumbled 
over to the young man. 
<P>
D:	Shay, bud. Wha' goin on? 
<P>
YM:	Yes, I saw you watching. I wondered when you would come over. 
Well, it's like this. I watch the people. When I see a lady 
that takes my fancy, I walk up to her and say, softly, "Tickle 
your ass with a feather?" If she is agreeable to the idea, 
we go upstairs to my room, and have a good time. If she becomes 
upset, I merely say, "Typical nasty weather." She assumes that 
she misheard me the first time, and just keeps going. I can't 
loose! 
<P>
D:	(now swaying) Thas a grate idea! Ill have to run home and try 
it mysel. 
<P>
So the drunk wobbles to his own home and stands leaning against the 
fence. Soon a very lovely lady comes (VLL) walking briskly along, and 
the drunk decides that this is his CHANCE. So he stumbles over to the 
lady and grabs her arm. 
<P>
VLL:	Yes? 
<P>
D:	(shouting) HEY BABE, C'N I STICK A FEATHER UP YOUR ASS? 
<P>
VLL:	WHAT? 
<P>
D:	(looking at the sky) Fuckin rain! 
<P>
