1) Submitted by several, first Greg Woods 
<P>
Q: What's the difference between a pigeon and a stockbroker? 
<P>
A: The pigeon can still make a deposit on a BMW. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
2) Submitted by several, first Kyle Adler 
<P>
These two women were walking through the forest when they hear this 
voice from under a log.  Investigating, the women discovered the voice 
was coming from a frog: 
<P>
"Help me, ladies!  I am an investment banker who, through an evil 
witch's curse, has been transformed into a frog.  If one of you will 
kiss me, I'll be returned to my former state!" 
<P>
The first woman took out her purse, grabbed the frog, and stuffed it 
inside her handbag.  The second woman, aghast, screamed, "Didn't you 
hear him?  If you kiss him, he'll turn into an investment banker?" 
<P>
The second woman replied, "Sure, but these days a talking frog is 
worth more than an investment banker!" 
<P>
<HR>
3) From Patricia Giencke--and the New York Times 
<P>
Merrill Lynch has adjusted its investment portfolio: 
50% cash and 50% canned goods. 
<P>
Bumper sticker on Wall Street:  My other Porsche is for sale. 
<P>
How many investment bankers can you fit in the back of a pickup truck? 
Only 2 - you have to leave room for the lawn mowers! 
<P>
I have an uncle down at Wall Street.  He used to have a corner on the market. 
Now he has a market on the corner. 
<P>
"Get my broker, Miss Jones." 
<P>
"Yes sir.  Stock, or Pawn?" 
<P>
<HR>
4) Some very, very old jokes used in just about all bad times, now applied to 
the market: 
<P>
Q: In these busy market times, how can you get the attention of 
your broker? 
<P>
A: Say, "Hey, waiter!" 
<P>
--------- 
<P>
How do you get a broker down from a tree? 
<P>
Cut the rope. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
5) 
The market may be bad, but I slept like a baby last night. 
I woke up every hour and cried. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Many have sent jokes about broker suicides.  Since there actually 
were very few, if any, both now and in 1929, these didn't really 
get much of a laugh.  You could also see them all coming down 
6th avenue, so I'm not posting.
