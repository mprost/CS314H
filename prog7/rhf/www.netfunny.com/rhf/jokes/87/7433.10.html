<P>
The group shared their favorites.  Windows that crack or melt into a 
slag heap.  The MacIntosh  IBM DOS emulator that, when fired up, 
begins to put up a zippy MacIntosh screen, stops halfway down the 
screen to declare, "Oops?  Sorry.  You wanted 1950s technology."  It 
then goes into command line mode.  The supposed unused ROM hook in 
the Mac that would have caused a monkey to dance across the screen 
ONCE upon the 7698th (or whatever) boot of the machine.  Insects 
crawling around the screen. 
<P>
As you read this, project programmers in ski-masks are already coding 
up: 
<P>
<FONT size=+2>ELUSIVE MENU:</FONT>  When the mouse cursor enters such menus, the menus 
dodge away while insulting the user with appropriate language and 
gestures.  Somebody informed us this is just like the Mac Bomb 
program. 
<P>
<FONT size=+2>CRASHING WINDOWS:</FONT>  You begin to move a window.  Suddenly it 
accelerates out of your control up toward the corner of the screen. 
When it reaches the corner, it smashes to pieces, falling to the 
bottom of the screen.  Appropriate sounds effects are heard.  Email 
is sent to the site manager blaming you for the broken window. 
<P>
<FONT size=+2>AEROBIC WINDOWS:</FONT>  You begin to move a window and suddenly it 
accelerates out of your control bouncing around the screen faster 
and faster.  It finally slows down an sits on your screen off in the 
direction you were moving it, but huffing and puffing, sort of 
expanding in and out.  You begin working again, its breathing slows 
and stops after a few moments. 
<P>
<FONT size=+2>PEOPLE INSIDE THE MONITOR:</FONT>  You get an error.  A large face leans in 
from the left, gives you a "Lettermanesque look," like he's got a 
horrible flavor on his tongue, and then leans back out of the 
monitor. 
<P>
<FONT size=+2>GIGANTIC SCREEN-FILLING BODY PART MOUSE CURSOR ICONS:</FONT>  You can move 
them no more than a half inch in each direction.  Need the 
Interface-esE liberation Army say more?
