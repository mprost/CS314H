<STRONG>[Ed: By David Wald, unless somebody else steps forward ]</STRONG> 
<P>
...Let us suppose that the Enterprise is doing some sort of 
research mission to an unknown planet.  I think the Captain's Log would 
be worth a look: 
<P>
Captain's Log, Stardate 54324.5:  Starfleet Command has directed the 
Enterprise to do a preliminary exploration of planet --- in advance of a 
full research team.  Scanners report the atmosphere to be breathable, 
but are receiving confusing readings with regard to life forms.  I am 
beaming down with a landing party composed of all our chief officers 
except for poor Scotty. 
<P>
Supplement:  Redshirt Riley has received a head injury, apparently while 
exploring under a high rock shelf.  He reports only hearing a loud sound 
and jumping before being struck.  After examination by Dr. McCoy he has 
been judged capable of continuing duty. 
<P>
Supplement:  We have encountered an alien creature on this planet. 
While it does not itself seem menacing, a unfortunate occurrence took 
place when it was present.  Specifically, on my orders Lt. Sulu 
withdrew his phaser.  The creature disappeared leaving a puff of smoke, 
immediately following which a loud noise was heard next to Sulu.  Sulu 
fired, hitting Ens. Chekov.  Oddly enough, although Sulu's weapon was 
set to stun, Chekov was also covered with a black powder similar to 
soot.  Mr. Chekov has been sent back to the ship for examination and 
quarantine. 
<P>
Stardate 54326.2, Mr. Spock reporting:  Tricorder readings indicate that 
the creature we encountered earlier is constantly moving at great speed 
over the surface of the planet.  We have encountered the creature once 
again.  In an attempt to slow the creature for study, I attempted to 
fire on it.  The creature, however, appeared to move faster than the 
phaser beam.  Regretfully, the beam struck an outcropping of rock above 
the Captain's head, causing it to break off and fall.  Although it 
appears that several tons of rock fell squarely on the Captain, he was 
driven straight into the ground but apparently not seriously injured, 
though stunned.  The Captain has been beamed up to Sickbay, leaving me 
in command of the research party. 
<P>
Captain's Log, Stardate 54342.1:  The creature is still at large on the 
planet's surface.  While Mr. Spock continues to lead a research party I am 
currently at work with Mr. Scott on an Acme Pressure Cooker for our lab, 
for when the creature is finally apprehended. 
<P>
Captain's Log, stardate 54342.3.  The strange occurences that have 
dogged the landing party since our arrival at this planet have led me to 
believe that the creature is in some way directly responsible for them. 
Mr. Chekov and I have both been declared fit for return to duty, though 
Dr. McCoy has entered in his medical log that he feels we should be kept 
under observation.  Mr. Spock has constructed a device which he suspects 
should be able to counteract the creature's incredible speed as follows: 
We have placed a dish of birdseed out in the open, with several signs 
pointing to it.  The dish is atop a cleverly concealed trap door, which 
will open when any weight falls on it.  The creature will then travel a 
slide, eventually being deposited in a cage constructed of sheets of 
transparent aluminum.  We will then be free to analyze it at our 
leisure.  Meanwhile, I have forbidden all beaming down to the surface of 
the planet except on my or Mr. Spock's direct order. 
<P>
Captain's Log, supplemental.  The plan failed.  The creature was indeed 
lured by the birdseed, as expected.  It sped to the dish, consumed the 
bait, and sped off without setting off the trap.  Mr. Spock is as 
puzzled as I, and has begun tests to discover the flaw in the design.  I 
have sent out three search parties to see if we can box the creature in, 
one headed by Mr. Sulu, one by Mr. Chekov, and one by Sociologist 
Xontel. 
<P>
Captain's Log, stardate 54342.8.  Sociologist Xontel has been 
temporarily incapacitated.  In pursuing the creature, he and his men 
somehow managed to cross the place where Mr. Spock's trap was set just 
as he completed the corrections to it.  The trap was sprung, and all 
four of my men were suspended for a moment in mid-air, puzzled, just 
before they fell into the cage we constructed.  We are now trying to 
release them with phasers, as the lock was inadvertently smashed by the 
impact from Sociologist Xontel's foot as he fell.  I consider this a 
major setback.  Mr. Spock considers it "fascinating." 
<P>
Captain's Log, stardate 54343.4.  In an all-out attempt to stop the 
creature once and for all, I have had a phaser rifle beamed down from 
the Enterprise.  The creature has behaved in an extremely cunning 
manner, yet I am unsure whether this is a sign of actual intelligence. 
Lt.  Uhura has been unsuccessful in her attempts to raise Starfleet 
Command.  Meanwhile, Mr. Scott informs me that our dilithium crystals 
are deteriorating at an alarming rate.  He has juryrigged a system that 
will prevent the decay for a time, but it is imperative that we find new 
crystals soon. 
<P>
Captain's Log, supplemental.  Mr. Sulu reports high energy tricorder 
readings from an area of the planet in which the creature has not yet 
been sighted.  He has taken a small party, including Mr. Spock, to the 
high-elevation spot from which the readings emanate.  I have begun to 
analyze the creature's movements.  It seems to travel consistently over 
a set path.  Perhaps we can corner it in a tunnel it seems to pass 
through frequently. 
<P>
Captain's Log, stardate 54344.7.  Mr. Sulu has located a cache of ACME 
dilithium crystals atop a high cliff.  Regretfully, while collecting 
them, the edge of the cliff broke off, and he and Mr. Spock plummetted 
several hundred feet to the ground below.  Strangely enough, they both 
survived the fall with no more than raising a cloud of dust on impact, 
although they did pass the chunk of rock on the way down and end up 
completely buried.  A rescue excavation has commenced, and they should 
be safe shortly. 
<P>
Captain's Log, stardate 54344.9.  Mr. Spock has beamed up to the ship 
with them to assist Mr. Scott in their installation, as he forsees 
compatability problems.  Back on the planet's surface, Mr. Chekov led 
seven men into the tunnel in an attempt to capture the creature in 
transit.  A loud BEEP, BEEP was heard, and Chekov aimed the phaser rifle 
and commanded his men to spread out.  I wish to state for the record 
that I would have acted similarly, and that Ensign Chekov should in no 
way be held responsible for the unfortunate circumstances arising from 
the unexpected appearance of an old Earth-style freight train.  He has 
been beamed back up to the ship with minor injuries. 
<P>
Captain's Log, stardate 54345.1.  Dr. McCoy has beamed down with a hypo 
containing a mixture of kyranide, tri-ox compound, Scalosian 
concentrate, a theragram derivative, and some other items he found in 
unmarked containers in Sickbay.  By injecting a small amount into each 
member of the landing party, I hope to be able to deal with the creature 
on its own high speed terms. 
<P>
Captain's Log, supplemental.  The latest experiment to deal with the 
strange creature has failed.  As Dr. McCoy was injecting a measured dose 
of the compound, it abruptly appeared behind him and uttered a loud 
BEEP, BEEP!  Dr. McCoy, understandably flustered, accidentally pressured 
in the entire contents of the hypo into his arm.  A full security team 
is in pursuit of him, waiting for the effects of the drug to wear off. 
<P>
Captain's Log, stardate 54345.2.  I have ordered the landing party 
transported back to the ship.  The new dilithium crystals have been 
successfully installed.  On my responsibility, the ship is preparing to 
engage main phasers to attack the creature, which continues on its 
semi-erratic course across the planet's surface. 
<P>
Captain's Log, supplemental.  This is a warning to all other starships 
that may pass this way.  Do not approach this planet!  The illogical 
events occuring here are too much to overcome with simple science.  If 
you have heard the events transcribed in the rest of this log, you will 
learn that this creature is nearly undefeatable.  We channelled full 
ship's power through the phaser banks.  Theoretically, the creature 
should have been destroyed; however, the energies were too much strain 
for the ACME crystals.  The full force of the phasers backlashed over 
the Enterprise, engulfing her completely.  At first, the only noticeable 
effect was a complete failure of all systems save emergency gravity and 
life support.  Then a web of black lines spread through the Enterprise's 
superstructure.  Next, the ship began breaking up, piece by piece, 
falling through the atmosphere to land on the surface of the planet. 
When the ship had collapsed entirely, my crew was left hanging in space 
for a short time, and finally each of us began to fall to the planet 
below.  We have no theories on how any of us survived, but every 
crewmember has reported nothing more than a sense of uneasiness, 
followed by the realization that they were several hundred miles up in 
the air, a sinking sensation, and then a gradual drop:  first the feet, 
then the body, and finally the head, usually wearing a resigned 
expression of perplexion.  We are attempting now to communicate with the 
creature in the hopes that it will prove intelligent.  Perhaps we can 
communicate our peaceful intentions to it.  Mr. Spock has constructed a 
crude rocket launcher from the wreckage of the ship, and with this we 
hope to send the recorder marker up into space, where hopefully someone 
will find it.  Captain James T. Kirk, of the United Federation of 
Planets, Captain of the Starship Enterprise, recording.
