<CENTER>THE CREATION</CENTER><BR>
<P>
In the beginning, all was void, with the spirit of  God 
brooding over the dark vapors. 
<P>
Then God said, "Let there be Byte," and there was Byte. 
God  saw  the Byte, and was pleased with it, and divided the 
Byte into Bits.  He created a multitude of zeros, for  zeros 
were all there were. 
<P>
On the  Second  day  God  toyed  with  the  Bytes,  and 
organized  some  of them into groups, to which He said, "You 
shall be called Words, for from Bytes you came, and of Bytes 
are you composed." 
<P>
On the Third day God said (to whom God was talking  has 
never  been  ascertained or even questioned), "I have Words, 
made  up  of  Bytes,  made  up  of  Bits.   But  something's 
missing." 
<P>
So God scraped up a lump of clay, squeezed  it  tightly 
in  His mighty hands, and flung it against the sky, where it 
solidified into a smokey mass.  God saw the  steaming  heap, 
that  it  was  good,  and  was pleased, and said to it, "You 
shall be called Hardware, a home for My Words and Bytes  and 
Bits,  and  as  you  are the very first of your kind I shall 
call you CPU." 
<P>
And God turned, and with a flick of  His  wrist  spewed 
forth  tape drives ("For you shall serve as a temporary home 
for My words..."), discs,  paper  tape,  terminals,  on-line 
printers,   entire  remote  stations,  whole  teleprocessing 
installations. 
<P>
And God saw all this sparkling in the heavens, that  it 
was good, and He was pleased. 
<P>
Having done all this, God rested. 
<P>
On the Fourth day, God reviewed all that He  had  done. 
He  saw  His  Bits  and  His Bytes residing statically on an 
infinite  variety  of  media.   But  He  was  not   pleased. 
"Something's  missing,"  said  He.   "I  need  to animate My 
treasured Bytes, to give them Life." 
<P>
So God leaned back, touched a soiled hand to His mighty 
brow,  and  with  one  single, all-powerful thought, set His 
hardware in motion. 
<P>
"You," said He to the intangible  breath  now  coursing 
through His hardware, "I shall call software, for..." and so 
on, and so forth. 
<P>
And He continued, "You are the  first,  the  best,  the 
most  perfect  and  omnipotent  software."  And  divided the 
software into many parts;  into utilities, compilers, system 
libraries  and  His  favorite,  most privilieged and beloved 
operating system. 
<P>
God was pleased, so He rested. 
<P>
On the Fifth day, God again surveyed all  that  He  had 
done,  and  was  filled  with  joy.   He found that with His 
creation he could determine the value of Pi to ten  thousand 
digits.   He  found  that He could produce flowcharts of His 
beloved operating system, and these He posted by His throne. 
He  discovered  that  He  could  run  off  Snoopy calenders, 
pictures  of  the  Mona  Lisa,  and  witty  little  computer 
accounts  of  The  Creation.   And  with  a  terminal at His 
throne, He didn't have to travel halfway to Hell  to  access 
His system. 
<P>
He called His creation "Imperatatum Byte Magnamus"  (or 
"IBM" for short). 
<P>
But all was not well.   God's  beloved  system  was  so 
large,   so  complex,   that  even the mighty God - maker of 
heavens and earth  (but that's another story),  the  Builder 
of the CPU and virtual memory, the Author of Fortran - 
<P>
was hard-pressed to keep up on how everything worked. 
<P>
So God said, "I'll make Me a Man." 
<P>
And He did, and to the  man  He  said,  "You  shall  be 
called  (logically  enough) "Man," and to you shall fall the 
responsibility of maintaining all that I have done." 
<P>
And to keep man happy after-hours, God gave him  Woman, 
saying  to man, "For I know that even Bytes get lonely for a 
little Bit." 
<P>
And God rested, chuckling at His  own  little  play  on 
words. 
<P>
On the Sixth day, God mounted His throne,  logged  onto 
His  terminal,  and  engaged  in a full day of uninterrupted 
1-second turnaround.  He saw all that He had done,  that  it 
was  good.   He  was pleased that from His first Byte He had 
created such a wonderful and extensive toy.  He created file 
after  file,  He  performed  advanced and impressive on-line 
data base updates, He wrote  a  faster  and  more  extensive 
Fortran  compiler, and in general rejoiced in the perfection 
of His I.B.M. 
<P>
After a hard day's work on  a  hot  terminal  -  during 
which  man was quitely familiarizing himself with the system 
documentation - God called it  a  day  ("You  I  shall  call 
day..." and so forth) and went to sleep. 
<P>
On the Seventh day - so tired was He  from  the  week's 
labors - God slept all day.  What transpired on that crucial 
seventh day is recounted in the "Fall of Man..." 
<P>
<CENTER>THE FALL OF MAN</CENTER><BR>
<P>
Late in the Sixth day of creation, woman called him  at 
work  and  begged  him  to  come home, as dinner was getting 
cold.  Man grudgingly consented, but brought home with him a 
copy of the system documentation to study. 
<P>
After dinner, woman cooed some suggestive little  sighs 
and  slipped invitingly into bed.  Man followed, but - being 
beat after a hard day at  the  office  -  fell  straight  to 
sleep.   Woman  had an indescribable inner feeling that this 
was not how things should be on their first night in bed (or 
in existence, for that matter), and disdainfully flung man's 
notebook from the nightstand.  The  book  fell  open  to  an 
important-looking page marked "WARNING" in bold letters. 
<P>
Now, woman was possessed of insatiable curiosity.   God 
-   we  must  assume  -  had  been  entirely  familiar  with 
contempary Greek writings on the subject, particularly  with 
the  escapades  of a wayward feminist named Pandora.  At any 
rate, woman picked up the book, and read:  WARNING:  "You  I 
have  created  to  matintatin  application  programs  and to 
operate My beloved I.B.M.  You may partake of My  utilities, 
My  Fortran, My files and tapes and flowcharts.  But with My 
operating system thou shalt not tamper, for to the  user  it 
giveth unlimited MASTER MODE powers..." 
<P>
Woman  -  being  as  greedy  as  she  was  beautiful  - 
immediately woke man.  She derided him for his sheepishness, 
for his lack of initiative, for his cowering before a  silly 
machine.   She  filled  his  mind with thoughts of power and 
greed, and instilled in him the resolve to win  for  himself 
all the privileges of the operating system. 
<P>
Besides, reasoned woman, as boss, man won't  come  home 
dead tired, and might be worth something after dinner... 
<P>
So man  returned  to  work  the  next  day,  intent  on 
breaching  the operating system.  He needled, he patched, he 
disguised clever little traps in his programs  which  -  for 
tantalyzingly  brief  periods  of time - slipped into master 
mode.  By the end of the Seventh day, man was  so  close  to 
mastering  the  operating system that he didn't go home 'til 
very late.  So pleased was he - and so sure that the  coming 
day  would reward him with total control of God's own system 
- that he whistled all the way home, and when he  got  there 
snuck into the bedroom and gave woman a pleasant surprise... 
<P>
Early on the Eighth day, man did it.  God  was  on  the 
terminal early, playing blackjack with His computer.  So man 
was able to submit his carefully-prepared batch job  without 
being  noticed.   The  system burped, God's terminal blinked 
once but then all was normal.  Man's heart lept.  It was his 
operating  system  now,  not  God's.   For a moment he stood 
stunned with  the  impact  of  his  move.   Then  -  with  a 
self-assurance   that  only  novice  programmers  can  truly 
appreciate - he seated himself at the  master  console,  and 
pushed   the   attention  key.   His  hands  trembling  with 
excitement, he began to type "DELETE G-O-D." 
<P>
BINGO. 
<P>
Just as He was about to hit the carriage return  -  and 
with  the  system  $500  ahead  in God's blackjack game (God 
holding 20 for a thousand-dollar pot) - the system crashed. 
<P>
God was furious. 
<P>
"You ignored My warning," said  He  to  man,  as  woman 
wailed  pathetically that she had had nothing to do with it. 
"You violated My beloved system, and dared  think  that  you 
could become as one with God." 
<P>
He waved man disdainfully  from  His  sight.   He  then 
reached  into His I.B.M., took a handful of core, mutilated 
it a little, and flung it after man. 
<P>
"Go," said He to the slice of core, "and multiply  into 
a  host  of  inferior  systems,  each  more  prostituted and 
glitch-filled than the last.  And perhaps if man's  time  is 
wasted  debugging  inferior  systems, I won't be bothered by 
him." 
<P>
And that - according to the book of Byte - is  why  the 
world  consists  of two type of computers:  IBM, and all the 
rest. 
<P>
And so it is that certain individuals are born to serve 
God's favorite IBM, while others are condemned to suffer the 
damnation of amateur "other" computer companies. 
<P>
But if you're very  good,  and  if  you're  honest  and 
trustworthy  and  like  to  work  twenty hours a day without 
material reward, then you may well hope  that  one  day  you 
will  be  selected  to move up through Xerox to Burroughs to 
Honeywell to Univac to that great system in  the  sky  whose 
initials inspire men to this very day - I.B.M.. 
<P>
