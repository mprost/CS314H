And now for a joke (that I probably heard here): 
<P>
There was this world famous painter.  In the prime of her career, 
she started losing her eyesight.  Fearful that she might lose 
her life as a painter, she went to see the best eye surgeon in the 
world.  After several weeks of delicate surgery and therapy, her 
eyesight was restored.  The painter was so grateful that she 
decided to show her gratitude by repainting the doctor's office. 
Part of her work included painting a gigantic eye on one wall. 
When she had finished her work, she held a press conference to 
unveil her latest work of art: the doctor's office.  During the 
press conference, one reporter noticed the eye on the wall, and 
asked the doctor, "What was your first reaction upon seeing your 
newly painted office, especially that large eye on the wall?" 
To this, the eye doctor responded, "I said to myself 
'Thank God I'm not a gynecologist.' 
<P>
