The abbot of a nearby abbey was out in the nearby city running errands 
downtown when he saw a woman of questionable character say to a passerby, 
"Twenty bucks for a blowjob," at which point the passerby and the woman promptly 
went down the next alley, where they went out of view. 
<P>
The abbot was perplexed, for the very same thing occurred at another 
streetcorner in the city.  He was walking down a sidewalk, when another woman, 
much the same as the first, stated to another passerby, "Twenty bucks for a 
blowjob," at which point the two rapidly went into a nearby alley, where 
the abbot couldn't see what was going on.   Still not knowing what a "blowjob" 
was, the abbot left the city as naive as he was upon entering it. 
<P>
Back up the hill, the abbot was still contemplating what a blowjob was, so 
he went to see the mother superior at the adjacent convent.  "Mother 
superior," he asked, "what's a blowjob?" 
<P>
"Twenty bucks, same as downtown!"
