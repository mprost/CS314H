I found this posting on rec.arts.startrek.  Anyone who has seen 
Star Trek II:  the Wrath of Khan, and knows unix should enjoy this.

I was watching Star Trek II again last night when suddenly I had 
this vision of what would happen if instead of a duel between 
starships, it was computer systems.  What resulted is this: 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<PRE><B>Kirk:</B>	What is the meaning of this attack? 
<B>Khan:</B>	Surely I have made my meaning clear.  I mean to avenge myself 
	upon you, Admiral.  I deprived your system of UUCP connections 
	and when I swing around I mean to deprive you of your life. 
	But I wanted you to know who it was who had beaten you. 
<B>Kirk:</B>	Khan, if it's me you want, I'll have myself rcp'ed over.  Spare 
	my crew. 
<B>Khan:</B>	I make you a counter-proposal.  I'll agree to your terms, if ... 
	if in addition to yourself you hand over to me all data and 
	materials regarding the project called UUNET. 
<B>Kirk:</B>	UUNET?  What's that? 
<B>Khan:</B>	Don't insult my intelligence, Kirk. 
<B>Kirk:</B>	Give me some time to recall the data from our archives. 
<B>Khan:</B>	I give you sixty seconds. 
<B>Kirk:</B>	Clear the bridge. 
<B>Spock:</B>	At least we know he doesn't have UUNET. 
<B>Kirk:</B>	Keep nodding as though I'm still giving orders.  Mr. Saavik, 
	punch up the data charts of Reliant's password file. 
<B>Saavik:</B>	Reliant's pass... 
<B>Kirk:</B>	Hurry. 
<B>Khan:</B>	Forty-five seconds Admiral. 
<B>Spock:</B>	The free login? 
<B>Kirk:</B>	It's all we've got. 
<B>Saavik:</B>	File's up, sir. 
<B>Khan:</B>	Admiral. 
<B>Kirk:</B>	We're finding it. 
<B>Khan:</B>	Admiral. 
<B>Kirk:</B>	Please.  Please you've got to give us time.  The machine room is 
	smashed, the editors inoperable. 
<B>Khan:</B>	Time is a luxury you don't have, Admiral. 
<B>Kirk:</B>	Damn. 
<B>Khan:</B>	Admiral? 
<B>Kirk:</B>	It's coming through now, Khan. 
<B>Spock:</B>	Reliant's free login is 16309. 
<B>Saavik:</B>	I don't understand. 
<B>Kirk:</B>	You have to learn why things work on a UNIX system. 
<B>Spock:</B>	Each system has its own hidden free login. 
<B>Kirk:</B>	To prevent an enemy from doing what we're attempting.  We're 
	using our console to order Reliant to let us login. 
<B>Spock:</B>	Assuming he hasn't changed the combination.  He's quite 
	intelligent. 
<B>Khan:</B>	Fifteen seconds, Admiral. 
<B>Kirk:</B>	Khan, how do we know you'll keep your word? 
<B>Khan:</B>	Oh, I've given you no word to keep, Admiral.  In my judgement, 
	you simply have no alternative. 
<B>Kirk:</B>	I see your point.  Stand by to receive our mail message.  Mr. 
	Sulu, lock an Internet connection on target and await my order 
	to login. 
<B>Sulu:</B>	Connection pending. 
<B>Khan:</B>	Time's up, Admiral. 
<B>Kirk:</B>	Here it comes.  Now, Mr. Spock. 
<B>Spock:</B>	% telnet reliant 
Trying... 
Connected to reliant. 
Escape character is '~'.

<B>Joachim:</B> Sir, the Enterprise is logging on. 
<B>Khan:</B>	Kill them. 
<B>Joachim:</B> I can't! 
<B>Khan:</B>	Where's the chroot call?  The chroot call! 
<B>Kirk:</B>	Fire.

<B>Joachim:</B> We can't reboot! 
<B>Khan:</B>	Why can't you!? 
<B>Joachim:</B> They've corrupted the file system and the /etc directory!  Sir, 
	we must power-cycle. 
<B>Khan:</B>	No! 
<B>Joachim:</B> Sir, we must!
