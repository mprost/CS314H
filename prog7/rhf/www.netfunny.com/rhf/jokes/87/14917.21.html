(It's an oldie, but a goodie.) 
<P>
There was this guy who went into a bar.  He went up to 
the bartender and said, "Bartender, are you a bettin' man?" 
<P>
The bartender replied, "Certainly!  I'm ALWAYS a bettin' 
man!"  To which the man said, "I'll bet you $50 that I can 
lick my right eye." 
<P>
The bartender thought about this a while 
and finally agreed to the bet.  The man reached up and pulled 
out his glass right eye and licked it.  The bartender groaned 
and begrudgingly gave the man his $50 telling him to leave 
his bar. 
<P>
A week or so later, the same man appeared in the bar.  He went 
up to the bartender and said, "Bartender, are you still a bettin' 
man?"  The bartender replied, "Certainly!  I told you I'm ALWAYS 
a bettin' man!"  To which the man said, "I'll bet you $100 that 
I can bite my left eye." 
<P>
Well, the bartender thought he had 
him on this one!  There was no way that he had TWO glass eyes 
so the bartender agreed.  The man reached up to his mouth, pulled 
out his dentures and clicked them on his left eye.  The bartender 
moaned and paid the man his $100 telling him to get out of his 
bar. 
<P>
A week or so later, the same man ventured into the bar again. 
He went up to the bartender and said, "Bartender, are you still 
a bettin' man?"  The bartender said, although with a little 
caution this time, "Certainly!  I told you I'm ALWAYS a bettin' 
man!"  To which the man said, "Give me a shot of whiskey." 
The bartender poured the man a shot and he drank it down.  Slamming 
the glass on the bar he said, "I'll bet you $500 that you can 
spin me around on this bar stool and I can piss in that glass 
right where it lays and not miss a drop." 
<P>
Well, the bartender's 
eyes lit up.  Here was one time that he was certain that he 
would win!  "Agreed!" he cried.  Coming out from around the bar, 
he grabbed onto the man's bar stool and spun it as hard as he could. 
<P>
Well, the man just let loose and piss flew EVERYPLACE!  Not so 
much as one drop even came close to the glass and the bartender 
was soaked.  When he was done, the bartender was laughing and 
laughing and holding out his hand.  The man pulled out his wallet and 
gave him his $500.  But the bartender was puzzled and as he was wiping 
off his face, he asked the man, "Why did you bet me $500 that you could 
piss in that shot glass on the bar when you had to have known there 
wasn't any possible way to do it??" 
<P>
The man just smiled and told him, 
"You may have won $500 off me but I bet that guy over in the 
corner $10,000 that I could piss all over you and your bar 
and you would just laugh!"
