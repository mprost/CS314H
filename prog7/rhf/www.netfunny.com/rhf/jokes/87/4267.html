The Polish were upset because of their bad reputation.  A group of them 
got together and approached a conference of Americans, Germans, and 
Japanese and asked for help on this matter.  An American replied, 
"You must do something so the world will respect you.  The Japanese 
are known for their technology and the Germans are known for their 
resourcefulness.  We Americans have had respect since we helped win 
the World War against the other two.  See, you need to do something 
world-famous."  A German added," Yes, he's right.  Why don't you find 
a place in this world in need of a bridge that no one has dared build, 
build it, come back to us, and we will help publicize it." 
<P>
With that, the Polish set off to build their bridge.  They designed it 
and worked 6 months and finally completed it.  They then went back to 
report it to the group.  The bridge was a beautiful bridge but it had 
one flaw:  it was erected in the middle of the Sahara Desert.  An 
American said, "No, no.  See, that is why you have your reputation. 
There is no need for a bridge in the middle of the desert.  Now go 
and dismantle it, and find a more strategic spot to erect it." 
<P>
The Polish returned to the conference in two weeks.  One of the Japanese 
said, "Two weeks!  It only took you two weeks to dismantle that bridge 
and build a new one??? That is amazing!!"  To which a Polish man replied, 
"Well, not exactly.  When we returned to the bridge we couldn't dismantle 
it because there were all these Italians fishing off it."
