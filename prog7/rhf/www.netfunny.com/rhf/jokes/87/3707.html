A World War II pilot is reminiscing before school children about his 
days in the air force.  (Joke best delivered with a good thick accent) 
<P>
"In 1942," he says, "the situation was really tough.  The Germans had a very 
strong air force.  I remember, " he continues, "one day I was protecting the 
bombers and suddenly, out of the clouds, these fokkers appeared. 
<P>
(At this point, several of the children giggle.) 
<P>
I looked up, and right above me was one of them.  I aimed at him and 
shot him down.  They were swarming.  I immediately realized that there was 
another fokker behind me." 
<P>
At this instant the girls in the auditorium start to giggle and boys 
start to laugh.  The teacher stands up and says, "I think I should point 
out that 'Fokker' was the name of the German-Dutch aircraft company" 
<P>
"That's true," says the pilot, "but these fokkers were flying Messerschmidts."
