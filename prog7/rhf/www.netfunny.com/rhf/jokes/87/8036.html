It's Holiday time.  I suspect that anybody who's read rec.humor over 
the last few years has probably seen this piece.  Nonetheless, it 
remains one of the best such bits, and for the estimated 6,000 of you 
that don't read rec.humor, I'm including it.  It contains abusive 
and obscene language, but it's necessary. 
<P>
As the holidays approach, I will be posting just a few jokes, mostly 
Christmas related ones, as I expect most of you readers out there will 
be leaving your computer terminals for airline terminals.  As for me, 
it's my policy not to shop until the 24th.  It makes it more exciting. 
<P>
Remember to spend extravagantly, or you'll have to listen to economists 
talk about how consumer indicators are down for at least three months. 
At least, that's how the mall manager explained it to me.  And remember, 
malls are what made America abandon its urban cores, turning them 
into blighted slums that Yuppies could buy cheap.  So be patronizing 
to their retailers this season. 
<P>
Have a good time, and wherever you go, don't forget the true meaning 
of Christmas--the free travel vouchers you get when the airline bumps 
you.

My Darling, 
<P>
I went to the door today and the postman delivered a "Partridge in a pear 
tree."  What a thoroughly delightful gift.  I couldn't have been more surprised. 
You're an angel.

Darling,

Today, the postman brought your very sweet gift.  Just imagine "Two turtle 
doves."  I'm delighted at your very thoughtful gift.  They are adorable and I 
love you for them.

Dear Fred, 
<P>
Oh!  Aren't you the extravagant one?  Now I really must protest.  I don't 
deserve such generosity as "Three French hens."  They are just darling but I 
must insist, you've been too kind.

Love,

Dear Fred,

Today the postman delivered "Four calling birds."  Now really, they are 
beautiful but don't you think enough is enough?  You're being too romantic.

Dearest Fred, 
<P>
What a surprise!  The postman just delivered the "Five golden rings"; one 
for every finger.  You're just impossible, but I love it.  Frankly, all those 
birds squawking were beginning to get on my nerves. 
<P>
All my love,

Dear Fred, 
<P>
I couldn't believe my eyes this morning as I walked out onto the front 
porch and there were "Six geese a laying" on my front steps.  So you're back 
to the birds again - huh?  Those geese are huge.  Where will I ever keep 
them? The neighbors are complaining and I can't sleep through the racket. 
I love your thoughtfulness, but - 
<P>
Please Stop! 
<P>
Cordially, 
<P>

Fred, 
<P>
What's with you and those fucking birds???  Today I received "Seven swans 
a swimming."  What kind of a goddamn joke is this?  These birds shit 
all over the house and they never stop with that awful goddamn racket. 
I can't sleep at night and I'm a nervous wreck. 
<P>
Stop your laughing damn you!  It's not funny.  Just knock it off with 
those fucking birds, OK????? 
<P>

OK Buster, 
<P>
I think I prefer the birds.  What the hell am I going to do with "Eight 
maids a milking??"  It's not enough with all those birds and the 8 maids 
milking, but they had to bring their goddamn cows!  There is shit all over the 
lawn and I can't even move in my own house.  Just lay off me, smartass!!

Hey Shithead, 
<P>
What are you???  Some kind of sadist???  Now I've got "Nine pipers 
playing" and Christ do they play!  They haven't stopped chasing those maids 
since they've arrived this morning.  The cows are getting upset and they're 
stepping all over the screeching fucking birds.  What the hell am I going to 
do??  The neighbors have already started a petition to have me evicted.

You Rotten Prick, 
<P>
Who in hell needs "Ten ladies dancing??"  I can't imagine why I call these 
sluts "ladies."  They've been balling the pipers all night long.  Now the cows 
can't sleep and all the goddamn racket around here has given them diarrhea. 
My living room is a river of shit!  The Commisioner of Bldgs. has 
subpoenaed me to give cause why the building should not be condemned! 
<P>
I'm sicking the police on you, asshole!

Listen Fuckhead, 
<P>
What's with the "Eleven lords a leaping" on those maids and ladies???  Some 
of these poor broads will never walk again.  The pipers ravaged the maids, 
gang-banged the ladies, and now are committing sodomy on the cows.  All 23 
birds are dead.  They were trampled to death in the orgy.  I hope you're 
satisfied, you rotten vicious bastard!
