The mafia was looking for a new man to make weekly collections from all the 
private businesses that they were 'protecting'.  Feeling the heat from 
the police force, they decide to use a deaf person for this job ; if he 
were to get caught, he wouldn't be able to communicate to the police 
what he was doing. 
<P>
Well, on his first week, the deaf collector picks up over $40,000.  He gets 
greedy, decides to keep the money and stashes it in a safe place.  The mafia 
soon realizes that their collection is late, and sends some of their hoods 
after the deaf collector. 
<P>
The hoods find the deaf collector and ask him where the money is.  The 
deaf collector can't communicate with them, so the mafia drags the guy 
to an interpreter. 
<P>
The mafia hood says to the interpreter, "Ask him where da money is." 
The interpreter signs,"Where's the money?" 
<P>
The deaf replies, "I don't know what you're talking about." 
<P>
The interpreter tells the hood,"He says he doesn't know what you're 
talking about" 
<P>
The hood pulls out a .38 and places it in the ear of the deaf collector. 
"NOW ask him where the money is." 
<P>
The interpreter signs, "Where is the money?" 
<P>
The deaf replies, "The $40,000 is in a tree stump in Central Park." 
<P>
The interpreter's eyes light up and says to the hood, 
"He says he still doesn't know what you're talking about, and doesn't think 
you have the balls to pull the trigger." 
<P>
