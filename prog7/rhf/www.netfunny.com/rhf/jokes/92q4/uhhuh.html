                    SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING ON PRODUCTS
                                # 127748
                       Comestible Ingredient: "Uh-Huh"


"Uh-Huh": A psychochemical drug usually found in powder or syrup form. It
          is dark-brown to black in color. Main extract from the spiny
          North American Mid-Western plant called "unk-ha" by the local
          Indians. Latin name: ofelius likapepsis.

Approved by the FDA January 13th, 1983 to be used in the distribution of
carbonated drinks. Original purpose for filler, later used to enhace the
flavor of drinks over-thinned by costwise production.

On March 14th, 1992, Punkadyne Labratories, in accordance with FDA studies,
released its report on the long-term effects of the ingredients. The basic
results of the tests are presented here for public distribution. The results
of this test were used to provide leverage to ban the organic compound from
public consumption. The findings were conclusive, and the process is in
litagation.
 
Punkadyne Labratories tested pre-measrued doses on 500 Lawyers from the
Washington DC area. Lab rats were initially considered, but there are some
things a lab rat just simply won't do.

All test subjects were given straight 100% uh-huh mixed in with a martini.
Control groups were given a martini with an uh-huh look-alike, X7. All
subjects were kept in a natural enviroment, complete with ceiling mirrors
and volumes of legal paperwork to keep them company. The use of inflatable
women was restricted to keep the heart rate low, and was substituted with
Girl Scout magazines.

Results are being scrutinized, as some find the lawyer's response to be
confused with normal lawyer off-hour behavior.
