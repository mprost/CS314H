Third Year Noticeboard.

!--------

Friday, May 4, 1990.

Just a friendly reminder.  Please note that the last date for the
submission of continuous assessment essays is Friday May 18 1990.
Your essays should be handed to Maureen in the departmental
office on or before that day and a receipt obtained.

Friday, May 18, 1990.

It rather looks as though some third year students have not yet
handed in their continuous assessment essays to Maureen in the
departmental office.  The FINAL deadline for the submission of
these essays is TUESDAY MAY 22.

Generic Lecturer (Prof)

Tuesday, May 22, 1990.

One or two third year students have still not handed in their
continuous assessment essays to Maureen in the departmental
office.  The ABSOLUTE AND FINAL deadline for submission of these
essays is FRIDAY MAY 25.  You are advised that failure to submit
by this date may have implications for your final mark.

G. Lecturer (Professor)

Friday, May 25, 1990.

Listen.  You lot really are pushing your luck this year. I know
that some of you are relying on the soft-hearted liberals and
pusillanimous social workers in the department to vote down any
system of penalizing late submissions but you should note that we
failed to get a draconian punishment system through by only one
vote last year and that means with our new and highly
authoritarian external examiner on the committee this year you
could be in for a very nasty shock indeed. (How about THREE marks
off your total for every day late?  What d'you think of that, eh?)
So this is your ABSOLUTE AND FINAL AND ULTIMATE LAST CHANCE. 
Unless you get those bleeding essays in to Maureen by Monday
morning May 28 at 9.30am, I will do my damnedest to ensure that
there'll be no reason whatsoever for YOUR mother to show up on
this campus on Graduation Day.
GET MY DRIFT?

Professor G. Lecturer BA, MA, PhD.
