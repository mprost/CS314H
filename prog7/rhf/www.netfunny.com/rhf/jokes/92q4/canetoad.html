<PRE>
   Cane toads were introduced into Queensland (Australia), supposedly to help
   control the cane beetle population.  It seemed like a good idea: the only
   problem was that it didn't work (although your average cane toad will
   give a rat a good fight).   Queensland has been stuck with this poisonous
   insectivore, which has become an unofficial mascot of our state.  It's not
   that we're obsessed with them...

ANTHONY: I don't know why you guys have to make it so complicated. 
ANTHONY: Look I am just to death of seeing cane toads outside the front of
ANTHONY: the CS building everytime I come in ok.  So I need an old golf

DAVO: 
DAVO: Have you thought of the damage you could inflict on unsuspecting
DAVO: fellow human beings after they've been hit by a high velocity
DAVO: cane toad... Really Anthony ... I do hear that putting them in a
DAVO: freezer is a good way of killing them, So I suggest you hit them
DAVO: with a freezer. ( If nothing else it does a lot more damage. )
DAVO: 
DAVO: Davo.

FARRELL: 
FARRELL:  I think Anthony wants to kill the toads himself. Therefore <b>he</b> should
FARRELL: assemble below the window and catch it and take it to the toads himself
FARRELL:
FARRELL: BTW Anthony, what's wrong with a cricket bat? Why choose an elitist

ANTHONY: Nothing wrong with a cricket bat, in fact if anyone has an old cricket 
ANTHONY: bat I will gladly use it.  I have a confession to make, it is not just
ANTHONY: the toads outside the department that's giving trouble.  There are
ANTHONY: hundreds of toads outside our new house in Corinda.  Just the other
ANTHONY: night I used an old umbrella to kill one.  Boy, those things are hard
ANTHONY: to kill.  I hit it a few times but it refused to die.  Eventually I
ANTHONY: used the tip and went for his lungs.  He died, see I had to do it, my
ANTHONY: dog was coming and he would have tried to eat it.  Also I have no more
ANTHONY: room in my freezer :-).

RHYS: I should report you to the TLAQ (Toad Lover's Association of Queensland).
RHYS: Golf clubs, cricket bats and falling freezers are condoned in the charter
RHYS: of the TLAQ, because the toad still has a fighting chance.  But umbrella
RHYS: tips? That is just too cruel.  You are a sicko!  So what if your dog eats
RHYS: a toad and dies?  That's just natural selection at work.  But umbrellas
RHYS: are not natural.
RHYS:
RHYS: Help stamp out umbrellas in the war against toads!

DA: 
DA: Yes, and often even this doesn't kill them. I'll bet he wasn't there in the

ANTHONY: I recently moved from St Lucia to Corinda and I found a few
ANTHONY: pieces of pottery that I've made in high school.  I was thinking
ANTHONY: of throwing them out but some for them do look...well interesting.
ANTHONY: Come to my room and have a look if you are curious.  I will give

ADRIAN: 
ADRIAN: Why not use them on cane toads?  Depending on the weight of the
ADRIAN: "art objects" they could either be used as projectiles or for crushing.

ANTHONY: Yes, they were already at the low price of $2 a
ANTHONY: piece but now I am giving them away.  Yes, it is
ANTHONY: unbelievable that I am giving away such fine
ANTHONY: pieces but I have no room for them.  
ANTHONY: 
ANTHONY: Come to room 706 and inspect them for yourself.
ANTHONY: There are no hidden extras.  Think of the time when
ANTHONY: you wish you had a paper weight.  Think of the time
ANTHONY: when you want to throw something at your dog to
ANTHONY: stop it from barking.  Summer is coming and you
ANTHONY: need something to drop on cane toads.
