</PRE>(AP) So Mr. Glenn, tell us about your upcoming flight. 
<P>
(Glenn) When I was young, they didn't have no Speece Shuttle.  We had 
rockets made of cast iron, with fuming acid and nitroglycerin for fuel. 
They would blow up for no reason most of the time, but we liked them. 
<P>
And we didn't have no navigation computers.  If it couldn't be worked 
out on a pocket sliderule, it wasn't worth calculating.  We only flew 
by the seat of the pants.  That's why we always landed in the Atlantic 
Ocean.  Our navigation was good enough we never hit the Pacific by 
mistake.  Automated flight controls, my eye.  You haven't felt anything 
until you climb on top of one of those babies and punch the gas. 
<P>
And we didn't have no shirtsleeve atmosphere.  They just fed vapor from 
the rocket fuel directly into our space suits.  And attitude adjustment 
was something that was done on the ground, before you blasted off. 
<P>
In my time, we didn't have no La-Z-Boy reclining chairs for liftoff. 
There were no elevators to the top of the missile, either.  You just lit 
the fuse, climbed a rope ladder to the top, climbed into a 50 gallon 
drum, sat on a milking stool, bolted on the hatch, and waited for the 
ride.  It was dangerous, cramped, noisy and uncomfortable, but it was 
our only space program and we LIKED IT. 
<P>
(AP) Thank you, Mr. Glenn. 
<P>
