<BR>'Twas a Night Before Crisis"<BR>
<P>
'Twas the night before crisis,<BR>
And behind White House doors,<BR>
Not a creature was stirring,<BR>
Especially Al Gore.<BR>
<P>
The interns were nestled,<BR>
Dressed in their berets,<BR>
In hopes that Saint Bubba<BR>
Would come out to play.<BR>
<P>
When on the East Lawn,<BR>
There arose such a clatter,<BR>
Even Sam Donaldson<BR>
Lost control of his bladder.<BR>
<P>
Away to our TVs<BR>
We flew like a flash,<BR>
There's a special report,<BR>
And it's pre-emptying M*A*S*H!<BR>
<P>
And what to our wondering<BR>
Eyes should appear,<BR>
But a homely lil' troll,<BR>
With tapes for us to hear.<BR>
<P>
With a K-Mart bought blazer,<BR>
And a bad frizzy 'do,<BR>
And a tale to be told--<BR>
To me, and to you.<BR>
<P>
On the chair! On the carpet!<BR>
On the Oval Office desk!<BR>
With a chubby young intern,<BR>
Who was all eyes and chest.<BR>
<P>
The Pres had been careless,<BR>
Indeed, dumb and dumber.<BR>
Now the whole world knew<BR>
Bubba had gotten a hummer.<BR>
<P>
And Monica Lewinsky<BR>
Emerged from the rubble,<BR>
If she'd just kept her mouth shut,<BR>
We'd not have all this trouble.<BR>
<P>
And thus set in motion,<BR>
A whole web o' spiders,<BR>
With pundits galore,<BR>
And "White House insiders."<BR>
<P>
You ask, "Who would care<BR>
About Bill and his penis?"<BR>
Republican Ken Starr,<BR>
And he's armed with subpoenas!<BR>
<P>
More rapid than eagles,<BR>
Process servers, they flew!<BR>
"Here's one for you!<BR>
And for you! And you, too!"<BR>
<P>
"Now Jordan! Now Graham!<BR>
Is there anyone else?!?<BR>
Let's subpoena the lawyers!<BR>
And Bubba himself!!"<BR>
<P>
"We want you to tell us<BR>
About Bill's private life,<BR>
And anyone he sleeps with,<BR>
'cept, of course, his wife."<BR>
<P>
And many months later,<BR>
After long we've all suffered,<BR>
Let's examine more closely<BR>
Just what Starr's uncovered.<BR>
<P>
We've learned "Little Bill"<BR>
Has a mind of his own,<BR>
And-horror of horrors-<BR>
He likes to get blown!<BR>
<P>
A funny fact surfaced,<BR>
After 40 million bucks:<BR>
Seems most people don't care<BR>
Just who Clinton, er, makes love to.<BR>
<P>
The economy's great,<BR>
And shows no signs of slowing.<BR>
Hell, we hope Ms. Lewinsky<BR>
NEVER stops blowing!<BR>
<P>
Now the public's grown weary.<BR>
Will this sleaze never end?<BR>
We just want to get back<BR>
To "E.R.," and to "Friends."<BR>
<P>
Now Monica, Linda--<BR>
And Ken Starr, you all suck-<BR>
Get the hell off my TV,<BR>
Your 15 minutes are up.<BR>
