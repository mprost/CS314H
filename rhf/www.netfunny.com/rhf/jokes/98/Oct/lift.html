</PRE>A group of third, fourth and fifth graders accompanied by two female 
teachers went on a field trip to the local race track to learn about 
thoroughbred horses and the supporting industry. 
<P>
During the tour some of the children wanted to go to the toilet so it was 
decided that the girls would go with one teacher and the boys would go with 
the other. 
<P>
As the teacher assigned to the boys waited outside the men's toilet, one of 
the boys came out and told her he couldn't reach the urinal.  Having no 
choice, she went inside and began hoisting the little boys up by their 
armpits, one by one. 
<P>
As she lifted one, she couldn't help but notice that he was unusually 
well-endowed for an elementary school child.  "I guess you must be in the 
fifth,"  she said. 
<P>
"No ma'am" he replied, "I'm in the seventh, riding Silver Arrow.  Thanks for 
the lift anyhow."
