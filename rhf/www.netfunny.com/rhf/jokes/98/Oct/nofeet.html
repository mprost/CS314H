</PRE>I was travelling home on the train from Newcastle 
to Glasgow on Sunday and I was sitting with a 
group of people who, through no fault of their 
own, had recently been travelling in the first 
class carriage. They told me of this incident 
which ocurred while they were living the high life 
with their complimentary coffee and biscuits. 
Aparrently there had been a woman on the train 
with a small dog. When the ticket inspector came 
round he told her she'd have to buy a ticket for 
her dog. Understandably galled, she replied that 
if she was paying for a ticket for the dog, the 
dog would be entitled to a seat of it's own. The 
ticket collector graciously agreed but on one 
condition; he pointed to the sign by the window 
and said, "just as long as he keeps his feet off 
the seat."
