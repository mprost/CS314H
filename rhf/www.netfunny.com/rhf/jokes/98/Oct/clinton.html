</PRE>What follows are the latest entries in the Clinton file.  These are jokes 
which are funny, but which didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post 
such a digest whenever I have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly 
selective readers will probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to 
killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in the title - ed.

Gennifer Flowers was asked recently if her sexual relationship with Bill<BR>
Clinton was similar to the one he had with Monica Lewinsky.  She replied,<BR>
"Close, but no cigar."<BR>

Reading the Starr Report has actually increased my belief in the<BR>
President's honesty.<BR>

inhale.<BR>

Clinton's first thought when reading Starr's report:<BR>
<P>
"Imagine how much worse it could have been had they<BR>
discovered that the cigar was a Havana."<BR>

I was talking with some friends about what Clinton might do if he's<BR>
asked to pay the $44million in legal fees racked up during this scandal,<BR>
then we hit on it:<BR>
<P>
Auction the Cigar.<BR>

<H1 align=center>Creative uses for tobacco products (original)</H1>
<P>
In light of the recent presidential scandal, I've come up with an idea<BR>
for a new brand of cigar featuring an irregularly shaped end:  The "El<BR>
Presidente" - Ribbed for her pleasure.  :)<BR>

<P>
Maybe Clinton has been extremely clairvoyant when it comes to protecting<BR>
himself and limiting access to information about his private life.  After<BR>
all, by passing the Communications Decency Act, he could have forced the<BR>
goverment to shut down all websites carrying copies of the Starr report,<BR>
right?<BR>
