<BR>The 8 Worst Convenience Foods<BR>
By PENMART10@aol.com<BR>
<P>
</PRE>8. Meeter's Kraut Juice (Stokely USA): Yes, that's sauerkraut juice, 
which is even worse than it sounds. The taste and smell can be a bit, well, 
harsh, but KJ is reputed by its fans to have certain medicinal benefits (as a 
source of vitamin C, cure for intestinal bugs, etc.), which adds up to a 
classic case of the cure being worse than the disease. 
<P>
7. Guycan Corned Mutton with Juices Added (Bedessee Imports): The best thing 
about this Uruguayan canned good is the very pouty-looking sheep on the 
package label--he seems to be saying, "Go on, eat  me already." The 
second-best thing is the presence of both "cooked mutton" and "mutton" in 
the ingredients listing, which would seem to have all the mutton bases 
covered. 
<P>
6. Armour Pork Brains in Milk Gravy (Dial Corp.): If you're really looking 
to clog up those arteries in a hurry, you'll be pleased to learn that a 
single serving of pork brains has 1,170 percent of our recommended daily 
cholesterol intake. All the more ingenious, then, that the label on this 
product helpfully features a recipe for brains and scrambled eggs. 
<P>
5. Sweet Sue Canned Whole Chicken (Sweet Sue Kitchens, Inc.): From its size 
(think growth-impaired Cornish hen) to its overall appearance (it's stewed 
in a quivering mass of aspic goop), this product may change forever your 
idea of what constitutes a chicken. Gives new meaning to the old line about 
meat "falling off the  bone." 
<P>
4. Musk Life Savers (Nestle Confectionery): You may think musk is a scent, 
but over in Australia, they think it's a candy flavor. A candy flavor that 
tastes disturbingly like raw meat, to be precise. But what did you expect 
from a country where everyone happily consumes Vegemite? 
<P>
3. Blind Robins Smoked Ocean Herring (recently discontinued by Bar Food 
Products): Possibly the world's most bizarre prepackaged tavern snack. 
Interestingly, the product's titular robin isn't actually blind, he's 
blindfolded--the better, presumably, to avoid looking at these heavily 
salted herring strips, which look like giant slugs. 
<P>
2. Kylmaenen Reindeer Pate` (Kylmaenen Oy): This Finnish canned good may 
not be particulary tasty, but at least it answers the age-old question of 
why Rudolph was so eager for that safe, steady job on Santa's sleigh 
team--he didn't want to end up a cracker spread. 
<P>
1. Tengu Clam Jerky (Tengu Co.): Nothing you've ever consumed can prepare 
you for the horror that is clam jerky. Still, this product does score a sort 
of conceptual coup: If you're the sort who's always found raw clams too 
slimy and gelatinous for your taste, these dried, shriveled mollusks will 
help you dislike clams on a whole new level.
