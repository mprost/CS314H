</PRE>Every November I send donations to various organizations. 
With each I send a letter something like this year's: 
<P>
<BR>&gt;Dear friends:<BR>
<P>
&gt;Yours is a worthy cause, to which I am happy to contribute.<BR>
&gt;However, I make donations only in November, and it bothers<BR>
&gt;me when much of my donation is eaten up flooding me with<BR>
&gt;requests for more donations.  It bothers me even more when<BR>
&gt;I get called by telephone.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;So, please do us both a favor and don't send me a lot of<BR>
&gt;funds solicitations.  Send my one in October or November,<BR>
&gt;and you'll get just as much money--maybe more--as<BR>
&gt;you'll get if you write more often.  If you write too<BR>
&gt;often, I'll assume you just spend money soliciting more<BR>
&gt;money, and I'll stop sending you any.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;  If anyone from your organization ever phones me, for<BR>
&gt;  any reason whatsoever, you'll never hear from me again.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Sorry to be so harsh, but I figure it's best if we all<BR>
&gt;understand each other.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks, and keep up the good work.<BR>
<P>
</PRE>A couple of weeks ago one of these organizations did call me. 
My sweetie took the call, and as soon as the caller identified 
himself, she told him, "Oh, it's a good thing you didn't reach 
him: he HATES getting these phone calls." 
<P>
This weekend I got the following letter: 
<P>
&gt;Dear Mr. Wall, 
&gt; 
&gt;Thank you for your recent gift to &lt;name withheld&gt;, and for 
&gt;your support over the years. 
&gt; 
&gt;Your letter raised a question: are we complying with your 
&gt;request of no phone calls, and once-a-year mail solicitations 
&gt;each fall? If not, I would appreciate hearing about it.  I 
&gt;tried calling to make this inquiry, but someone hung up on 
&gt;me before I could explain why I was calling. 
&gt; 
&gt;					Sincerely, 
<P>
