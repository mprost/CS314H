</PRE>Teenagers are ALWAYS Hungry 
<P>
As you might have seen, we bicyclists tend to ride in groups. Our 
particular group is comprised mostly of late and over 40's types tending 
towards a 50's group with several septegenarians in the bunch. 
<P>
Bicycling allows us to work off the excess energy that might otherwise 
be used in more negative ways towards our unworthy, ungrateful and 
unresponsive children. In a group we can discuss our problems and get 
suggestions and advice from those with more experience. This allows us 
to keep an even temper when dealing with our children's, uh, requests 
(No, dear, you cannot have a rhinoseros even if you DO promise to keep 
it in your room and clean up after it.) 
<P>
During the last ride the subject was teenagers and their appetites. Most 
agreed that teenagers would eat anything, anywhere and at any time. Some 
were concerned that such appetites always made it hard to judge when you 
should feed them because they were always grazing. 
<P>
John Carroll, the veteran parent of six children, told us of his method 
for judging the true hunger of teenagers. 
<P>
"I would hold up a piece of cold, cooked brocoli and if they were 
jumping and snapping at it I figured they were hungry enough to be fed." 
<P>
