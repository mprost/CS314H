<P>
</PRE>Two young engineers fresh out of college put in applications for an 
engineering position with a company.  Both clients having the exact same 
qualifications, they were asked to take a test by the Department manager 
to help decide which one to hire.  Upon completion of the test, both 
applicants had missed only one of the questions.   After reviewing the 
tests, the manager decided to speak with the losing applicant first: 
<P>
Manager: Thanks for your interest, but we have decided to give the 
position to the other applicant. 
<P>
Applicant: Why would you do that?  We both got 9 questions correct - why 
choose the other applicant over me?! 
<P>
Manager: We have made our decision not based upon the correct answers, 
but on the question you missed. 
<P>
Applicant: And just how would one incorrect answer be better than the 
other? 
<P>
Manager: Simple.  The other applicant put answered "I don't know" for 
question 5.  Your answer was "Neither do I." 
<P>
