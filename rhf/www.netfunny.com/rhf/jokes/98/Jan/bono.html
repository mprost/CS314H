</PRE>And so it begins...  What follows are the better of the one-liners regarding 
the death of Sonny Bono.  These are jokes which are funny, but which didn't 
really warrant posting separately.  I post such a digest whenever I have 
enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly selective readers will probably 
not enjoy the digests, and may want to killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in 
the title - ed. 
<P>
Particularly sensitive readers will not want to read this.

</PRE>A comment from Stefan Jones, SeJ@aol.com 
<P>
<BR>&gt; This morning's NPR news's coverage of Sonny Bono's death stated that the<BR>
&gt; former singer "had a great impact on the entertainment world and politics,"<BR>
&gt; to which I mentally added, "not to mention on a tree."<BR>

&gt;Subject: To ski or not to ski<BR>
<P>
</PRE>The recent deaths of Michael Kennedy and Sonny Bono have led to 
concerns that more mandatory safety regulations are needed on the ski 
slopes. 
<P>
I disagree. I think that all that's needed on the slopes are more 
politicians.

&gt;Subject: Joke Submission<BR>
<P>
</PRE>With Sony Bono's death our country has lost both a statesman and an 
entertainer.  Although on the entertainment side, the only impression he 
could do was Michael Kennedy.
