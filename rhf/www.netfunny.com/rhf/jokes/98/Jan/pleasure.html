</PRE>An Englishman, a Scotsman, and an Irishman are all to give speeches to the 
Deaf Society. All are keen to make an impression on their audience. The 
Englishman goes first and to the surprise of his colleagues starts by rubbing 
first his chest and then his groin. 
<P>
When he finishes the Scotsman and Irishman ask him what he was doing.  "Well" 
he explained" By rubbing my chest I indicated breasts and thus Ladies and by 
rubbing my groin I indicated balls and thus Gentlemen. So 
my speech started "Ladies and Gentlemen." 
<P>
On his way up to the podium the Scotsman thought to himself I'll go one 
better than that English bastard, and he started his speech by making an antler 
symbol with his fingers above his head before also rubbing his chest and his 
groin. When he finished his colleagues asked what he was doing.  "Well" he 
explained" By imitating antlers and then rubbing my chest and groin I was 
starting my speech by saying Deer Ladies and Gentlemen." 
<P>
On his way up to the podium the Irishman thought to himself I'll go one 
further than those mainland bastards and started his speech by making an 
antler symbol above his head, rubbing his chest, and then his groin, and then 
masturbating furiously. 
<P>
When he finished his colleagues asked him what he was doing. "Well" he 
explained," by imitating antlers, rubbing my chest and then my groin and then 
masturbating I was starting my speech by saying Deer Ladies and 
Gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure......."
