</PRE>And the Clinton jokes keep rolling in. 
<P>
These are jokes which are funny, but which didn't really warrant posting 
separately.  I post such a digest whenever I have enough entries to warrant 
it.  Particularly selective readers will probably not enjoy the digests, and 
may want to killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in the title - ed. 
<P>
<BR>=====<BR>
&gt;From: trailrnr@erols.com (Michael McCumber)<BR>
&gt;Subject: Suggestion to Clinton<BR>
<P>
</PRE>If President Clinton practiced safe, monogamous sex, he wouldn't be worried 
about aides. 
<P>
<BR>=====<BR>
&gt;From: rdpd20@email.sps.mot.com (Alfie Phillips)<BR>
&gt;Organization: Motorola, High Perfomance Embedded Systems Division<BR>
&gt;Subject: Clarification<BR>
<P>
</PRE>I heard that Clinton was on the Conan show and was quoted to say: 
<P>
<BR>"I didn't tell her to lie in the disposition."<BR>
"I told her to lay in that position."<BR>
<P>
=====<BR>
&gt;From: jlp2@tiac.net (John L. Pearlman)<BR>
&gt;Subject: The Washington scene<BR>
<P>
</PRE>It occurred to me that for a young woman, taking a job in the White 
House, these days, could be thought of as joining the "Piece Corps." 
<P>
<BR>=====<BR>
&gt;Subject: Clinton sex scandal<BR>
&gt;From: sbalzac@ibm.net (Stephen R. Balzac)<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Let's see if I have this straight... people are upset with Clinton for 
allegedly doing to one person what George Bush and Ronald Reagan did to 
the entire country.  Isn't envy a terrible thing? 
<P>
<BR>=====<BR>
&gt;From: jms4@po.CWRU.Edu (James M. Sohr)<BR>
&gt;Subject: Self serving policy?<BR>
<P>
</PRE>While browsing the White House's web page looking 
for info about the latest scandal, I knew I had succeeded when 
I found the following header at the top of the page under the 
current press releases: 
<P>
"The White House at Work:  Increasing Support for Family 
Planning" 
<P>
Ah, well I guess that's one way to put it... 
<P>
<BR>=====<BR>
&gt;From: dcalhoun@rockisland.com (Dave Calhoun)<BR>
&gt;Subject: And the public says...<BR>
<P>
</PRE>A recent poll of 2000 women asked the question:  Would you sleep with Bill 
Clinton? 
<P>
94% responded "Never again" 
<P>
[Heard on KLSY radio in Seattle] 
<P>
<BR>=====<BR>
&gt;From: ngross@sonic.net (Neal Gross)<BR>
&gt;Subject: Kaczynski<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Prosecutors have agreed to spare Ted Kaczynski's life, in exchange for his 
testimony of having had an affair with President Clinton.
