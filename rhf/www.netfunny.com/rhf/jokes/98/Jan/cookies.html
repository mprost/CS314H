</PRE>The Department of Commerce, just in time for the Holiday season, 
sent out an advisory on the gift policy to all its employees.  So, when 
Paul baked cookies and left them out for the folks at the Storm Prediction 
Center (SPC), he had a problem ...

Merry Christmas...Happy New Year....Happy Holidays.... 
<P>
As a result of the well intended and conceived NOAA/Dept. of Commerce 
e-mail on gift giving, you may need to be aware of the following 
restrictions regarding these cookies. 
<P>
Since we must relate all "gifts" to a monetary equivalent and since the 
cookies herein are presented as "a gift" to all SPC employees, we must 
determine a cost per cookie.  Since I am unsure the true value of my 
time or the exact amount of money spent on ingredients for each cookie, 
I am estimating a value of $5.05 per cookie. 
<P>
Thus, if you are a "friend or relative of mine" you may consume up to 
three (3) cookies.  More than three cookies would perhaps "raise a 
question."  If you are unsure of your "friend/relative" status, best 
to check with me first. 
<P>
If you have any business or dealing with me (like requesting data, 
needing scripts written, etc.) and are not a "friend or relative," I'm 
sorry, you are ineligible to receive cookies.  If you have recently 
done business with me you probably don't want to eat any cookies...it's 
unclear what the statute of limitations is. 
<P>
Also, if asked, you must be prepared to provide a written history or proof 
that gifts (of this same value) have been exchanged between us in the 
past.  If you are a relative, you may be required to present ID.  Also, 
any acceptance of cookies between any of my "friends or relatives" must 
require a "mutual exchange of cookies" or I may be forced to turn you in. 
<P>
If there are any foreign persons (i.e. non-US citizens) visiting or 
temporarily working at the SPC they are NOT allowed to consume any 
cookies.  I'm plum out of all CD 342 forms and wouldn't be able to report 
the return gift appropriately. 
<P>
If you are a supervisor of me, you are not entitled to any cookies.  Also, 
you must check with Peggy to see if your salary is higher or lower than 
mine.  If it is higher, I'm sorry NO COOKIES FOR YOU!  If it's lower, you 
are allowed to consume.  There is some gray area here, better be safe and 
not eat more than one cookie as two cookies would exceed a $10 gift. 
<P>
You must sign for all cookies taken from the tray.  You should also 
provide     your SSN in case I have to file a W2. 
<P>
I'm not having a holiday party, but if I were, nobody would be invited. 
I'm not sure I can figure out whom I'm allowed to invite!  There may be 
some conflict of interest between supervisors who attended the NSEA 
holiday party on Tuesday....those who may be implicated should check their 
status and get their stores in order. 
<P>
Happy Holidays...
