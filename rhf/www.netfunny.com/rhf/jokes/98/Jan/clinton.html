</PRE>You people sure don't waste any time...  These are jokes which are funny, 
but which didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post such a digest 
whenever I have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly selective 
readers will probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to killfile RHF 
jokes with "Digest" in the title - ed.

performance."
