</PRE>Special News Report: 
<P>
Although there have been some reports that the semen found on Monica 
Lewinsky's dress has been identified as President Clinton's, some experts are 
claiming that the semen could not possibly have come from the President. 
<P>
Robert Glass, a noted ballistics expert, claims that given the position of the 
President, and the position of Ms. Lewinsky, that it is not possible that the 
President's semen landed on her dress. "The semen would have to have turned 
180 degrees in mid-air!" explained Mr. Glass. "In effect, it would have to be 
magic semen." 
<P>
Mr. Glass, and other experts, contend that there must have been a second 
mystery semen-shooter, standing behind the President. Several White House 
aides claim that they saw a man during the time period in question standing 
behind a potted plant in the oval office. Asked why they didn't report him, 
the aides explained that they assumed that the man was a gardener, there to 
water the plants. "He was holding something in his hand." explained a White 
House secretary. "It looked like a hose." 
<P>
Democrats are now saying that the President has possibly been framed by a vast 
right-wing conspiracy, and are demanding a new investigation.  Ken Starr is 
outraged by these speculations, claiming that his report is accurate, and that 
there was a lone semen shooter in the White House. "We have extensively 
investigated this incident, and have come to the conclusion that Bill Clinton 
acted alone in the shooting." explained Mr. Starr. 
<P>
Yet, not every one is satisfied with the Starr Report. "Some one wanted to see 
that dress get stained." says Bob Long, a friend of the Clintons. "And now, 
the government is trying to cover it up."
