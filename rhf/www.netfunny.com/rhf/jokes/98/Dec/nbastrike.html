</PRE>THE NBA PLAYER ADOPTION PROGRAM NEEDS YOU! 
<P>
With an NBA player's strike against the team owners looming, now is the 
time for us to show the world just how much we care. It's just not right. 
Hundreds of basketball players in our very own country are living at or 
just below the seven-figure salary level! Atrocious! And, as if that 
weren't bad enough, they will be deprived of pay for several 
weeks-possibly a whole year-as a result of the strike. But now you can 
help!  For about two thousand dollars a day-that's less than the cost of a 
large screen projection TV-you can help a basketball player remain 
economically viable during his time of need. 
<P>
Two thousand dollars a day may not seem like a lot of money to you, but to 
a basketball player it could mean the difference between a vacation spent 
golfing in Florida or a Mediterranean cruise.  For you, two thousand 
dollars is nothing more than three months rent or mortgage payments. But 
to a basketball player, two thousand dollars a day will almost replace his 
salary. 
<P>
Your commitment of two thousand dollars a day will enable a player to buy 
that home entertainment center, trade in the year-old Lexus for a new 
Ferrari, or enjoy a weekend in Rio. 
<P>
"HOW WILL I KNOW I'M HELPING?" 
<P>
Each month, you will receive a complete financial report on the player you 
sponsor.  Detailed information about his stocks, bonds, 401(k), real 
estate, and other investment holdings will be mailed to your home. You'll 
also get information on how he plans to invest the $5 million lump sum he 
will receive upon retirement.  Plus upon signing up for this program, you 
will receive a photo of the player (unsigned).  Put the photo on your 
refrigerator to remind you of other peoples' suffering. 
<P>
"HOW WILL HE KNOW I'M HELPING" 
<P>
Your basketball player will be told that he has a SPECIAL FRIEND who just 
wants to help in a time of need.  Although the player won't know your 
name, he will be able to make collect calls to your home via a special 
operator just in case additional funds are needed for unexpected expenses. 
<P>
Simply fill out the form below. 
<P>
___YES, I want to help! 
<P>

</PRE><P>
</PRE>Please charge the account listed below $2,054.79 per day for a reserve 
player or starter for the duration of the strike.  Please send me a 
picture of the player I have sponsored, along with a team logo and my very 
own NBA Players Association badge to wear proudly on my lapel. 
<P>
<PRE>    [ ] MasterCard     [ ] Visa   [ ] American Express 
    [ ] DiscoverCard              [ ] Diner's Club

        Your Name: __________________________ 
        Telephone Number:  __________________________ 
        Account Number: __________________________ Exp.Date:_________ 
        Signature:  __________________________ 
</PRE><P>
</PRE>Mail completed form to NBA Players Association or call 1-888-TOOMUCH now 
to enroll by phone.  (Children under 18 must have parental approval.) 
<P>
Note:  Sponsors are not permitted to contact the player they have 
sponsored, either in person or by other means including, but not limited 
to, telephone calls, letters, e-mail, or third parties.  Keep in mind that 
the basketball player you have sponsored will be much too busy enjoying 
his free time, thanks to your generous donations.  Oh yes, contributions 
are not tax-deductible. 
<P>
