</PRE>A military truism: 
<P>
All officers can be categorized by 2 paired attributes: energetic/lazy 
and smart/stupid. 
<P>
The energetic/smart officer is often referred to as "high speed, low 
drag."  They are the hard chargers who will either go far or screw up 
spectacularly.  A commander is lucky to have such an officer as long as 
they can control them just enough to keep then from crashing and 
burning. 
<P>
The lazy/smart officer is a pearl of great price.  They will never try 
to make anything happen that is not already on their plate UNLESS they 
spot a problem that might make their life more difficult.  They will nip 
such problems in the bud.  Every job they have will be easier when they 
leave that it was when they arrived. 
<P>
The lazy/stupid officer can be useful for the routine jobs that aren't 
very demanding but still need to be done.  Put them under the 
supervision of an experienced and competent sergeant. 
<P>
The energetic/stupid officer is a viper at the breast of any command. 
They mean well. Catastrophe follows in their wake.  They will volunteer 
for a suicide mission.  Find one for them. 
<P>
