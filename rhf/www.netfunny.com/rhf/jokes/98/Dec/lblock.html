</PRE>This is a true story told to me by a district attorney who asked not to 
be named.  It happened at a Santa Monica Beach around 1997. 
<P>
The district attorney was walking his dog late at night on a deserted 
beach.  Coming toward him from the other direction was a rough looking 
man whom the D.A. recognized as a career gang member who he had sent up 
to San Quentin for 10 years on an assault and robbery charge.  The 
ex-felon was a big man covered with tattoos.  The D.A. was of medium 
height, with a paunchy stomach, balding, with glasses, and looked more 
like an accountant than a high-powered D.A. 
<P>
As the gang member approached, he was scrutinizing the D.A. carefully. 
He stopped in front of him and said in a tough voice, "Hey, I know you!" 
<P>
The D.A. answered in a low growl, "Yeah, well I know you too." 
<P>
The gang member said, "So where from?" 
<P>
The D.A. snarled, "L-block, San Quentin." 
<P>
The gang member's face changed completely. 
<P>
"Yeah, bro'?" he asked sympathetically.  "So how's it going?" 
<P>
"How the fuck do you think it's going?" the D.A. snarled with a grimace. 
<P>
The gang member slapped the D.A. on the back and said, "Hang in there, 
bro'" and went on his way. 
<P>
