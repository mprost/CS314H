</PRE>I've digested a number of the (so-called) quickies that I've received 
regarding the latest Clinton and Iraq brou-hah-hahs.  These are jokes 
which are funny, but which didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post 
such a digest whenever I have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly 
selective readers will probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to 
killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in the title - ed. 
<P>

Overheard at a meeting this morning: 
<P>
"Only two more bombing days until Ramadan!"

&gt;Subject: Cruise Missile Accuracy 
<P>
(Baghdad) After reports that a cruise missile destined 
for a military target in Iraq landed on a border town in 
Iran, US military sources have announced a change 
to the stated accuracy of cruise missiles, from 
"20 yards" to "one letter."

&gt;Subject: House Unamerican Activities Committee reconstituted 
<P>
Congress has reconstituted its infamous House Unamerican Activities 
Committee, but there have been a few changes.  For instance, the 
notorious question faced by hostile witnesses has been ammended: 
<P>
    Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party, 
    or of any organization (except the Republican party) dedicated to 
    the overthrow of the government of the United States of America?

&gt;Subject: Clinton's views on trial 
<P>
Clinton's sure he'll win his trial in the senate. 
<P>
After all he's always been a man without conviction and he has no intention 
of changing now!

&gt;Subject: The Pinochet Stratagem? 
<P>
British diplomacy has at last come up with a solution 
to the Iraq crisis ... 
<P>
... Saddam Hussein has been invited to London for a 
medical check-up.

&gt;Subject: Looking for the bright side.... 
<P>
It's a rather traumatic week in US politics. Now we likely 
wonder, "When will it all be over....?" 
<P>
But looking for a bright side, I suddenly realised: 
<P>
	The Senate is in effect "The Court"... 
<P>
	The Senators are the jurors. 
<P>
	The Chief Justice is the Judge. 
	 
	During the trial, the jurors do NOT talk; they listen. 
<P>
	Further, the jurors can not talk to the press either. 
<P>
I could REALLY enjoy this part... How long can we drag it out.....?

<P>
A: Foreign Ambassador

&gt;Subject: New Gulf Conflict 
<P>
The government has dubbed the new conflict "Operation Desert Fox," but  
the folks here are calling it the "Missiles for Monica" program.

&gt;Subject: CNN said about Clinton.......... 
<P>
Well ladies and gentlemen, by now you have heard that we are once again at war 
with Iraq. This just seems to add to the difficulties of our nation with 
impeachment looming for the president. So it seems that Bill Clinton is caught 
between Iraq and a hard on. 
<P>

&gt;Subject: bill clinton 
<P>
Bill Clinton has found a way to get even with Saddam.  He is appointing 
Ken Starr ambassador to Iraq.

&gt;Subject: Impeachment Trial Closing Arguments 
<P>
As the United States prepares for the impeachment trial of Bill 
Clinton, I wonder if the President's legal strategy could lead to 
Johnny Cochrane addressing the U.S. Senate, repeating over and over, 
<P>
        "If the cigar doesn't fit, you must acquit!" 
<P>

&gt;Subject: Clinton/Livingston 
<P>
Bob Livingston on his resignation: 
"I'd rather have a downturn to ignomy 
 than an intern go down on me!" 
<P>
