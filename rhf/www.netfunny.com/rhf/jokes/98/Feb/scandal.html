</PRE>Turmoil rocked Heaven this morning as allegations arose that God 
had had an affair with a former worshiper.  The scandal was 
begun when a 21 year old woman, known only as Mary, claimed that 
she had given birth to God's "only son" last week in a barn in 
the hamlet of Bethlehem.  Sources close to Mary claim that she 
"had loved God for a long time," that she was constantly talking 
about her relationship with God, and that she was "thrilled to 
have had his child."  In a press conference this morning, God issued 
a vehement denial, saying that "No sexual relationship existed" 
and that "the facts of this story will come out in time, verily." 
<P>
Independent counsel Kenneth Beazulbub immediately filed a brief 
with the Justice department to expand his investigation to cover 
questions of whether any commandments may have been broken, and 
whether God had illegally funneled laundered money to his 
illegitimate child through three foreign operatives identified 
only as the "Wise Men."  Beazulbub has issued subpoenas to 
several angels who are rumored to have acted as go-betweens in 
the affair.  Critics have pointed out that these allegations 
have little to do with the charges that Beazulbub was originally 
appointed to investigate, that God had created large-scale 
flooding in order to cover up evidence of a failed land deal. 
In recent months, Beazulbub's investigation has already been 
expanded to cover questions surrounding the large number of 
locusts that plagued God's political opponents in the last 
election, as well as to claims that the giveaway of a parcel of 
public land in Promised County to a Jewish special interest 
group was quid pro quo for political contributions.  Some 
journalists have speculated that the destruction of the cities 
of Sodom and Gommorah may have been to divert attention away 
from God's political problems. 
<P>
If these allegations prove to be true, this could be a huge blow 
to God's career, much of which has been spent crusading for 
stricter moral standards and harsher punishments for wrongdoers. 
Known for his fiery oratory, God has sometimes been criticized 
for his political theatrics, as when he introduced the bill he 
styled "The Ten Commandments" by appearing as a burning 
bush on the Senate floor.  Regardless of the outcome of the 
investigation, however, it is unlikely that a sitting God can be 
removed from power.  Most legal scholars are in agreement that 
indicting God would constitute taking His name in vain.
