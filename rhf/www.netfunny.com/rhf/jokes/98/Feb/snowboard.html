</PRE>Here are the better of the quickies I've received regarding Canadian 
snowboarder Ross Rebagliati, who was temporarily stripped of his gold medal 
after testing positive for marijuana.  These are jokes which are funny, but 
which didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post such a digest 
whenever I have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly selective 
readers will probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to killfile RHF 
jokes with "Digest" in the title - ed.

</PRE>"Olympic snowboarding gold medalist Ross Rebagliati today was stripped of 
his medal when he tested positive for marijuana.  Apparently, IOC 
officials became suspicious when they found out he was a snowboarder."

<P>
</PRE>Rumor has it that the International Olympic Committee first suspected 
something was amiss during the medal ceremony, when the guy tried to rip 
the Maple Leaf off the flag--and smoke it. 
<P>
And then when they played the anthem and he started singing "O 
Cannabis...," the jig was really up.

</PRE>Did you hear the motto of the Canadian Olympic Snowboarding team? 
<P>
"Stronger, faster, higher."
