</PRE>It's the Spring of 1957 and Bobby goes to pick up his date. He's a 
pretty hip guy with his own car. When he goes to the front door, the 
girl's father answers and invites him in. "Carrie's not ready yet, so 
why don't you have a seat?," he says. "That's cool" says Bobby. 
Carrie's father asks Bobby what they're planning to do. Bobby replies 
politely that they will probably just go to the soda shop or a movie. 
Carrie's father responds "why don't you two go out and screw? I hear 
all the kids are doing it." 
<P>
Naturally, this comes as quite a surprise to Bobby and therefore he 
asks 
Carrie's Dad to repeat it. "Yeah," says Carries father, "Carrie really 
likes to screw;  she'll screw all night if we let her!" Well, this just 
made Bobby's eyes light up, and his plans for the evening were 
beginning 
to look pretty good. 
<P>
A few minutes later, Carrie comes downstairs in her little poodle skirt 
and announces that she's ready to go. Almost breathless with 
anticipation, Bobby escorts his date out the front door. About 20 
minutes 
later, Carrie rushes back into the house, slams the door behind her, 
and 
screams at her father:"DAMMIT DADDY! IT'S CALLED THE TWIST!!!"
