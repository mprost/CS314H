<P>
</PRE>Four married guys go golfing. During the 4th hole the following 
conversation took place: 
<P>
First Guy: "You have no idea what I had to do to be able to 
come out golfing this weekend. I had to promise my wife that 
I will paint every room in the house next weekend." 
<P>
Second Guy: "That's nothing, I had to promise my wife that I 
will build her a new deck for the pool." 
<P>
Third Guy: "Man, you both have it easy! I had to promise my 
wife that I will remodel the kitchen for her." 
<P>
They continue to play the hole when they realized that the 
fourth guy has not said a word. So they ask him.  "You haven't 
said anything about what you had to do to be able to come 
golfing this weekend. What's the deal?" 
<P>
Fourth Guy: "I just set my alarm for 5:30am. When it goes off, 
I shut off my alarm, give the wife a nudge and say, 'Golf Course or 
Intercourse?' and she says, 'Wear your sweater.'" 
<P>
