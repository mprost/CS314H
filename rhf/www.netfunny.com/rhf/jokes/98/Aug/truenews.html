which are funny, but which didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post
such a digest whenever I have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly
selective readers will probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to

From the London Times Newspaper 20th November 1997....

Lost Web site

An elderly couple drove nearly 100 miles from Portsmouth to
BBC Thames Valley Radio in Caversham, Berkshire, to visit
their local Web site. They had seen an advert inviting them
to visit the BBC Web site, and had imagined it was a building.

Subject: Constable picture wins award

The Turner Prize for 1997, and 20,000 UK pounds,
has been won by a video described by one art
critic as 'mesmerising.' Twenty-six uniformed
policemen and women stare, silent and immobile,
into the camera for 60 minutes. Stern, blank faces
gaze unflinchingly into the camera. With tension
mounting, there is suddenly a sound, a slight
movement among the posed ranks. An unseen shuffling
of feet is heard, growing steadily. Suddenly, the
officer at the end screams. According to the
"artist", Miss Gillian Wearing, 34, her film
reflects the role of the pilice in society today.

True story:  There's a new device for TV sets that will filter out

get it to understand the subtleties of the English language.  It kept
converting "The Dick Van Dyke Show" into "jerk Van gay."
