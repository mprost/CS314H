<BR>Tips for a Northerner moving South:<BR>
<P>
1. Save all manner of bacon grease.  You will be instructed later how to<BR>
use it.<BR>
2. If you forget a Southerner's name, refer to him (or her) as  "Bubba."<BR>
You have a 75% chance of being right.<BR>
3. Just because you can drive on snow and ice does not mean we can.<BR>
Stay home the two days of the year it snows.<BR>
4. If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic.  Four men in the<BR>
cab of a four wheel drive with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will<BR>
be along shortly. Don't try to help them. Just stay out of their way.<BR>
This is what they live for.<BR>
5. Don't be surprised to find movie rentals and bait in the same store.<BR>
6. Do not buy food at the movie store.<BR>
7. If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth cooking, let alone<BR>
eating.<BR>
8. Remember:  "Y'all" is singular.  "All y'all" is plural. "All y'all's" is<BR>
plural possessive.<BR>
9. There is nothing sillier than a Northerner imitating a southern<BR>
accent, unless it is a southerner imitating a Boston accent.<BR>
10. Get used to hearing, "You ain't from around here, are you?"<BR>
11. People walk slower here.<BR>
12. Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone.  They don't<BR>
understand you either.<BR>
13. The first Southern expression to creep into a transplanted Northerner's<BR>
vocabulary is the adjective "Big ol'," as in "big ol' truck" or "big<BR>
ol' boy." Eighty-five percent begin their new southern influenced<BR>
dialect with this expression.<BR>
One hundred percent are in denial about it.<BR>
14. The proper pronunciation you learned in school is no longer proper.<BR>
15. Be advised:  The "He needed killin'" defense is valid here.<BR>
16. If attending a funeral in the South, remember, we stay until the last<BR>
shovel of dirt is thrown on and the tent is torn down.<BR>
17. If you hear a Southerner exclaim, "Hey, y'all, watch this!" stay out of<BR>
his way. These are likely the last words he will ever say.<BR>
18. Most Southerners do not use turn signals, and they ignore those who do.<BR>
In  fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a southern license<BR>
plate, you may rest assured that it was on when the car was purchased.<BR>
19. Northerners can be identified by the spit on the inside of their car's<BR>
windshield that comes from yelling at other drivers.<BR>
20. The winter wardrobe you always brought out in September can wait until<BR>
November.<BR>
21. If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the most<BR>
minuscule accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the local<BR>
grocery store.  It does not matter if you need anything from the store,<BR>
it is just something you're supposed to do.<BR>
22. Satellite dishes are very popular in the South.  When you purchase one<BR>
it is to be positioned directly in front of your trailer.  This is<BR>
logical bearing in mind that the dish cost considerably more than the<BR>
trailer and should, therefore, be displayed.<BR>
23. Tornadoes and Southerners going through a divorce have a lot in common.<BR>
In either case, you know someone is going to lose a trailer.<BR>
24. Florida is not considered a southern state.  There are far moreYankees<BR>
than Southerners living there.<BR>
25. In southern churches you will here the hymn, All Glory, Laud and Honor.<BR>
You will also here expressions such as, "Laud, have mercy,""Good Laud",<BR>
and "Laudy, Laudy, Laudy."<BR>
26. As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55 mph  zone, directly<BR>
in the middle of the road, remember, many folks learned to drive on a<BR>
model of vehicle known as John Deere, and this is the proper speed and<BR>
lane position for the vehicle.<BR>
27. You can ask a Southerner for directions, but unless you already know the<BR>
positions of key hills, trees and rocks, you're better off trying to<BR>
find it yourself.<BR>
