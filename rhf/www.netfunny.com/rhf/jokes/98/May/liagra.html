</PRE>With Viagra such a hit, Pfizer is bringing forth a whole 
line of drugs oriented towards improving the performance of 
men in today's society. (This is making the rounds.) 
<P>
DIRECTRA - A dose of this drug given to men before leaving on car 
trips caused 72 percent of them to stop and ask for directions when 
they got lost, compared to a control group where only 0.2 percent 
asked for directions. 
<P>
PROJECTRA - Men given this experimental new drug were far more 
likely to actually finish a household repair project before 
starting a new one. 
<P>
CHILDAGRA - Men taking this drug reported a sudden, overwhelming 
urge to perform more child-care tasks--especially cleaning up 
spills and little accidents. 
<P>
COMPLIMENTRA - In clinical trials, 82 percent of middle-aged men 
administered this drug noticed that their wives had a new 
hairstyle. Currently being tested to see if its effects extend to 
noticing new clothing. 
<P>
BUYAGRA - Married and otherwise attached men reported a sudden 
urge to buy their sweeties expensive jewelry and gifts after 
taking this drug for only two days. Still to be seen: whether the 
drug can be continued for a  period longer than your favorites 
store's return limit. 
<P>
NEGA-VIAGRA - Has the exact opposite effect of Viagra. 
Currently undergoing clinical trials on sitting U.S. presidents. 
<P>
NEGA-SPORTAGRA - This drug had the strange effect of making men 
want to turn off televised sports and actually converse with 
other family members. 
<P>
CAPAGRA - Caused test subjects to become uncharacteristically 
fastidious about lowering toilet seats and replacing toothpaste 
caps. Subjects on higher doses were seen dusting furniture. 
<P>
PRYAGRA - About to fail its clinical trial, this drug gave men in 
the test group an irresistible urge to dig into the personal affairs 
of other people. Note: Apparent over-dose turned three test subjects 
into special prosecutors. 
<P>
LIAGRA - This drug causes men to be less than truthful when they are 
asked about their sexual affairs.  Will be available in Regular, 
Grand Jury and Presidential Strength versions. 
<P>
