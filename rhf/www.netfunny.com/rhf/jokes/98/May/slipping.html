</PRE>John came back from a safari in Africa.  Upon arrival, he went to his friend 
Mark, and told him of his adventures.   "I was out in the jungle," he said, 
"when  all of a sudden I heard a noise in the bush behind me.  Looking back, 
I saw a  huge lion, licking his chops, and smiling at me.  The lion started 
coming my way and I started running, with the lion not far behind.  When 
the lion was almost at my neck, he suddenly slipped, and I got ahead a bit. 
<P>
The lion started gaining on me, and as he got closer, once again he slipped. 
I happened to see a house not far away, and made towards it. 
<P>
As I got close to the house, the lion was almost on top of me, when he 
slipped for a third time.  With the very last bit of strength,  I ran into the 
house and closed the door in the lion's face." 
<P>
"That's some story there, John, I would have messed my pants." 
<P>
"Well,  WHAT DO YOU THINK THE LION KEPT SLIPPING ON...???"
