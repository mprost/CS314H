</PRE>VIRTUAL HILARITY 
<P>
I work in abusy office where a computer going down causes quite an 
inconvenience. Recently one of our computers not only crashed, it made 
a noise that sounded like a heart monitor. "This computer has 
flat-lined," a co-worker called out with mock horror. "Does anyone 
here know how to do mouse-to-mouse?" 
<P>
"Hey, I just heard you can download the entire Tyson-Holyfield fight 
from the Internet," one boxing fan mentioned to another. "Really?" 
said the other man. "How much memory does it take up?" "Very little," 
replied the first man. "Just two bytes." 
<P>
While my brother-in-law was tapping away on his home computer, his 
ten-year-old daughter sneaked up behind him. Then she turned and ran 
into the kitchen, squealing to the rest of the family, "I know Daddy's 
password! I know Daddy's password!" "What is it? her sisters asked 
eagerly. Proudly she replied, "Asterisk, asterisk, asterisk, asterisk, 
asterisk!" 
<P>
A couple of years ago, I helped a friend buy a computer because he 
said I was the only "computer friend" he had. Recently he decided to 
buy a more powerful computer and again asked my advice. "I'm sorry," I 
told him. "I haven't kept up with computers much since your last 
purchase." "Great," he said, "Not only do I have to upgrade my 
computer, I have to upgrade my computer friend too." 
<P>
Little Girl to her friend: "I'm never having kids. I hear they take 
nine months to download." 
<P>
When my printer's type began to grow faint, I called a local repair 
shop where a friendly man informed me that the printer probably needed 
only to be cleaned. Because the store charged $50 for such cleanings, 
he told me, I might be better off reading the printer's manual and 
trying the job myself. Pleasantly surprised by his candor, I asked, 
"Does your boss know that you discourage business?" "Actually it's my 
boss's idea," the employee replied sheepishly. "We usually make more 
money on repairs if we let people try to fix things themselves first." 
<P>
Bumper sticker: Not tonight, dear. I have a modem. 
<P>
When my son Jared began spending lots of time in the Internet chat 
rooms,I worried that his grades would suffer. I made him promise to do 
schoolwork until I returned home at 5p.m. One day at 4:30 I decided to 
check up on him. Using my office computer, I went on-line and entered 
his favorite chat room. To my dismay I saw Jared's name among the list 
of current participants and immediately decided to teach him a lesson 
in front of his cyber friends. "Jared," I typed, "this is your 
mother,and you are grounded for two weeks!" "Hi, Mrs. Beyeler," came a 
reply. "This is David. Jared's doing homework right now, and he said I 
could use his computer. But I'll be sure to let him know that he's 
been grounded."
