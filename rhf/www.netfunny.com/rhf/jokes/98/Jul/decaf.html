<P>
</PRE>This is a purportedly true exchange that even Monty Python would be 
proud of. 
<P>
Here's the background: 
<P>
Ian works in a coffee, bagels, and sandwiches trailer on the campus of 
UNH. (The University of New Hampshire, for those not from the East 
Coast of the U.S.) 
<P>
Vinnie is his boss and the owner of the truck, and yes, according to 
Ian, this actually happened. 
<P>
Ian is telling the story. 
<P>
<BR>Her: Yes, I'd like a milk with some coffee in it.<BR>
Me: So, that's just a splash of coffee in a milk?<BR>
Her: No, a regular amount of milk, but not coffee.<BR>
Me: Is there more milk or coffee?<BR>
Her: Oh, definitely more coffee.<BR>
Me: So that's a coffee with some extra milk.<BR>
Her: Just the usual amount of milk.<BR>
Me: A coffee with milk.<BR>
Her: Yes.<BR>
<P>
Me: Anything else?<BR>
Her: A little extra milk and do you have coffee with no caffeine?<BR>
Me: We do have decaf.<BR>
Her: No, I don't want decaf, just some coffee without the caffeine.<BR>
Me: Ma'am, that's what decaf means, no caffeine.<BR>
Her: Oh, then do you have milk with no caffeine?<BR>
Me: Milk doesn't come with caffeine.<BR>
Her: Yes it does.<BR>
Me: Not that I know of, where do you get your milk?<BR>
Her: It doesn't say caffeine free on the milk so it must have caffeine.<BR>
Me: Oh, you're right, my mistake, I forgot that we only get the decaf milk.<BR>
No problem, we have only decaf milk. Anything else?<BR>
<P>
Her: Do you have any bagels?<BR>
Vinnie (who has been listening all along): I'm sorry, ma'am, we're all out<BR>
of decaf bagels.<BR>
Her: Well, what are those? (pointing at sesame bagels)<BR>
Vinnie: Those are sesame donuts with extra caffeine added.<BR>
Her: I guess I'll just have the coffee.<BR>
<P>
Her: Do you take credit cards?<BR>
Me: No ma'am, cash only.<BR>
Her: What about visa?<BR>
He: Is that a credit card?<BR>
Her: Well, yes.<BR>
Vinnie: Is it cash?<BR>
Her: No.<BR>
Vinnie: Then no, we can't take it.<BR>
Her: What about checks?<BR>
Me: Cash ma'am, nothing else.<BR>
Her: O.K.<BR>
<P>
Her: How much is that?<BR>
Vinnie: Eleven dollars and 45 cents.<BR>
Her: Really?<BR>
Vinnie: New war in Alaska is ruining the coffee business, plus you<BR>
wanted the coffee with no caffeine, that's hard to find now, had to<BR>
grow it myself.<BR>
Her: O.K. (proceeds to write a check)<BR>
<P>
Vinnie: Please leave.<BR>
Her: Why?<BR>
Vinnie: You're raising my blood pressure, leave now.<BR>
Her: But what about my coffee?<BR>
Vinnie: Leave and never return.<BR>
<P>
She leaves, but pays the $11.45 first. Seriously.<BR>
