</PRE>Quote from a recent meeting:  "We are going to continue having these 
meetings everyday until I find out why no work is getting done." 
<P>
Quote from the Boss..."I didn't say it was your fault.  I said I was 
going to blame it on you." 
<P>
A motivational sign at work:  "The beatings will continue until morale 
improves." 
<P>
A direct quote from the Boss:  "We passed over a lot of good people to 
get the ones we hired." 
<P>
My Boss frequently gets lost in thought.  That's because it's 
unfamiliar territory. 
<P>
My Boss said to me, "What you see as a glass ceiling, I see as a 
protective barrier." 
<P>
My Boss needs a surge protector.  That way her mouth would be buffered 
from surprise spikes in her brain. 
<P>
I thought my Boss was a bastard, and quit to work for myself.  My new 
Boss is a bastard too,  but at least I respect him. 
<P>
He's given automobile accident victims new hope for recovery.  He 
walks, talks and performs rudimentary tasks, all without the benefit of 
a SPINE. 
<P>
Some people climb the ladder of success.  My Boss walked under it. 
<P>
Quote from the Boss after overriding the decision of a task force he 
created to find a solution:  "I'm sorry if I ever gave you the 
impression your input would have any effect on my decision for the 
outcome of this project!" 
<P>
HR Manager to job candidate "I see you've had no computer training. 
Although that qualifies you for upper management, it means you're 
under-qualified for our entry level positions." 
<P>
Quote from telephone inquiry "We're only hiring one summer intern this 
year and we won't start interviewing candidates for that position until 
the Boss' daughter finishes her summer classes." 
<P>
