</PRE>A young couple got married and went away on their honeymoon. After 2 weeks 
they came back and finally put away all of the presents they received from 
friends and family. Since this was a new home, the process took some time. 
The silver went into the closet, items were put on the walls for display 
and some of the more intimate apparel was put in the bedroom drawers. 
<P>
A week later, they received in the mail two tickets for a popular show 
where tickets were impossible to get. They were very excited and warmed by 
the gesture of the person who sent this. 
Inside the envelope, however, was only a small piece of paper with a single 
line. 
<P>
"Guess who sent them." 
<P>
The pair had much fun trying to identify the donor, but failed in the 
effort. They went to the theatre, and had a wonderful time. On their return 
home late at night, still trying to guess the identity of the 
unknown host, they found the house stripped of every article of value. And 
on the bare table in the dining-room was a piece of paper on which was 
written in the same hand as the enclosure with the tickets: 
<P>
"Now you know!"
