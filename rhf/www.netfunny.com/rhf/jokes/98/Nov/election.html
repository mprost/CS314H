</PRE>Below find the Governor "The Body" Digest.  This started out as a general 
U.S. election digest, but it seems there was only one aspect of the election 
that people wanted to joke about.  For non-Americans, the state of Minnesota 
just elected former professional wrestler, actor, and Navy SEAL Jesse "The 
Body" Ventura as that state's Governor.  These are jokes which are funny, 
but which didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post such a digest 
whenever I have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly selective 
readers will probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to killfile RHF 
jokes with "Digest" in the title - ed.

<P>
Former professional wrestler Jesse "The Body" Ventura won<BR>
the governor's race in Minnesota.<BR>
<P>
I can see next October's news now:<BR>
<P>
(AP) In the traditional World Series wager, New York Gov. Pataki<BR>
will send a bushel of bagels if the Mets lose. If the Minnesota<BR>
Twins lose, his counterpart Gov. Ventura will personally deliver<BR>
Pataki a king-size can of whup-ass.<BR>

<H1 align=center>Gov. "The Body" Ventura</H1>
<P>
I have a standard response to anyone who rants about Jesse<BR>
"that pro-wrestler guy" Ventura being elected governor of<BR>
Minnesota.  Whenever someone starts screaming about how<BR>
this election means that Americans are stupid and that the<BR>
end of the world is nigh, I flash him/her a look of surprise<BR>
and concern and quietly exclaim:  "um, dude, politics is fake."<BR>

<H1 align=center>Jesse Ventura's campaign promises</H1>
<P>
This came by way of a friend of mine, Chris Bucholtz, and I'm presenting it<BR>
with his permission:<BR>
<P>
&gt; Jesse Ventura's campaign promises:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; 1. Lower unemployment<BR>
&gt; 2. Lessen the tax burden of the average citizen<BR>
&gt; 3. Deliver a lesson in pain to Wisconsin, making that state<BR>
&gt;      wish it had never direspected its common border, delivering<BR>
&gt;      blow after blow is a lesson in cruelty the likes of which<BR>
&gt;      has yet to be seen. You know your time is coming, Wisconsin!<BR>
&gt;      Wisconsin will beg for mercy, McMahon, and Wisconsin's<BR>
&gt;      cries are going to be loud and sad, like the pitiful, pathetic<BR>
&gt;      state it is! Don't think Minnesota has forgotten about the folding<BR>
&gt;      chair that night in Madison--oh no. That's gonna be repaid,<BR>
&gt;      McMahon, repaid a thousandfold in a feverish hurricane of<BR>
&gt;      flying fists and body blows! Michigan and the Dakotas had<BR>
&gt;      better watch themselves, because once Wisconsin goes down,<BR>
&gt;      Minnesota's gonna be looking for them, too! Mark my words,<BR>
&gt;      McMahon--it's gonna be a Minnesota midwestern massacre,<BR>
&gt;      and Wisconsin can start cowering and trying to hide now. But<BR>
&gt;      Minnesota knows where you are, Wisconsin! Minnesota knows<BR>
&gt;      where to find you! You ain't getting away this time. You're too<BR>
&gt;      big to hide, and Minnesota's gonna fight you until there's only<BR>
&gt;      one state standing! Like I always say, McMahon--win if you can,<BR>
&gt;      lose if you must, but always CHEAT!<BR>
&gt; 4. Cut down on crime.<BR>
