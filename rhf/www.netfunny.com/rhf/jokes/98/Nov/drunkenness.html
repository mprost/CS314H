<BR>5 stages of drunkeness<BR>
<P>
Stage 1 - SMART<BR>
<P>
This is when you suddenly become an expert on every subject in the known<BR>
Universe. You know you know everything and want to pass on your<BR>
knowledge to anyone who will listen. At this stage you are always RIGHT.<BR>
And of course the person you are talking to is very WRONG. This makes<BR>
for an interesting argument when both parties are SMART.<BR>
<P>
Stage 2 - GOOD LOOKING<BR>
<P>
This is when you realise that you are the BEST LOOKING person in the<BR>
entire bar and that people want you. You can go up to a perfect stranger<BR>
knowing they want you and really want to talk to you. Bear in mind that<BR>
you are still SMART, so you can talk to this person about any subject<BR>
under the sun.<BR>
<P>
Stage 3 - RICH<BR>
<P>
This is when you suddenly become the richest person in the world. You<BR>
can buy drinks for the entire bar because you have an armoured truck<BR>
full of money parked behind the bar. You can also make bets at this<BR>
stage, because of course, you are still SMART, so naturally you will win<BR>
all your bets. It doesn't matter how much you bet 'cos you are RICH. You<BR>
will also buy drinks for everyone that you fancy, because now you are<BR>
the BEST LOOKING person in the world.<BR>
<P>
Stage 4 - BULLET PROOF<BR>
<P>
You are now ready to pick fights with anyone and everyone especially<BR>
those with whom you have been betting or arguing.  This is because<BR>
nothing can hurt you. At this point you can also go up to the partners<BR>
of the people who you fancy and challenge to a battle of wits or money.<BR>
You have no fear of losing this battle because you are SMART, you are<BR>
RICH and hell, you're BETTER LOOKING than they are anyway!<BR>
<P>
Stage 5 - INVISIBLE<BR>
<P>
This is the Final Stage of Drunkenness. At this point you can do<BR>
anything because NO ONE CAN SEE YOU. You dance on a table to impress the<BR>
people who you  fancy because the rest of the people in the room cannot<BR>
see you. You are also invisible to the person who wants to fight you.<BR>
You can walk through the street singing at the top of your lungs because<BR>
no one can see or hear you and because you're still SMART you know all<BR>
the words.<BR>
