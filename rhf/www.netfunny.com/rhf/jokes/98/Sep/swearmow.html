</PRE>A preacher retired and moved to  the country to  enjoy life and 
practice his hobby of yard work.  Needing a lawn mower, he 
headed into town to buy one. On the way he saw a sign 
advertising a lawn mower for sale. He stopped at the house and 
a young lad came out to greet him. The preacher asked about 
the lawn mower and the kid said it was behind the house. The 
two went to look at the lawn mower. The engine was sputtering 
along at idle speed. The preacher increased the speed of the 
engine and mowed a few strips. Satisfied that the mower would 
do the job they settled on a price of $25.00. 
<P>
Later in the day, the young lad was riding his bicycle when he 
spied the preacher pulling on the engine starter rope. The kid 
stopped and watched for a couple of minutes. He asked, 
"What's wrong?" 
<P>
The reply came, "I can't get this mower started. Do you know 
how?" 
<P>
The kid said, "Yep." 
<P>
"Well,  how do you do it? Tell me!" the preacher yelled. 
<P>
The kid replied, "You have to cuss it." 
<P>
The preacher rose up indignantly. "Now you listen here. I am a 
preacher and if I ever did cuss, not saying I have, I've forgotten 
how to do it after all these years." 
<P>
With a wise look on his face well beyond his years, the kid 
said, "Preacher, you keep on pulling  that rope and it'll all come 
back to ya."
