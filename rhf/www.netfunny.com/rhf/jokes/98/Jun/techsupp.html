</PRE>Why we should feel sorry for tech support people: 
<P>
A woman called the Canon help desk with a problem with her printer.  The 
tech asked her if she was "running it under Windows." The woman then 
responded, "No, my desk is next to the door. But that is a good point.  The 
man sitting in the cubicle next to me is under a window, and his is 
working fine." 
<P>
Tech Support: "OK Bob, let's press the control and escape keys at the same 
time. That brings up a task list in the middle of the screen.  Now type 
the letter 'P' to bring up the Program Manager." 
Customer: "I don't have a 'P'." 
Tech Support: "On your keyboard, Bob." 
Customer: "What do you mean?" 
Tech Support: "'P' on your keyboard, Bob." 
Customer: "I'm not going to do that!" 
<P>
Overheard in a computer shop: 
Customer: "I'd like a mouse mat, please." 
Salesperson: "Certainly sir, we've got a large variety." 
Customer: "But will they be compatible with my computer?" 
<P>
I once received a fax with a note on the bottom to fax the document back to 
the sender when I was finished with it, because he needed to keep it. 
<P>
Customer: "Can you copy the Internet for me on this diskette?" 
<P>
I work for a local ISP. Frequently we receive phone calls that start 
something like this: 
Customer: "Hi. Is this the Internet?" 
<P>
Some people pay for their online services with checks made payable to "The 
Internet." 
<P>
Customer: "So that'll get me connected to the Internet, right?" 
Tech Support: "Yeah." 
Customer: "And that's the latest version of the Internet, right?" 
Tech Support: "Uhh...uh...uh...yeah." 
<P>
Tech Support: "All right...now double-click on the File Manager icon." 
Customer: "That's why I hate this Windows--because of the icons--I'm a 
Protestant, and I don't believe in icons." 
Tech Support: "Well, that's just an industry term sir. I don't 
believe it was meant to --" 
Customer: "I don't care about any 'Industry Terms'. I don't believe in icons." 
Tech Support: "Well...why don't you click on the 'little picture' of a file 
cabinet...is 'little picture' OK?" 
Customer: [click] 
<P>
Customer: "My computer crashed!" 
Tech Support: "It crashed?" 
Customer: "Yeah, it won't let me play my game." 
Tech Support: "All right, hit Control-Alt-Delete to reboot." 
Customer: "No, it didn't crash--it crashed." 
Tech Support: "Huh?" 
Customer: "I crashed my game. That's what I said before. I crashed my 
spaceship and now it doesn't work." 
Tech Support: "Click on 'File,' then 'New Game.'" 
Customer: [pause] "Wow! How'd you learn how to do that?" 
<P>
