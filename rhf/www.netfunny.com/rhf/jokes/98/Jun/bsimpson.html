</PRE>The opening credits of The Simpsons shows Bart Simpson writing the 
same sentence over and over again on a chalkboard, reminiscent of 
the  whole "write it 100 times" punishment, which establishes him as a 
troublemaker. The writers of the Simpsons are famous for changing 
the  opening and closing credits, so that Bart writes a different 
sentence  during the opening credits of each episode.  Someone apparently 
went  through the trouble of taping all the Simpsons, watching them all 
and  writing down what Bart is writing on the board.  These are the 
collected writings of the Simpsons from the chalkboard exercises 
that  Bart writes during the opening credits.  Even you're not a fan, 
you'll  like these.
