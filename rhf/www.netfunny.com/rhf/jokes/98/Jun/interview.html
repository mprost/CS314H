<P>
</PRE>Take the prospective employees you are trying to place and put them in 
a room with only a table and two chairs.  Leave them alone for two 
hours, without any instruction.  At the end of that time, go back and 
see what they are doing. 
<P>
<BR>If they have taken the table apart,<BR>
put them in Engineering.<BR>
<P>
If they are counting the butts in the ashtray,<BR>
assign them to Finance.<BR>
<P>
If they are waving their arms and talking out loud,<BR>
send them to Consulting.<BR>
<P>
If they are talking to the chairs,<BR>
Personnel is a good spot for them.<BR>
<P>
If they are wearing green sunglasses and need a haircut,<BR>
Computer Information Systems is their niche.<BR>
<P>
If the room has a sweaty odor,<BR>
perhaps they're destined for the Help Desk.<BR>
<P>
If they mention what a good price we got for the table and chairs,<BR>
put them into Purchasing.<BR>
<P>
If they mention that hardwood furniture DOES NOT come from rainforests,<BR>
<P>
Public Relations would suit them well.<BR>
<P>
If they are sleeping,<BR>
they are Management material.<BR>
<P>
If they are writing up the experience,<BR>
send them to the Technical Documents team.<BR>
<P>
If they don't even look up when you enter the room,<BR>
assign them to Security.<BR>
<P>
If they try to tell you it's not as bad as it looks,<BR>
send them to Marketing.<BR>
