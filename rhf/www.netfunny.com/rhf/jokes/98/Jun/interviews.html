<BR>HOW TO SCREW UP AN INTERVIEW<BR>
- Submitted by Ken Smith<BR>
---------------------------------<BR>
<P>
</PRE>We've all been interviewed for jobs.  And, we've all spent most of those 
interviews thinking about what not to do.  Don't bite your nails.  Don't 
fidget.  Don't interrupt.  Don't belch.  If we did any of the dont's, we knew 
we'd disqualify ourselves instantly.  But some job applicants go light years 
beyond this.  We surveyed top personnel executives of 100 major American 
corporations and asked for stories of unusual behavior by job applicants. 
The lowlights: 
<P>
1. "... stretched out on the floor to fill out the job application." 
<P>
2. "She wore a Walkman and said she could listen to me and the music 
at the same time." 
<P>
3. " A balding candidate abruptly excused himself. Returned to office 
a few minutes later, wearing a hairpiece." 
<P>
4. "... asked to see interviewer's resume to see if the personnel 
executive was qualified to judge the candidate." 
<P>
5. "... announced she hadn't had lunch and proceeded to eat a hamburger 
and french fries in the interviewer's office - wiping the ketchup 
on her sleeve" 
<P>
6. "Stated that, if he were hired, he would demonstrate his loyalty by 
having the corporate logo tattooed on his forearm." 
<P>
7. "Interrupted to phone his therapist for advice on answering specific 
interview questions." 
<P>
8. "When I asked him about his hobbies, he stood up and started tap 
dancing around my office." 
<P>
9 . "At the end of the interview, while I stood there dumbstruck, went 
through my purse, took out a brush, brushed his hair, and left." 
<P>
10. "... pulled out a Polaroid camera and snapped a flash picture of me. 
Said he collected photos of everyone who interviewed him." 
<P>
11. "Said he wasn't interested because the position paid too much." 
<P>
12. "While I was on a long-distance phone call, the applicant took out 
a copy of Penthouse, and looked through the photos only, stopping 
longest at the centerfold." 
<P>
13. "During the interview, an alarm clock went off from the candidate's 
brief case. He took it out, shut it off, apologized and said he had 
to leave for another interview." 
<P>
14. "A telephone call came in for the job applicant.  It was from his 
wife. His side of the conversation went like this: "Which company? 
When do I start?   What's the salary?" 
I said, "I assume you're not interested in conducting the interview any 
further."  He promptly responded, "I am as long as you'll pay me more. 
<P>
"I didn't hire him, but later found out there was no other job 
offer. It was a scam to get a higher offer." 
<P>
15. "His attache [case] opened when he picked it up and the contents 
spilled, revealing ladies' undergarments and assorted makeup 
and perfume." 
<P>
16. "Candidate said he really didn't want to get a job, but the 
unemployment office needed proof that he was looking for one." 
<P>
17. "... asked who the lovely babe was, pointing to the picture on my 
desk.  When I said it was my wife, he asked if she was home now and 
wanted my phone number.  I called security." 
<P>
18. "Pointing to a black case he carried into my office, he said that 
if he was not hired, the bomb would go off.  Disbelieving, I began 
to state why he would never be hired and that I was going to call 
the police. He then reached down to the case, flipped a switch and 
ran. No one was injured, but I did need to get a new desk." 
<P>
