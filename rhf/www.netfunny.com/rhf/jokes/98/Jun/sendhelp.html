</PRE>Mr. "Jones" is a manager in my company. During a recent discussion 
regarding manager training classes and their effectiveness, the 
following exchange took place: 
<P>
<BR>&gt; Would anybody who reports to Mr. Jones like to agree or disagree<BR>
&gt; that he's a better manager now?<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Mr. Jones has been my manager for quite some time now, and I speak for 
every member of my team when I say that he has become a shining beacon 
of competence because of this management training.  Of course that's not 
to say that he needed improvement, for he has always been possessed of 
an incomparable synergy; but since all those long days when he'd go to 
the beach for management training while the rest of us stayed at work, 
we could not help but note that his shifts have become increasingly 
paradigm, and his values are now undeniably core. 
<P>
I would also like to add that I am unaware of any case in which Mr. 
Jones has brandished any amount of rubber hose, sturdy or otherwise, in 
a threatening manner at his coworkers.  It is not true that his direct 
reports are required to wear underwear with metal eyelets in the back of 
the waistband "for carabiners."  Although it is true that he has on 
occasion settled disagreements with the words, "do we need to ask Mr. 
Hose," that's merely a harmless reference to an inside joke among his 
direct reports rather than the thinly-veiled threat of some dire 
punishment, as is alleged by outsiders who are unfamiliar with Mr. 
Jones' management techniques.  What those people overlook is the 
astonishing speed with which he is able to resolve disagreements within 
his team.  In this light, it seems silly to be concerned over the highly 
emotional and frequently tearful response of his team members to any 
outsider who casually tells them, "you're hosed!"  Furthermore, contrary 
to my detailed and well-documented complaints to my HR representative, I 
wish to make it clear that it is <B>not</B> the case that Mr. Jones has on 
more than one occasion played the Lawnmower Deth song "Illinois Enema 
Bandit" while staring at me and grinning.  I would further like to add 
that Mr. Jones is the best manager I've ever had, and as I write this, 
he is absolutely not standing behind me, slapping a length of sturdy 
rubber hose into his palm like a billy club. 
<P>
Thank you.  Please send help.
