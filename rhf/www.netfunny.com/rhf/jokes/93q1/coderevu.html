In the shower this morning, it occurred to me it would be useful 
to write a guide listing certain words and phrases that arise 
during code reviews and their actual, candid meanings.  Hopefully 
this will help the communication process at technical reviews.

I'm not sure this fits in               If I have anything to do 
with our architecture.                  with it, this code will never 
                                        see the light of day! 
<P>
It's not clear that ...                 There's no way that ... 
<P>
It occurred to me in the                It occurred to me while reading 
shower this morning ...                 netnews today ... 
<P>
I think that's against the              That's not the way I arrange my 
coding standards.                       {whitespace, declarations, ifs, etc.} 
<P>
This logic doesn't belong in            If you do it this way, I'll have to 
this module.                            rework a whole bunch of stuff of mine. 
<P>
Let's take this off line.		If you carry on this pedantic 
                                        discussion another minute, I'll scream. 
<P>
Let's make that an action item.         There's another thing you forgot. 
<P>
Do we really want the user to see       Wouldn't it be funny if the user 
this?                                   saw this? 
<P>
Doing it this way will be hard to       I might have to maintain this  
maintain.                               someday. 
<P>
This really needs to be documented.     We could just leave it undocumented. 
<P>
Let's set up a time to continue the     If you all didn't talk so much, we'd 
review.                                 be done by now.
