Dear Mr. Architect: 
<P>
Please design and build me a house. I am not quite sure of what I need, so 
you should use your discretion. 
<P>
My house should have between two and forty-five bedrooms. Just make sure 
the plans are such that the bedrooms can be easily added or deleted. 
When you bring the blueprints to me, I will make the final decision of 
what I want. Also, bring me the cost breakdown for each configuration so 
that I can arbitrarily pick one. 
<P>
Keep in mind that the house I ultimately choose must cost less than the 
one I am currently living in. Make sure, however, that you correct all 
the deficiencies that exist in my current house (the floor of my kitchen 
vibrates when I walk across it, and the walls don't have nearly enough 
insulation in them). 
<P>
As you design, also keep in mind that I want to keep yearly maintenance 
costs as low as possible. This should mean the incorporation of extra-cost 
features like aluminum, vinyl, or composite siding. (If you choose not 
to specify aluminum, be prepared to explain your decision in detail.) 
<P>
Please take care that modern design practices and the latest materials are 
used in construction of the house, as I want it to be a showplace for the 
most up-to-date ideas and methods. Be alerted, however, that kitchen should 
be designed to accommodate, among other things, my 1952 Gibson refrigerator. 
<P>
To insure that you are building the correct house for our entire family, 
make certain that you contact each of our children, and also our in-laws. My 
mother-in-law will have very strong feelings about how the house should be 
designed, since she visits us at least once a year. Make sure that you weigh 
all of thses options carefully and come to the right decision. I, however, 
retain the right to overrule any choices that you make. 
<P>
Please don't bother me with small details right now. Your job is to 
develop the overall plans for the house: get the big picture. At this time, 
for example, it is not appropriate to be choosing the color of the carpet. 
However, keep in mind that my wife likes blue. 
<P>
Also, do not worry at this time about acquiring the resources to build the 
house itself. Your first priority is to develop detailed plans and 
specifications. Once I approve these plans, however, I would expect the 
house to be under roof within 48 hours. 
<P>
While you are designing this house specifically for me, keep in mind that 
sooner or later I will have to sell it to someone else. It therefore should 
have appeal to a wide variety of potential buyers. Please make sure before 
you finalize the plans that there is a consensus of the population in my 
area that they like the features this house has. 
<P>
I advise you to run up and look at my neighbor's house he constructed last 
year. We like it a great deal. It has many features that we would also like 
in our new home, particularily the 75-foot swimming pool. With careful 
engineering, I believe that you can design this into our new house without 
impacting the final cost. 
<P>
Please prepare a complete set of blueprints. It is not necessary at this 
time to do the real design, since they will be used only for construction 
bids. Be advised, however, that you will be held accountable for any 
increase of construction costs as a result of later design changes. 
<P>
You must be thrilled to be working on as an interesting project as this! 
To be able to use the latest techniques and materials and to be given such 
freedom in your designs is something that can't happen very often. Contact 
me as soon as possible with your complete ideas and plans. 
<P>
PS:  My wife has just told me that she disagrees with many of the 
instructions I've given you in this letter. As architect, it is your 
responsibility to resolve these differences. I have tried in the past 
and have been unable to accomplish this. If you can't handle this 
responsibility, I will have to find another architect. 
<P>
PPS: Perhaps what I need is not a house at all, but a travel trailer. Please 
advise me as soon as possible if this is the case. 
<P>
