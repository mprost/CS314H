<PRE>This is a true story as told to me by my friend.

    Recently, a friend of mine had the opportunity to spend a year abroad in
Hungary as part of a student exchange program.  She had a good time enjoying
the culture, but she especially enjoyed watching reruns of American shows in
Hungarian.  She was not aware, however, of the gap between the American and
Hungarian syndications of the shows.  As an example, she told me of the
following incident.

    She and her host family were watching "Dallas", when she got into an
argument with her host father over some trivial fact about the show.  My
friend finally couldn't take it anymore and said(in Hungarian, of course) "Oh
yeah?  Well I know who shoots J.R.!"  According to her, her host father
suddenly got a look of total shock on his face and slowly said "Someone shoots
J.R.?????"
