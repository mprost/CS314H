<PRE>Heard on Sydney Radio station MMM:

	A woman and her husband are in the supermarket. Her husband is pushing
the trolley, and she's taking all the things they need off the shelf. When she
bends down to pick up some beans, the husband happens to look at her, and he
notices that she hasn't got any underwear on. He says "Look, dear, you haven't
got any underwear on." She replies, "Well, what do you expect? You never give
me any money."

	So he pulls a $100 note out of his wallet and says, "Look, here's $100.
Go and buy yourself some underwear."

	A few days later, his wife is talking to a friend, and she mentions that
she was able to get $100 from her husband. Her friend decides that she might be
able to do the same thing to her husband, so the next time she goes shopping,
she takes her husband, and she doesn't wear any underwear.

	The husband is pushing the trolley, and she is taking all the things
they need off the shelf. She bends over to get a can of beans, and her husband
notices that she isn't wearing any underwear. So he says, "Hey, you aren't wearing any underwear." She replies, "Well, what do you expect? You never give me
any money."

	At this the husband pulls a comb out of his pocket and says

	"Well, at least make yourself look respectable then."
