As I'm sure you all remember, some buffoon recently cross-posted a bit 
of anti-Japanese ranting titled "DidYouKnow" to every single group on 
the whole freakin' net. I first stumbled across it in 
rec.arts.int-fiction, the newsgroup dedicated to interactive fiction. So 
I penned the following response: 
<P>
<BR>&gt;ASK BUZY ABOUT CROSS-POSTING<BR>
Buzzy looks up at the Newsgroups, and sees that you have trimmed all but<BR>
rec.games.int-fiction. "Aw, he says, what'd you do that for? I really<BR>
thought it was important that rec.bicycles.misc know about this."<BR>
<P>
&gt;ASK BUZY ABOUT REC.GAMES.INT-FICTION<BR>
"Well, I figured that, pretty soon, those darn Oriental types would own<BR>
Activision, and then-- well, what would happen to good old fashioned<BR>
American craftsmanship?"<BR>
<P>
&gt;SHOW LTOI TO BUZY<BR>
Buzy examines it. He shrugs. "So?"<BR>
<P>
&gt;OPEN BOX. SHOW MANUAL TO BUZY.<BR>
Buzy begins to read. "Good God! This is a disaster! Such shoddy<BR>
workmanship!"<BR>
<P>
&gt;I<BR>
You have: The New York Times, an American flag, a book of essays by<BR>
Kant, a bottle of some sort of blue liquid, and a box containing The<BR>
Lost Treasures of Infocom.<BR>
<P>
&gt;READ TIMES<BR>
The front page headline says, "IBM sustains record losses." Everything<BR>
else is about sports.<BR>
<P>
&gt;SHOW HEADLINE TO BUZY<BR>
Buzy gapes in disbelief. "IBM? Clearly they're failing because of unfair<BR>
competition."<BR>
<P>
&gt;TELL BUZY ABOUT BIG BLUE<BR>
You outline in a few brief words how IBM allowed itself to become<BR>
unweildy and uncompetitive. Buzy is not impressed. "Yeah, yeah, it's the<BR>
fault of those durn Japs."<BR>
<P>
&gt;READ KANT TO BUZY<BR>
You read Buzy a passage in which the philosphers outlines his concept of<BR>
individual responsibility, in which all men are responsible for their<BR>
own actions. Buzy is not impressed. "Yeah, yeah- Kant was a furriner,<BR>
wasn't he?"<BR>
<P>
&gt;OPEN JAR<BR>
Opening the jar reveals a brain, suspended in the blue liquid.<BR>
<P>
&gt;GIVE BRAIN TO BUZY<BR>
Buzy looks at the brain, unsure of what to do with it.<BR>
<P>
&gt;OPEN BUZY'S HEAD.<BR>
WIth a few twists, you open his head. It must not have been sealed very<BR>
tightly.<BR>
<P>
&gt;PUT BRAIN IN BUZY'S HEAD<BR>
You place the brain in Buzy's head. Suddenly, his eyes light up. "Good<BR>
gosh!" he exclaims. "We <I>are</I> all responsible for our own actions,<BR>
whether we are a CEO taking home millions of dollars a year while our<BR>
company grows bloated and inefficient, or an obnoxious Usenet user<BR>
cross-posting conspiracy theories to a thousand irrelevant newsgroups!<BR>
Now that I understand that, I'm going to devote my life to ridding my<BR>
countrymen of the xenophobia that prevents them from dealing squarely<BR>
with the real causes of our problems. But... But I'm thinking<BR>
independantly. Isn't that un-American?"<BR>
<P>
&gt;GIVE FLAG TO BUZY<BR>
Buzy waves the flag in the air, and seems to feel much better. He dashes<BR>
off, singing "God Bless America."<BR>
<P>
**Your GNP has just gone up.**<BR>
