<PRE>Fifty ways to hose your source code

  (with apologies to Paul Simon)

The problem's all inside your head, she said to me.
Recursion's easy if you take it logically.
I'm here to help you, if you're struggling to learn C.
There must be fifty ways to hose your source code.

She said it's really not my habit to #include.
I hope my code files won't be lost or misconstrued.
I'll recompile them at the risk of getting screwed.
There must be fifty ways to hose your source code.

Just blow up the stack, Jack.
Make a bad call, Paul.
Just hit the wrong key, Lee.
And set your pointers free.

Just mess up the bus, Gus.
You don't need to recurse much.
You just listen to me.

She said it grieves me so to see you recompile, again.
I wish we had hardware that wasn't such a pain.
I said I appreciate that, and could you please explain.
About the fifty ways.

She told me why don't we both work on it tonight.
When morning comes, I'm sure that it will work just right.
There must be fifty ways to hose your source code.

Just lose the address, Les.
Clear the wrong int, Clint.
Traverse the wrong tree, Lee.
And set your list free.

Just mess up the bus, Gus.
You don't need to recurse much.
You just program in C.
