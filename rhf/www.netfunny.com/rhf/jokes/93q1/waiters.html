You know them... those waiters/waitresses who turn obsequiousness into 
a weapon, whose solicitous inquiries are perfectly timed to destroy 
your jokes and intimate moments... something like this: 
<P>
<B>YOU:</B>	... so, finally, the <B>third</B> farmer turns to the bartender and 
says, "Hey, that's not a duck, that's---" 
<P>
[Waiter appears out of nowhere] 
<P>
<B>WAITER:</B> How is everything?  [beams smugly] 
<P>
<B>YOU:</B>	Fine.  So he says, "Hey, that's not a duck, that's a---" 
<P>
<B>WAITER:</B> Can I get you anything else to drink?  [All the glasses are full] 
<P>
<B>YOU:</B>	No, no.  Anyway, "That's not a duck, that's a---" 
<P>
<B>WAITER:</B> [to your companion] And for you, madam? 
<P>
<B>HER:</B>	Hmm?  Oh, let me see... 
<P>
[You give up; the waiter returns to the kitchen triumphantly] 
<P>
Later... 
<P>
<B>YOU:</B>	... and the doctor looked at the X-ray yesterday and told me 
that if I <B>didn't</B> have the operation, eventually it would 
get so big that they'd have to cut off my--- 
<P>
[Waiter materializes from thin air, bends over the table to refill 
the water glasses, coming in between you and her.] 
<P>
<B>WAITER:</B> Go ahead, don't let me interrupt you. 
<P>
[You pointedly ignore the waiter, drumming your fingers on the table top.] 
<P>
<B>HER:</B>	Well, go on, what was it they would have to cut off? 
<P>
[You stare helplessly at her while the waiter refills the salt and 
pepper shakers at your table.] 
<P>
<B>HER:</B>	Come on, aren't you going to tell me? 
<P>
[The waiter finishes with the condiments and moves away.] 
<P>
<B>YOU:</B>	[recovering your composure and remembering the gravity of the moment] 
Well, it's no big deal, they just <B>may</B> have to remove my--- 
<P>
<B>WAITER:</B>	[turning back in a lightning maneuver] Excuse me, I nearly forgot 
the tabasco sauce, here you are. 
<P>
Another victory.  Later... 
<P>
<B>YOU:</B>	[looking around to make sure the waiter is nowhere in sight]  ... and 
I just wanted to tell you, every time I'm with you I feel like 
the world is new, and my heart fills up with--- 
<P>
[A dessert tray appears by the table, the waiter sprinting to get it there 
in time.] 
<P>
<B>WAITER:</B>	Some dessert?  We have plain cheesecake, chocolate cheesecake, 
chocolate chip cheesecake, chocolate fudge cheesecake, dutch 
chocolate cheesecake--- 
<P>
<B>YOU:</B>	NOT NOW!  [Attempt to get back into romantic mood, ignoring waiter] 
My heart just fills up with--- 
<P>
<B>WAITER:</B>	Okay, I'll come back later.  Can I bring you some coffee while 
you're making up your mind? 
<P>
<B>YOU:</B>	[trying to drown him out]  MY HEART JUST FILLS UP WITH--- 
<P>
<B>HER:</B>	Did you say bittersweet chocolate cheesecake? 
<P>
<B>WAITER:</B>	I'll see if we have any left. 
<P>
[Game, set, and match] 
<P>
