<PRE>Here are some amusing quotes from one of my favorite games, OMEGA.  
OMEGA is a ROGUE-style adventure game written by Laurence Brothers 
(and ported to MSDOS by Nathan Glasser), whose scope extends far 
beyond NETHACK, RAGNAROK, MORIA, or any of the other ROGUE-style games 
presently in existence.

Not only is OMEGA an involved game, but it is also quite amusing.  I 
obtained the source code a while ago (which is available to all by 
anonymous ftp), and went through the string space to pick out all of 
my favorite lines.  Here they are.  (Permission to reproduce the 
following quotes granted by the author, Laurence Brothers.)
