From my Friend Mark: 
<P>
The following is an actual letter that I sent to Nestle regarding a box of 
Carnation Instant Breakfast that I had.  They responded by sending me a coupon 
for a free box.

Dear Sirs: 
<P>
I am writing in regards to a box of Carnation Instant Breakfast that I 
recently purchased.  I have been a regular drinker of CIB for a very long time, 
but I have never seen a batch quite like this.  It seems to be milk-proof.  It 
will not dissolve in milk.  I tried two of the packages from the box of 10 and 
both reacted the same way:  they turned into rocky lumps.  While it is true thatit might have proven to be quite filling, I don't think that's what they mean 
when they say, "It sticks to your ribs." 
<P>
I have enclosed two of the remaining packets from this box for you to 
experiment with and marvel at.  The production code from the box top is 1WA206W,and the UPC code from the bottom of the box is 50000 53032. 
<P>
The boxes of Carnation Instant Breakfast that I have purchased since this 
one were normal.  I wanted to bring this matter to your attention because, 
although this batch of Carnation Instant Breakfast is unsuitable as a beverage, 
perhaps there is some potential for marketing it as a bathroom tile grout mix. 
<P>
Sincerely, 
<P>
Mark Stellmack
