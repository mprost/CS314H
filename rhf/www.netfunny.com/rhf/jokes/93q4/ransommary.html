<PRE>This is my favorite Christmas joke.

A little boy is told by his mother that he has been very bad this year.

"What? Nothing for Christmas?" cried the little boy.
"Well," said Mom, "maybe if you write a letter to baby Jesus and tell him
how sorry you are, Santa will bring you some presents."

The little boy returned to his room and began his letter. With each
attempt at writing he would first apologize and then promise to be good
for a certain amount of time. Each letter he crumpled up started again,
making the "be good" time shorter with each letter. Finally in frustration
he gave up and then was struck by a bolt of inspiration! Running to the
living room he carefully removed the little Mother Mary figure from the
family's manger scene and carefully wrapped it in a sock, placing it in
his top drawer. Returning to his desk, he took out a piece of paper and
began to write:

"Dear Baby Jesus, if you ever want to see your Mother again..."
