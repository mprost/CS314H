This was sent to me by Stefan (who works here), who got it from Steve (who 
works at Hayes down the street), who evidently got it from somewhere that 
had SPY magazine in its ancestry....The rebuttal is all mine, however. Jim. 
<P>
Proposition: IS THERE A SANTA CLAUS? (See below for my rebuttal..) 
<P>
As a result of an overwhelming lack of requests, and with research help from 
that renown scientific journal SPY magazine (January, 1990) - I am pleased to 
present the annual scientific inquiry into Santa Claus. 
<P>
1)  No known species of reindeer can fly.  BUT there are 300,000 species of 
living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects 
and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only Santa 
has ever seen. 
<P>
2)  There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world. 
BUT since Santa doesn't (appear) to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and 
Buddhist children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378 
million according to Population Reference Bureau.  At an average (census) 
rate of 3.5 children per household, that's 91.8 million homes.  One presumes 
there's at least one good child in each. 
<P>
3)  Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different 
time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west 
(which seems logical).  This works out to 822.6 visits per second. 
<P>
This is to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa 
has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the 
chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the 
tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back 
into the sleigh and move on to the next house.  Assuming that each of these 
91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, 
we know to be false but for the purposes of our calculations we will accept), 
we are now talking about .78 miles per household, a total trip of 75-1/2 
million miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least once 
every 31 hours, plus feeding and etc. 
<P>
This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3,000 
times the speed of sound.  For purposes of comparison, the fastest man- made 
vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per 
second - a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour. 
<P>
4)  The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element.  Assuming 
that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized lego set (2 pounds), 
the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably 
described as overweight.  On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more 
than 300 pounds.  Even granting that "flying reindeer" (see point #1) could 
pull TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even 
nine.  We need 214,200 reindeer.  This increases the payload - not even 
counting the weight of the sleigh - to 353,430 tons. 
Again, for comparison - this is four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth. 
<P>
5)  353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air 
resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as 
spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere.  The lead pair of reindeer 
will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy.  Per second.  Each.  In short, 
they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer 
behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake. 
The entire reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a 
second.  Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces 17,500.06 
times greater than gravity.  A 250-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) 
would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force. 
<P>
In conclusion - If Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he's 
dead now. 
<P>
REBUTTAL: (Jim Mantle, Waterloo Maple Software) 
<P>
Come on, ya gotta believe! I mean, if you can handle flying furry animals, then 
it's only a small step to the rest. 
<P>
For example; 
<P>
1) As admitted, it is possible that a flying reindeer can be found. I would 
agree that it would be quite an unusual find, but they might exist. 
<P>
2) You've relied on cascading assumptions. For example, you have assumed a 
uniform distribution of children across homes. Toronto/Yorkville, or 
Toronto/Cabbagetown, or other yuppie neighbourhoods, have probably less than 
the average (and don't forget the DINK and SINK homes (Double Income No Kids, 
Single Income No Kids)), while the families with 748 starving children that 
they keep showing on Vision TV while trying to pick my pocket would skew that 
15% of homes down a few percent. 
<P>
3) You've also assumed that each home that has kids would have at least one 
good kid. What if anti-selection applies, and homes with good kids tend to have 
more than their share of good kids, and other homes have nothing except 
terrorists in diapers? Let's drop that number of homes down a few more percent. 
<P>
4) Santa would have to Fedex a number of packages ahead of time, since he would 
not be able to fly into Air Force Bases, or into tower-controlled areas near 
airports. He's get shot at over certain sections of the Middle East, and the 
no-fly zones in Iraq, so he'd probably use DHL there. Subtract some more homes. 
<P>
5) I just barely passed Physics and only read Stephen Hawking's book once, but 
I recall that there is some Einsteinian Theory that says time does strange 
things as you move faster. In fact, when you go faster than the speed of light 
time runs backward, if you do a straight line projection, connect the dots and 
just ignore any singularity you might find right at the speed of light. And 
don't say you can't go faster than the speed of light because I've seen it done 
on TV. Jean-Luc doesn't have reindeer but he does have matter-antimatter warp 
engines and a holodeck and that's good enough for me. 
<P>
So Santa could go faster than light, visit all the good children which are not 
uniformly distributed by either concentration in each home or by number of 
children per household, and get home before he left so he can digest all those 
stale cookies and warm milk yech. 
<P>
6) Aha, you say, Jean-Luc has matter-antimatter warp engines, Santa only has 
reindeer, where does he get the power to move that fast! 
<P>
You calculated the answer! The lead pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3 
QUINTILLION joules of energy.  Per second.  Each. This is an ample supply of 
energy for the maneuvering, acceleration, etc, that would be required of the 
loaded sleigh. The reindeer don't evaporate or incinerate because of this 
energy, they accelerate. What do you think they have antlers for, fighting over 
females? Think of antlers as furry solar array panels. 
<P>
7. If that's not enough, watch the news on the 24th at 11 o'clock. NORAD (which 
may be one of the few government agencies with more than 3 initials in it's 
name and therefore it must be more trustworthy than the rest) tracks Santa 
every year and I've seen the radar shots of him approaching my house from the 
direction of the North Pole. They haven't bomarck'd him yet, so they must 
believe too, right? 
<P>
