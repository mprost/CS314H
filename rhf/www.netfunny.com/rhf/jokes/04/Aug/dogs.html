</PRE>Humor is universal and the same joke appears in many cultures.  Sometimes 
the stories vary tremendously but the point is the same. Here then are the 
story of two pious dogs. 
<P>
The Jewish Version: 
<P>
A guy gets a new dog, a nice Jewish dog. So he calls him Irving. 
He can't wait to show him off to his neighbor, so when the neighbor 
finally comes over, the guy calls Irving into the house, bragging about how 
smart he is. 
The dog quickly comes running and stands looking up at his master, tail 
wagging excitedly, mouth open, tongue hanging out, eyes bright with 
anticipation. 
The guy points to the newspaper by the door and commands "Okay, Irving, 
Fetch!" 
Immediately, the dog climbs on to the couch and sits, his tail wagging 
furiously. 
Then all of a sudden, he stops. His doggie smile disappears. He starts 
to frown and puts on a sour face. 
Looking up at his master, he whines, "You think this is easy, wagging my 
tail all the time? Oy ... This constant wagging of the tail puts me in such 
pain, you should only know! And you think it's easy eating that dreck you 
call designer dog food. Forget it ... it's too salty and it gives me gas. 
And also the runs, but what do you care? Why don't you try it if you think 
it's so good? You try it. Dreck I say! Then you push me out the door to take 
care of my business, twice a day. It's disgusting I tell you! And when was 
the last time you took me for a nice long walk? I can't remember when!" 
The neighbor is absolutely amazed ... stunned. In astonishment, he says, 
"I can't believe it. Irving can speak. Your dog actually talks. Here he is 
sitting on the sofa talking to us." 
"I know, I know." says the owner. "He's not yet fully trained yet. He 
thought I said, 'Kvetch'." 
<P>
The Christian Version: 
<P>
A strong Baptist family decided to buy a home and make everything in the 
house Baptist.  They were going to make it look and feel Baptist through and 
through.  So when they were finished they went to a petshop to look for a 
Baptist dog. 
They asked the owner, "Do you have a Baptist dog?" 
Surprised, the petshop owner thought about it for a while and then 
nodded, saying, "Yes... yes, I think we have a dog that will fit your 
description." 
So the owner brought out the dog to the family, and the father said, 
"Let's see if this is a real Baptist dog." So the father said to the dog, 
"Go get a Bible." 
And the dog ran over to a table, grabbed a Bible in its mouth, ran back 
to the man and plopped the book at his feet. 
Impressed, the father continued, "Let's see if this dog knows its books 
of the Bible...  Turn to Psalm 23." 
The dog then opened the Bible with its snout and pawed through the pages 
to Psalm 23. 
Very pleased, the father bought the dog and brought it home. 
The next day, the family had visitors. They showed their friends the 
Baptist dog and the things it could do. 
Finally, the friends asked, "Well, can it do any other tricks that 
normal dogs do?" 
The Baptist father wondered and said, "Hmm, I don't know. I've never 
tried." He then ordered the dog, "Heel." 
Suddenly the dog leaped onto the father's lap and placed its paw on the 
man's head and started to pray. 
"Wait a minute!" exclaimed the Baptist mother, "This dog isn't Baptist! 
It's Pentecostal!"
