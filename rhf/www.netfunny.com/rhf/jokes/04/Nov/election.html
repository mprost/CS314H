</PRE>What follows are the better of the quickies that I've received regarding the 
U.S. Election.  These are jokes which are funny, but which didn't really 
warrant posting separately.  I post such a digest whenever I have enough 
entries to warrant it.  Particularly selective readers will probably not 
enjoy the digests, and may want to killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in the 
title - ed.

&gt;Subject: need a place to stay ?<BR>
<P>
</PRE>As a Canadian about to visit NY state for a dance weekend, I posted to 
a New England mailing list the following comment: 
<P>
<BR>&gt; See y'all November 19 at the DNE weekend!<BR>
&gt; (Got a place for a few Canadians to stay overnight?)<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Early on Wednesday, November 3, as the US election results were becoming 
known, back came the following plaintive reply: 
<P>
<BR>&gt;&gt;Re: (Got a place for a few Canadians to stay overnight?)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; got a place for 50 million Americans for four years?<BR>

&gt;Subject: Washoe in the White House<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Has anyone else noticed the irony?  The 51% of the U.S. population who 
voted for a chimpanzee includes the whole of the U.S. population who don't 
believe in evolution. 
<P>

&gt;Subject: Bush Charges Ahead (orginal)<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Following President Bush'es reelection and his press conference to 
announce his aganda for his second term, the Orange County Register ran 
a headline declaring "Bush Charges Ahead." 
<P>
On seeing it, my initial reaction was "Now that's a fast prosecutor!"

<H1 align=center>Democrats: Don't Despair</H1>
<P>
</PRE>&gt;From a post-election newsletter from Michael Moore. Subject: 17 Reasons Not 
to Slit Your Wrists: 
<P>
9. Gays, thanks to the ballot measures passed on Tuesday, cannot get 
married in 11 new states. Thank God. Just think of all those wedding gifts 
we won't have to buy now.

&gt;Subject: The Real Difference<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Heard from my brother-- 
<P>
In this election, the candidates had two radically different opinions. 
Unfortunately, they both belonged to John Kerry. 
<P>

&gt;Subject: Bin Laden Video Tape<BR>
<P>
</PRE>In a videotape released at the end of October 2004, Osama bin Laden 
said that he's going to bankrupt the United States.  So at least 
there's <B>something</B> he and George W. Bush have in common.

&gt;From: gherbert@retro.com (George William Herbert)<BR>
&gt;Subject: Kindler, Gentler Second Term [original]<BR>
<P>
</PRE>It's true that George Bush is a tolerant man and that he is 
planning on being more socially liberal in his second term. 
He has acknowledged the rights of homosexuals and believes 
they have an important place in our society. 
<P>
He is going to start by asking Congress to pay for 
adding more closets to all public buildings under 
the Americans with Disabilities act. 
<P>

even when one is not there.

&gt;Subject: The secret of the Republicans' success<BR>
<P>
</PRE>(Heard on WNYC's The No Show hosted by Steve Post, 11/7) 
<P>
</PRE>The reason that the Republicans were able to prevail in Tuesday's election is 
that they forged a coalition of the Very Frightened and the Very Frightening.
