</PRE>Customer: My Outlook Inbox has a bunch of emails that are bold black, and a 
bunch that are plain black. Why is that the case? 
<P>
Tech Support: Uh... that's because they haven't been read? 
<P>
Customer: Well, duh. Of course not. They're bold black. How do I make them 
not bold? 
<P>
Tech Support: [puzzled by the "Duh" response] Uh... read them. 
<P>
Customer: But, there are hundreds, and they're mostly junk. 
<P>
Tech Support: Then delete them. 
<P>
Customer: I can't. Our IT wants us to keep them for six months so they can 
analyze patterns and see if their filtering is working. 
<P>
Tech Support: Then move them to a different folder. 
<P>
Customer: Okay. But, they're still bold black. And now the folder in the 
folder list is bold, too. This makes me think there's new email in there. Is 
there a way I can make them less annoyingly conspicuous? 
<P>
Tech Support: Mark them as Read. 
<P>
Customer: Uh... okay. 
<P>
[30 minutes later] 
<P>
Tech Support: Did you mark them as Read? 
<P>
Customer: Yeah. It wasn't easy, because I had to find out how change the 
color settings. And it didn't solve the problem. They're still bold, and the 
folder still indicates that there is new mail in that folder. 
<P>
Tech Support: Why did you have to change the settings? 
<P>
Customer: So I could mark all those messages red. 
<P>
Tech Support: [muffled laughter of sudden realization] 
<P>
Customer: What did you call me?
