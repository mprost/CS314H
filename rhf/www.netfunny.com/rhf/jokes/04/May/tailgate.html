</PRE>An honest man is being tailgated by a stressed-out woman on a busy 
boulevard. Suddenly, the light turns yellow, just in front of him. He does 
the honest thing, and stops at the crosswalk, even though he could have 
beaten the red light by accelerating through the intersection. 
<P>
The tailgating woman hits the roof, and the horn, screaming in frustration 
as she misses her chance to get through the intersection with him. 
<P>
As she is still in mid-rant, she hears a tap on her window and looks up 
into the face of a very serious police officer. The officer orders her to 
exit her car with her hands up. He takes her to the police station where 
she is searched, fingerprinted, photographed, and placed in a cell. 
<P>
After a couple of hours, a policeman approaches the cell and opens the 
door. She is escorted back to the booking desk where the arresting officer 
is waiting with her personal effects. He says, "I'm very sorry for this 
mistake.  You see, I pulled up behind your car while you were blowing 
your horn, flipping the guy off in front of you, and cussing a blue streak 
at him.  I noticed the 'Choose Life' license plate holder, the 'What Would 
Jesus Do' bumper sticker, the 'Follow Me to Sunday School' bumper sticker, 
and the chrome plated Christian fish emblem on the trunk.  Naturally, I 
assumed you had stolen the car." 
<P>
