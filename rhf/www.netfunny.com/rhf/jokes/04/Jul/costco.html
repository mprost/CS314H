</PRE>[Note - Costco is one of those big warehouse stores - ed] 
<P>
We've got the Atkins diet, the South Beach diet and the Jenny Craig diet. 
I'd like to introduce an even cheaper and more effective diet, the 
COSTCO diet!  It's cost effective and easy to do even on your busiest 
shopping day.  Here's how it works. 
<P>
Start by making a grocery list of 10 or more items and then head to your 
local COSTCO or similar warehouse store.  When you get there, carefully 
tear your list into strips and put all the strips in your pocket.  Grab a 
shopping cart and you're ready to go! 
<P>
Pull out the first strip and make your way all the way across the store 
to that item.  As you trek through the store, you will see vendors giving 
out free food samples.  As you pass the third one, take a sample of what 
ever they are selling.  Repeat with each strip of paper until you have 
finished your shopping.  By the time you are finished, you will have 
eaten 5 to 10 samples and will have walked at least 5 miles. 
<P>
There are several important points to remember; 
<P>
1) There is a law of nature that says, "Whatever you look for in COSTCO 
will be on the opposite side of the warehouse."  This ensures that 
you will walk far enough to satisfy the American Heart Association's 
exercise requirement. 
<P>
2) Do not skip the melba-toast with cream cheese sample in order to get 
the Ben and Jerry's ice cream sample.  It's the randomness of the food 
selection that guarantees a balanced diet. 
<P>
3) Do not double dip.  Getting two samples from the same vendor at the 
same time is NOT acceptable.  We know you won't get two samples of fried 
squid to make up for it, so don't kid yourself when you grab that second 
cup of ice cream. 
<P>
If you don't have paper to write your shopping list on, you can get 
a similarly random list by calling your spouse.   "Hi! I'm at Costco, 
want anything?" will almost always result in half a dozen things that 
you just have to buy.  Don't forget to pick up a 10 pack of writing 
tablets on aisle 10. 
<P>
