</PRE>A mere two days before Valentine's Day, Mattel has announced that Barbie 
is ditching Ken cold after their 42 year relationship. "Like other 
celebrity couples, their Hollywood romance has come to an end," said 
Russell Arons, vice president of marketing at Mattel. Arons said that 
Barbie and Ken "feel it's time to spend some quality time--apart." 
<P>
"It's splitsville for Barbie and Ken," today's CNN webpage trumpeted, the 
story eclipsing such less-important headlines as "British flights grounded 
amid terrorism fears" and "Pakistan to share nuclear evidence." 
<P>
The announcement, made even as conservative lawmakers fight to uphold a 
traditional view of the institution of marriage, was followed up by more 
lurid rumors of a possible new relationship between Barbie and the doll 
Blaine, described by CNN as "Blaine the Australian boogie boarder." The 
outsourcing of yet another American position, and the implication that 
Barbie was no longer satisfied with American males, may add to the 
political repercussions of today's news. 
<P>
Barbie will be keeping the Malibu Dream Home, the Living In Style Kitchen, 
the Barbie Volkswagen Microbus, the Barbie Ford Thunderbird and the Barbie 
Cruise Ship. Ken will be unemployed. "He will head for other waves," Arons 
said cryptically. 
<P>
When asked for release dates of "Bitter Jilted Ken" and "Jack Daniel's 
Ken," Mattel declined comment.
