</PRE>I have two children, one of each. My son enjoys playing with Lego 
Bionicles, and his sister sometimes likes to play with them too.  These are 
robot/monster type toys that can be assembled and rebuilt to some degree. 
<P>
One morning our son comes in our room and shows us that he has taken parts 
from two of the Bionicles and created a new one that has two dangerous 
weapons, poison and ice.  He describes all the ways his new toy can 
fight enemies. 
<P>
Then our daughter comes in with Gali Nuva, the blue Bionicle.  She likes 
this one because it's her favorite color.  She says Gali Nuva is going 
to put on a show and do gymnastics and singing and dancing, so everyone 
will sit and watch and enjoy the show. 
<P>
I am thinking to myself that there is a huge difference between how girls 
and boys play with the same toy. 
<P>
Then my daughter continues, "So when they're all watching really carefully, 
Gali Nuva can kill them."
