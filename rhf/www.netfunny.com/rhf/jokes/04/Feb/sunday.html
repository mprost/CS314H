</PRE>While they were taking up the collection, John leaned forward and said, 
"Hey, Marie, how about you and me go to dinner next Friday?" 
<P>
"Why Yes, John, that would be nice," said Marie. 
<P>
Well, John couldn't believe his luck. All week long he polished up his 
car, and on Friday he picked up Marie and took her to dinner, the finest 
restaurant in Raleigh. When they sat down, John looked over at Marie 
said, "Hey, Marie, would you like a cocktail before dinner?" 
<P>
"Oh, no, John, "said Marie. "What would I tell my Sunday School class?" 
<P>
Well, John was setback a bit, so he didn't say much until after dinner. 
Then he reached in his pocket and pulled out a pack of cigarettes. "Hey, 
Marie," said John, "Would you like a smoke?" 
<P>
"Oh, no, John," said Marie. "What would I tell my Sunday School class?" 
<P>
Well, John was feeling pretty low after that, so he just got in his car 
and was driving Marie home when they passed the Holiday Inn. He'd struck 
out twice already, so he figured he had nothing to lose. 
<P>
"Hey, Marie," said John, "how would you like to stop at this motel with me?" 
<P>
"Sure, John, that would be nice," said Marie. 
<P>
Well, John couldn't believe his luck. He did a U-turn right then and 
there across the median and everything, and drove back to the motel and 
checked in with Marie. 
<P>
The next morning John got up first. He looked at Marie lying there in 
the bed. 
<P>
"What have I done? What have I done?" thought John. 
<P>
He shook Marie and she woke up. "Marie, I've got to ask you one thing, 
said John. "What are you going to tell your Sunday School class?" 
<P>
Marie said, "The same thing I always tell them......... You don't have 
to smoke and drink to have a good time
