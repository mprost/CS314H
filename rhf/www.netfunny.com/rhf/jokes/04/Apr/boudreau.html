</PRE>This happened about a month ago just outside a little town in the 
bayou country  of Louisiana, and while it sounds like an Alfred 
Hitchcock tale, it's real. 
<P>
This guy was on the side of the road hitchhiking on a real dark night 
in the middle of a thunder storm. Time passed slowly and no cars went 
by. It was raining so hard he could hardly see his hand in front of his 
face.  Suddenly he saw a car moving slowly approaching  and appearing 
ghostlike in the rain.  It slowly crept toward him and stopped. 
<P>
Wanting a ride real bad the guy jumped in the car and closed the door, 
only then did he realize that there was nobody behind the wheel. 
The car slowly started moving and the guy was terrified, too scared to 
think of jumping out and running. The guy saw that the car was slowly 
approaching a sharp curve, still too scared to jump out, he started to 
pray and beg for his life; he was sure the ghost car would go off 
the road and into the bayou and he would surely drown, when just before 
the curve, a hand appeared thru the driver's window and turned the 
steering wheel, guiding the car safely around the bend. 
<P>
Paralyzed with fear, the guy watched the hand reappear every time they 
reached a curve. Finally the guy, scared to near death, had all he could 
take and jumped out of the car and ran to town. 
<P>
Wet and in shock, he went into a bar and voice quavering, ordered two 
shots of whiskey, then told everybody about his supernatural 
experience. A silence enveloped and everybody got goose bumps when they 
realized the guy was telling the truth and not just some drunk. 
<P>
About half an hour later two guys walked into the bar and one says to 
the other, "Look Boudreaux, ders dat idiot that rode in our car when we 
was pushin it in the rain." 
<P>
