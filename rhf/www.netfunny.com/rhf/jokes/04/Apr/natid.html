<P>
</PRE>Operator: "Thank you for calling Pizza Hut. May I have your national ID 
number?" 
<P>
Customer: "Hi, I'd like to place an order." 
<P>
Operator: "May I have your NIDN first, sir?" 
<P>
Customer: "My National ID Number, yeah, hold on, eh, it's 
6102049998-45-54610." 
<P>
Operator: "Thank you, Mr. Sheehan.  I see you live at 1742 Meadowland Drive, 
and the phone number's 494-2366.  Your office number over at Lincoln 
Insurance is 745-2302, and your cell number's 266-2566.  Which number are 
you calling from, sir?" 
<P>
Customer: "Huh?  I'm at home.  Where d'ya get all this information?" 
<P>
Operator: "We're wired into the system, sir." 
<P>
Customer: (Sighs) "Oh, well, I'd like to order a couple of your 
All-Meat Special pizzas." 
<P>
Operator: "I don't think that's a good idea, sir." 
<P>
Customer: "Whaddya mean?" 
<P>
Operator: "Sir, your medical records indicate that you've got very high 
blood pressure and extremely high cholesterol.  Your National Health Care 
provider won't allow such an unhealthy choice." 
<P>
Customer: "Damn. What do you recommend, then?" 
<P>
Operator: "You might try our low-fat Soybean Pizza.  I'm sure you'll 
like it." 
<P>
Customer: "What makes you think I'd like something like that?" 
<P>
Operator: "Well, you checked out 'Gourmet Soybean Recipes' from your local 
library last week, sir.  That's why I made the suggestion." 
<P>
Customer: "All right, all right . Give me two family-sized ones, then." 
<P>
Operator: "That should be plenty for you, your wife and your four 
kids, sir. Your total is $49.99." 
<P>
Customer: "Lemme give you my credit card number." 
<P>
Operator: "I'm sorry sir, but I'm afraid you'll have to pay in cash. 
Your credit card balance is over its limit." 
<P>
Customer: "I'll run over to the ATM and get some cash before your 
driver gets here." 
<P>
Operator: "That won't work either, sir.  Your checking account's overdrawn." 
<P>
Customer: "Never mind.  Just send the pizzas.  I'll have the cash 
ready. How long will it take?" 
<P>
Operator: "We're running a little behind, sir.  It'll be about 45 
minutes, sir.  If you're in a hurry you might want to pick 'em up while 
you're out getting the cash, but carrying pizzas on a motorcycle can be a 
little awkward." 
<P>
Customer: "How the hell do you know I'm riding a bike?" 
<P>
Operator: "It says here you're in arrears on your car payments, so 
your car got repo'ed.  But your Harley's paid up. 
<P>
Customer: "@#%/$@&amp;?#!&amp;?#!" 
<P>
Operator: "I'd advise watching your language, sir.  You've already 
got a July 2006 conviction for cussing out a cop." 
<P>
Customer: (Speechless) 
<P>
Operator: "Will there be anything else, sir?" 
<P>
Customer: "Yes, I have a coupon for a free 2 liter of Coke." 
<P>
Operator: "I'm sorry sir, but our ad's exclusionary clause prevents us 
from offering free soda to diabetics." 
<P>
