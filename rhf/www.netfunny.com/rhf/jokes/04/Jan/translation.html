O Shit: The situation is serious, and misfortune is hot on my ass,<BR>

<P>
&gt; By God, I am keen on safeguarding your religion and your worldly life.<BR>
<P>
By God, if I am extremely lucky, you guys will do something to bail me<BR>
out this mess...because I sure have no tricks to pull out of my ass,<BR>
which as I mentioned is grass. Somebody? Anybody?<BR>
<P>
&gt; So, lend me your ears and open up your hearts to me so that we may examine<BR>
&gt; these pitch-black misfortunes and so that we may consider how we can find<BR>
&gt; a way out of these adversities and calamities.<BR>
<P>
HELP ME, GODDAMMIT! SOMEBODY FUCKING HELP ME! FUCK!<BR>
<P>
&gt; It has become clear that the rulers are not qualified to apply the<BR>
&gt; religion and defend the Muslims.<BR>
<P>
Shit. Those bastards in Saudia Arabia lied out their m***ing asses to<BR>
me. Damn.<BR>
<P>
&gt; In fact, they have provided evidence that they are implementing the<BR>
&gt; schemes of the enemies of the nation and religion and that they are<BR>
&gt; qualified to abandon the countries and peoples.<BR>
<P>
By Allah and boy howdy, did I misunderestimate....it's nice to view<BR>
myself, and be seen by you all as a post-historical Robin Hood with<BR>
hyper-destructive weapons and all, but shit, that m***er Bush is<BR>
serious about killing my ass dead.<BR>
<P>
Dead. You people hear me? Hello? Is this thing on? Hello? Hello?<BR>
<P>
&gt; Despite the great importance of these rituals, the religion of Islam<BR>
&gt; encompasses all the affairs of life, including religious and worldly<BR>
&gt; affairs, such as economic, military and political affairs, as well as the<BR>
&gt; scales by which we weigh the actions of men - rulers, ulema and others -<BR>
&gt; and how to deal with the ruler in line with the rules set by God for him<BR>
&gt; and which the ruler should not violate.<BR>
<P>
As I reflect upon the meaningless piece of shit my life has become, I<BR>
am saying my prayers while kissing my ass goodbye. Damn, I fucked up.<BR>
