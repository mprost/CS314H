</PRE>Q: How many presidential candidates does it take to change a light bulb? 
<P>
Clark:  This dead bulb is a serious national security problem.  You can't 
fight terrorism in the dark.  It's not just a one-sided mechanical 
problem, it's a vision problem.  It's about persuading people that the 
light bulb needs to be changed.  And I'm the only one of us who's gone out 
and bought light bulbs and changed them.  I've changed them in Bosnia. 
Those Serb snipers kept shooting 'em out, and I put new ones right back 
in. 
<P>
Dean:  The insiders in Washington want you to believe that only they can 
change the light bulb!  The power to bring light to this room is in your 
hands!  It's time to take the ladder back!  YOU HAVE THE POWER!  YOU HAVE 
THE POWER!  YEEAAAAAGGGGHHH! 
<P>
Edwards:  I have spent my life fighting against powerful special interests 
that keep you in the dark, that keep you from getting the light you 
deserve.  Who's in the best position to change this light bulb, people 
who've spent their lives in politics, letting lobbyists write our energy 
bills, or someone who will stand up for you against these powerful 
interests that are taking your light away? 
<P>
Gephardt:  We need a whole new approach to lighting this room.  We've had 
to deal with Republicans who say they want us to have light but don't want 
to pay for the bulb.  We're not coming up with a long-term policy that 
will reduce our dependence on foreign-made light bulbs.  And I've spent a 
lot of time at the top of a ladder thinking about how to get that done. 
<P>
Graham:  10:58 - removed new bulb from box.  10:59 - climbed ladder, 
removed fixture, unscrewed old bulb.  11:00 - screwed new bulb in, 
replaced fixture.  11:01 - threw out old bulb.  11:02 - made sandwich. 
<P>
Kerry:  Eighteen months ago I voted not to change the light bulb, and I 
stand by that vote, because I trusted our president when he said the bulb 
did not need to be changed.  Now I feel differently, and I realize that 
the bulb does need to be changed.  I'm not in favor of putting in a 
100-watt bulb.  I believe what we need at this time is a 75-watt bulb. 
But these crooked, lying Republicans will tell you that you're un-American 
if you say we need light at all. 
<P>
Kucinich:  I'm telling you, compact fluorescents last three years on 
average and use one-fourth the power of incandescent bulbs.  Why won't you 
listen to me? 
<P>
Lieberman:  Howard Dean would plunge us into an era of darkness that would 
last NINE HUNDRED YEARS. 
<P>
Moseley Braun:  At some point we have to show that women have a role in 
changing light bulbs too. 
<P>
Sharpton:  When you let this bulb go out, you let hope go out in the 
hearts of the disenfranchised people in this country who need light. 
They've got plenty of light up in the clubhouse, but they want to send the 
people out to the doghouse.  They're afraid that if the light comes on, 
we'll see their hands in our pockets.  You can't spell "greed" without 
"GE." 
<P>
Bush:  We've got a war going on.  Now is not the time to be changing light 
bulbs. 
<P>
Nader:  These mass concentrations of power, privilege, and wealth have 
placed their rampaging global quest for maximum profits in the way of 
bringing light to the millions of excluded, expendable workers who make 
the bulbs and ... hey, wait!  Where are you going?  Come back here! 
<P>
Roy Moore:  All light comes from God.
