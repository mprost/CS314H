</PRE>NAMING THE FATHER FOR CHILD SUPPORT IN ENGLAND 
<P>
The following are all replies that British women have put on Child 
Support Agency forms in the section for listing the father's details: 
<P>
These are 'genuine' excerpts from the forms. 
<P>
01. Regarding the identity of the father of my twins, child A was 
fathered by Jim Munson. I am unsure as to the identity of the father 
of child B, but I believe that he was conceived on the same night. 
<P>
02. I am unsure as to the identity of the father of my child as I was 
being sick out of a window when taken unexpectedly from behind. I can 
provide you with a list of names of men that I think were at the party 
if this helps. 
<P>
03. I do not know the name of the father of my little girl. She was 
conceived at a party at 3600 Grand Avenue where I had unprotected sex 
with a man I met that night. I do remember that the sex was so good 
that I fainted. If you do manage to track down the father can you send 
me his phone number? Thanks. 
<P>
04. I don't know the identity of the father of my daughter. He drives 
a BMW that now has a hole made by my stiletto in one of the door panels. 
Perhaps you can contact BMW service stations in this area and see if 
he's had it replaced. 
<P>
05. I have never had sex with a man. I am awaiting a letter from the 
Pope confirming that my son's conception was immaculate and that he is 
Christ risen again. 
<P>
06. I cannot tell you the name of child A's dad as he informs me 
that to do so would blow his cover and that would have cataclysmic 
implications for the British economy. I am torn between doing right 
by you and right by the country. Please advise. 
<P>
07. I do not know who the father of my child was as all squaddies look 
the same to me. I can confirm that he was a Royal Green Jacket. 
<P>
08. Peter Smith is the father of child A. If you do catch up with him 
can you ask him what he did with my AC/DC CDs? 
<P>
09. From the dates it seems that my daughter was conceived at 
EuroDisney - maybe it really is the Magic Kingdom. 
<P>
10. So much about that night is a blur. The only thing that I remember 
for sure is Delia Smith did a program about eggs earlier in the evening. 
If I'd have stayed in and watched more TV rather than going to the party 
at 146 Miller Drive, mine might have remained unfertilised. 
<P>
11. I am unsure as to the identity of the father of my baby, after all 
when you eat a can of beans you can't be sure which one made you fart. 
<P>
[Note - making the rounds for the past few months, anonymous, and probably 
apocryphal - ed]
