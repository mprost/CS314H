This test has been designed to evaluate reactions of management 
personnel to various situations. 
<P>
<PRE>You are making a sales presentation to a group of corporate executives 
in the plushest office you've ever seen.  The enchillada casserole and 
egg salad sandwich you had for lunch react, creating severe pressure. 
Your sphincter loses control and you break wind, causing the glass 
bookcase doors to shatter and a secretary to pass out. 
<P>
YOU SHOULD: 
<P>
(A)  Offer to come back next week when the smell has gone away. 
(B)  Point to the Chief Executive and accuse him of the offense. 
(C)  Challenge anyone in the room to do better. 
<P>
<HR>
You have just returned from a trip to Green Bay, Wisconsin in January 
and tell your boss that nobody but whores and football players live 
there.  He mentions that his wife is from Green Bay.  YOU SHOULD: 
<P>
(A)  Pretend you are suffering from amnesia and don't remember your 
     name. 
(B)  Ask what position she played. 
(C)  Ask if she is still working the streets. 
<P>

</PRE>Back in the good ole days in Texas, when stagecoaches and the like was 
popular, there were three people in a stagecoach one day: a true red-blooded 
born-and-raised Texas gentleman, a tenderfoot city-slicker from 
back East, and a beautiful and well-endowed Texas lady.  The city-slicker 
kept eyeing the lady, and finally he leaned forward and said, 
"Lady, I'll give you $10 for a blow job." 
<P>
The Texas gentleman looked 
appalled, pulled out his pistol, and killed the city-slicker on the 
spot.  The lady gasped and said, "Thank you, suh, for defendin' mah 
honor!" 
<P>
Whereupon the Texan holstered his gun and said, "Your honor, 
hell!!  No tenderfoot is gonna raise the price of women in Texas!!" 
<P>
