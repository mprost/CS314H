One day an old jewish pole, living in Warsaw, has his last light bulb 
burn out.  To get a new one he'll have to stand in line for two hours 
at the store (and they'll probably be out by the time he gets there), 
so he goes up to his attic and starts rummaging around for an old oil 
lamp he vaguely remembers seeing. 
<P>
He finds the old brass lamp in the bottom of a trunk that has seen 
better days.  He starts to polish it and (poof!) a genie appears in 
cloud of smoke. 
<P>
"Hoho, Mortal!" says the genie, stretching and yawning, "For releasing 
me I will grant you three wishes." 
<P>
The old man thinks for a moment, and says, "I want Genghis Khan 
resurrected.  I want him to re-unite his mongol hordes, march to the 
Polish border, and then decide he doesn't want the place and march 
back home." 
<P>
"No sooner said than done!" thunders the genie.  "Your second wish?" 
<P>
"Ok.  I want Genghis Khan resurrected.  I want him to re-unite his 
mongol hordes, march to the Polish border, and then decide he doesn't 
want the place and march back home." 
<P>
"Hmmm.  Well, all right.  Your third wish?" 
<P>
"I want Genghis Khan resurrected.  I want him to re-unite his --" 
<P>
"Okokok.  Right.  What's this business about Genghis Khan marching to 
Poland and turning around again?" 
<P>
The old man smiles.  "He has to pass through Russia six times."
