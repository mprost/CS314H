YOUR CO-WORKER COULD BE A SPACE ALIEN, SAY EXPERTS ... here's how you can 
tell (by Michael Cassels of the "National Inquirer") 
<P>
Many Americans work side by side with space aliens who look human - 
but you can spot these visitors by looking for certain 
tip-offs, say experts. 
<P>
They listed 10 signs to watch for: 
<P>
1. Odd or mismatched clothes.  "Often space aliens don't fully 
understand the different styles, so they wear combinations 
that are in bad taste, such as checked pants with a striped 
shirt or a tuxedo jacket with blue jeans or sneakers," noted 
Brad Steiger, a renowned UFO investigator and author. 
<P>
2. Strange diet or unusual eating habits.  Space aliens might 
eat French fires with a spoon or gobble down large amounts of 
pills, the experts say. 
<P>
3. Bizarre sense of humor.  Space aliens who don't understand 
earthly humor may laugh during a serious company training film 
or tell jokes that no one understands, said Steiger. 
<P>
4. Takes frequent sick days.  A space alien might need extra 
time off to "rejuvenate its energy," said Dr. Thomas Easton, 
a theoretical biologist and futurist. 
<P>
5. Keeps a written or tape recorded diary.  "Aliens are constantly 
gathering information." said Steiger. 
<P>
6. Misuses everyday items. "A space alien may use correction fluid 
to paint its nails," said Steiger. 
<P>
7. Constant questioning about customs of co-workers.  Space aliens 
who are trying to learn about earth culture might ask questions that 
seem stupid, Easton said. 
<P>
"For example, a co-worker may ask why so many Americans picnic on 
the Fourth of July," noted Steiger. 
<P>
8. Secretive about personal life-style and home.  "An alien won't 
discuss domestic details or talk about what it does at night or 
on weekends," said Steiger. 
<P>
9. Frequently talks to himself. "An alien may not be used to 
speaking as we do, so an alien may practice speaking," Steiger noted. 
<P>
10. Displays a change of mood or physical reaction when near certain 
high-tech hardware. "An alien may experience a mood change when a 
microwave oven is turned on," said Steiger.  The experts pointed out 
that a co-worker would have to display most if not all of these 
traits before you can positively identify him as a space alien.
