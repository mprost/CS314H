It was finals week at the college. The students had filed into the 
auditorium, and picked up their blue-books for the test. This particular 
class had been in aviaian biology and identification. The professor 
was known to give very difficult finals, and weighed them heavily in 
the grade. 
<P>
Looking down to the table in the front of the room, the students 
saw several stands with stuffed and mounted birds. They could see that 
they were birds, as the feet were visible below the burlap sacks that 
had been placed over them. And beside each was a small sign with a 
number. 
<P>
The bell rang, the professor allowed a moment for the noise to die 
down, and them addressed the class. "Today's final will count, as you 
know, for a large percentage of the grade. But the directions for the 
test are simple. You are to identify each of the birds on the table 
before you. Write the number, and the latin and common name of the 
creature associated with it, on your paper. When you have completed the 
identifications, you may leave. Begin."  With that he sat down. 
<P>
One of the students, a few rows back from the front gestured for 
the profs attention, and asked a question, "Uh, professor, are you 
going to remove the sacks so we can see the birds?" 
<P>
"No... If you've been following the lectures through the term, you 
should be able to identify each of them by its feet alone. You should 
have realized the areas that I was stressing, in class and in the 
reading assignments." 
<P>
The student, becoming a little alarmed, "You mean, you expect 
us to be able to know one of these from the others just by its feet. 
That's unreasonable." 
<P>
"I'm sorry you're dismayed by this test. Perhaps if you'll begin 
it'll go better than you expect, and then the others can begin 
also." 
<P>
"No, this is absurd. I'm not going to take this test. This is 
outrageous. I'm leaving." And the student begins to gather up his 
pencils, and day-pack. 
<P>
"If you're leaving, tell me your name, so I can mark you off in my 
book now, please." 
<P>
The irate student, holding up his feet so the 
prof can see them, replies, "YOU FIGURE IT OUT!"
