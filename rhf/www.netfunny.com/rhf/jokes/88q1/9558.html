I was walking in the park one bright sunny Sunday afternoon, when 
I noticed a cute little girl out walking her dog.  As she approached 
me on the path, she looked about 9 years old, all dressed up in 
her Sunday best, and her freshly scrubbed face, just gleaming with 
cutsiness.  Tugging on her leash was a well groomed terrier. 
<P>
As we met on the path, I greeted her, "Hi there, my, aren't you 
pretty today and what a fine looking dog you have." 
<P>
"Thank you, sir" she said, "And what a nice day this is isn't it?" 
<P>
"Yes it is" I answered, "My, what a polite little girl you are, and 
what a pretty dress you're wearing." 
<P>
"Oh, thank you, sir.  My mother taught me to always be polite and 
she made this dress for me, isn't it pretty?" she said with a 
beaming smile. 
<P>
"Yes, very pretty" I answered, "By the way, what's your dog's name?" 
<P>
"Oh, sir, my dog's name is 'Porky', isn't that cute?" 
<P>
"Well, it certainly is an unusual name for a dog.  Why do you call 
him 'Porky'?" 
<P>
"Because he fucks pigs!" 
<P>
