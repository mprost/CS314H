A poor little lonely old lady lived in a house with only her cat as a friend. 
One day, the lights went out as she sat knitting; she had been unable to pay 
the electric bill.  So, she went up to the attic and got an old oil lamp from 
her childhood. As she rubbed it clean a genie appeared and allowed her three 
wishes. 
<P>
``First, I want to be so rich I never have to worry about money again.'' 
<P>
``Second, I want to be young and beautiful again.'' 
<P>
``And last, I want you to change my little cat into a handsome prince.'' 
<P>
*POOF* 
<P>
As the smoke cleared she saw she was surrounded by big bags of coins, and 
that in the mirror was a young beautiful woman.  She turned as the handsome 
prince walked in the door, held her in his arms and said, 
"Now I'll bet you're sorry you took me to the vet for that little operation." 
<P>
