(This joke is from a professor who refered to lawyers as the second 
oldest profession:) 
<P>
There once was a dog show to determine the world's smartest dog.  Three 
dogs were in the finals. One dog belonged to a doctor.  One dog belonged 
to an engineer.  And, one dog belonged to a lawyer. 
<P>
For the finals each dog was given a bag of bones to see what it could 
make. 
<P>
The doctor said, "Stethascope, go!"  The dog built a human skeleton. 
<P>
The judges were ready to award the trophy right then.  But, they decided 
to give the other dogs a try. 
<P>
The engineer said, "Slide-rule, go!" (So, its an old joke.)  The dog built 
a suspension bridge. 
<P>
The judges were beside themselves.  Which dog would they pick? 
<P>
The lawyer said. "Loop-hole, go!"  The dog ate the bones, got a percentage 
of all the tolls from the bridge and screwed the other two dogs. 
<P>
