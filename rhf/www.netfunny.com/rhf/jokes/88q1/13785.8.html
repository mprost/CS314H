Origin:  Unknown (actually, I wrote the first one a few months ago, but 
I thought "origin: unknown" looks cool) 
<P>
Revision 1:  Dec. 2, 1987  by Joe Talmadge 
<P>
In the time I have been posting to net, I have encountered flame wars 
of epic proportions (Brahms Gang vs. Tim Maroney), and flame wars of a 
more modest nature (MIT vs. CIT).  Flaming has evolved into a 
highly-stylized art form, complete with unwritten rules and guidelines. 
<P>
Here, I have attempted to document the Art of Flaming, in such a way 
as it will be interesting to old hands (flame masters) and novices 
(virgins) alike.  Without a further ado, then, I present: 
<P>
<H4>The twelve commandments of flaming</H4>
<P>
<!--  list-->
<OL><LI>Make things up about your opponent:  It's important to make your lies 
sound true.  Preface your argument with the word "clearly." 
"Clearly, Fred Flooney is a liar, and a dirtball to boot." 
<LI>Be an armchair psychologist:  You're a smart person.  You've 
heard of Freud.  You took a psychology course in college. 
Clearly, you're qualified to psychoanalyze your opponent. 
"Polly Purebread, by using the word 'zucchini' in her posting, 
shows she has a bad case of penis envy." 
<LI>Cross-post your flames:  Everyone on the net is just waiting for 
the next literary masterpiece to leave your terminal.  From 
rec.arts.wobegon to alt.gourmand, they're all holding their 
breaths until your next flame.  Therefore, post everywhere. 
<LI>Conspiracies abound:  If everyone's against you, the reason 
can't <B>possibly</B> be that you're a fuckhead.  There's obviously 
a conspiracy against you, and you will be doing the entire 
net a favor by exposing it. 
<LI>Lawsuit threats:  This is the reverse of Rule #4 (sort of like the 
Yin &amp; Yang of flaming).  Threatening a lawsuit is always 
considered to be in good form.  "By saying that I've posted 
to the wrong group, Bertha has libeled me, slandered me, 
and sodomized me.  See you in court, Bertha." 
<LI>Force them to document their claims:  Even if Harry Hoinkus 
states outright that he likes tomato sauce on his pasta, you 
should demand documentation.  If Newsweek hasn't written 
an article on Harry's pasta preferences, then Harry's obviously 
lying. 
<LI>Use foreign phrases:  French is good, but Latin is the lingua franca 
of flaming.  You should use the words "ad hominem" at least 
three times per article.  Other favorite Latin phrases are 
"ad nauseum," "vini, vidi, vici," and "fetuccini alfredo." 
<LI>Tell 'em how smart you are:  Why use intelligent arguments to 
convince them you're smart when all you have to do is tell 
them?  State that you're a member of Mensa or Mega or Dorks 
of America.  Tell them the scores you received on every exam 
since high school.  "I got an 800 on my SATs, LSATs, GREs, 
MCATs, and I can also spell the word 'premeiotic' ." 
<LI>Accuse your opponent of censorship.  It is your right as an American 
citizen to post whatever the hell you want to the net (as 
guaranteed by the 37th Amendment, I think).  Anyone who tries 
to limit your cross-posting or move a flame war to email is 
either a communist, a fascist, or both. 
<LI>Doubt their existence:  You've never actually seen your opponent, 
have you?  And since you're the center of the universe, you 
should have seen them by now, shouldn't you?  Therefore, THEY 
DON'T EXIST!  This is the beauty of flamers' logic. 
<LI>Lie, cheat, steal, leave the toilet seat up. 
<LI>When in doubt, insult:  If you forget the other 11 rules, remember 
this one.  At some point during your wonderful career as a flamer 
you will undoubtedly end up in a flame war with someone who is 
better than you.  This person will expose your lies, tear 
apart your arguments, make you look generally like a bozo.  At 
this point, there's only one thing to do:  insult the dirtbag!!! 
"Oh yeah?  Well, your mother does strange things with vegetables." 
</OL>
<P>
<H4>The Golden Rule of Flaming</H4>
<P>
My flames will be witty, insulting, interesting, funny, caustic, or 
sarcastic, but never, ever, will they be boring. 
<P>
Here endeth the scriptures.
