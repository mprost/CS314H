Okay, you free-love atheist swine.  It's time to put down your filthy 
bitmapped bimbos and your smutty newsgroups and sit up straight. 
Pastor Stephan is going to save your miserable asses from eternal 
damnation.  You can buy me large plots of land later. 
<P>
For todays lesson we will be covering a topic of historic and 
lexicographic interest.  As you know, in ancient and Biblical times 
the inhabitants of the Middle East had a lot of time on their hands. 
(Hence the Sons of Abraham-- three faiths [Judaism, Christianity, 
Islam] sharing theology, prophets, sacred sites, and even sacred 
texts-- and yet each works for the destruction and expulsion of the 
other two!)  A side effect of this was tolerance for extremely long 
proper names. 
<P>
Amazingly enough, many of these names have entered the English 
language.  And so, in the interest of spiritual enlightenment and 
building power vocabularies, allow me to present... 
<P>
<CENTER>THE TOP FIFTEEN RIDICULOUSLY LONG BIBLICAL NAMES</CENTER><BR>
<P>
15) Abelbethmaachah: Kings 1 15:20, Kings 2 15:29.  A city in Israel. 
MODERN USAGE: Euphemism to describe two people you don't know making 
love.  EXAMPLE: "Yeah, that Earth First! rally was disgusting.  Never 
seen so much sleeping-bag abelbethmaachah in my life." 
<P>
14) Almondiblathaim: Numbers 33:46-47.  Another Israeli settlement. 
MODERN USAGE: Insult.  The literal translation out of the Hebrew is 
"Place of men who blather about almonds all the time"; thus, 
almondiblathaim is used to mean people who go on and on about 
something you could give a hoot about.  EXAMPLE: "Oh, great, the 
programmers are coming over.  Don't ask them how work is going; 
instant almondiblathaim." 
<P>
13) Apharsathchites: Ezra 4:9.  Inhabitants of yet another city. 
MODERN USE: Geological techspeak.  EXAMPLE: "No, you knucklehead. 
Apharsathchites have don't mica inclusions, now, do they?  Which means 
this is?  Think... come on... Christ!  It's GRANITE, you pinhead!" 
<P>
12) Berodachbaladan: Kings 2 20:12.  King of Babylon.  MODERN USAGE: 
Medical assistant techspeak. Used to describe the sound a full bedpan 
makes when dropped. 
<P>
11) Helkathhazzurim: Samuel 2 2:16. Battlefield in Gibeon. MODERN 
USAGE: Onomatopoetic description of accidental death resulting from a 
stream of urine striking an electrified third rail. 
<P>
10) Merodachbaladan: Isaiah 39:1. Another spelling of Berodachbaladan, 
King of Babylon.  MODERN USAGE: Medical assistant techspeak: Used to 
describe the sound a full bedpan makes when dropped on a doctor's 
foot. 
<P>
9) Ramathaimzophim: Samuel 1 1:1. Samuel's home town on Mount Ephraim. 
MODERN USAGE: Stew produced by a collective.  EXAMPLE: "Hey, I bet 
some crab meat would go really well in this!"  "Go ahead, Al!  It's a 
ramathaimzophim!" 
<P>
8) Tilgathpilneser: Chronicles 1 5:6, 5:20; Chronicles 2 28:20.  King 
of Assyria.  MODERN USE: A specific type of potent Czechoslovakian 
pilsner prepared with ox tails. 
<P>
7) Zaphnathpaaneah: Genesis 41:45.  Joseph's Egyptian name.  MODERN 
USAGE: The practice of freebasing mothballs. 
<P>
6) Bashanhavothjair: Deuteronomy 3:14.  The name Jair son of Manasseh 
gave to the country of Argob.  MODERN USAGE: The practice of achieving 
hegemony over a patch of land the size of an olive pit, naming it 
after yourself with a five syllable jawbreaker, and then proceeding 
straight into historical oblivion. 
<P>
5) Chepharhaammonai: Joshua 18:24.  Still another Israeli city. 
MODERN USAGE: The practice of pretending ham is chipped beef, still 
practiced by guilty members of the faithful to this day. 
<P>
4) Kibrothhattaavah: Numbers 11:34-35, 33:16-17; Deuteronomy 9:22.  A 
cute bit in the wandering of the Jews in the desert.  Chapter 11: 
Everybody's in the desert.  They're getting sick of manna.  People 
start wondering why they left Egypt; they ask Moses for flesh.  Moses 
talks to YHVH.  YHVH promises 30 days of flesh.  YHVH send a great 
cloud of quails.  People pig out.  And then: 
<P>
11:33 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere 
it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the 
people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague. 
<P>
11:34 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: 
because there they buried the people that lusted. 
<P>
MODERN USAGE: Fast food meat contaminated with feces. 
<P>
3) Selahammahlekoth: Samuel 1 23:28.  Where Saul laid off the pursuit 
of David and went off to beat up the Philistines. MODERN USAGE: the 
amount of sexual humor one can make in the workplace without being hit 
with a sexual harassment lawsuit. 
<P>
2) Chushanrishathaim: Judges 3:8-10.  King of Mesopotamia.  YHVH got 
ticked at the Jews because they "served Baalim and the groves" [Judges 
3:7] and so Chushanrishathaim got to enslave them for eight years. 
MODERN USAGE: A guy who could have been a contender for serious fame, 
but wasn't allowed to be evil long enough to ensure his reputation. 
<P>
1) Mahershalalhashbaz: Isaiah 8:1, 8:3.  The child of Isaiah and "the 
prophetess."  No other mention is made of this woman. The child is 
used in Isaiah 8:4 as a measure of time ("For before the child shall 
have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of 
Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king 
of Assyria")-- and is never mentioned again.  MODERN USAGE: Fruit of a 
sexual relationship between a famous person and a bimbo-- when the 
famous person SWEARS the relationship was purely a professional one.
