<PRE>    An old man at a nursing home is about to have his 90th birthday party. 
    His friends at the home all decide to pool their resources and get him
    a present.  When he walks into the darkened rec room, they turn on the
    lights and yell "SURPRISE!"  Well, later in the party, a few of his
    friends mention that there was still more of a surprise left - he
    should go to his room to see what it was.  So, the man walks down the
    hall to his room, opens his door, and there is a beautiful buxom young
    lady dressed in nothing but a silk teddy.  He asks, "what are you doing
    here?" 
    
    "I'm part of the surprise," she answered.  "I'm here to give you 
    super sex."
    
    "OK," the man said.
 
    "I'll take the soup."
