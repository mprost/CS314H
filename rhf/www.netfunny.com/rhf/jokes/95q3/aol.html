[This is an original creation except as noted below] 
<P>
[For the occassional hermit out there without a mail drop, America Online 
has been distributing "10 Hours Free" disks like crazy.  They come with 
magazines, they come by themselves, they are attached to trade journals 
etc.  I have about ten of them now.  I have never expressed an interest 
in AOL but these disks keep mounting up.] 
<P>
Things to do about all of your AOL disks. 
<P>
<!--  list-->
<OL><LI>Collect two solar masses worth and detonate the sun. [copied from 
a signature seen on the net.] 
<LI>Activate each account with a different cartoon character name like 
Bullwinkle, Barney Rubble, Tasmanian Devil, etc.  See if you run out 
of names before you run out of disks. 
<LI>Activate the disks one at a time.  For each disk you activate, download 
enough files to fill up the reformatted activation disk.  Don't stop 
until you have downloaded all data AOL has to offer.  Use remaining 
unactivated disks for backup of downloaded data. 
<LI>Get 1000 people to all activate all of their disks at the same time. 
Monitor trade journals to see which disk storage manufacturer gets 
AOL's order for new multi-terabyte drive to hold subscriber 
data base. 
<LI>Tile your bathroom with your collection.  Submit picture of bathroom 
to GQ (Geek Quarterly) magazine. 
<LI>Donate disks to charity.  Tell IRS that each disk contains $10 worth 
of software.  Use resulting deductions to buy Lichtenstein. 
<LI>Call the FBI and tell them that these disks are made from refined uranium 
and homes across the country will begin exploding as soon as they 
reach critical mass. 
<LI>Activate all of your disk simultaneously using different ids. Making 
effective use of mail forwarding and distrubtion lists, bring AOL to 
a screeching halt by creating, sending, forwarding and reforwarding 
the following message among the various account:  "Stop sending 
these f*****g disks." 
<LI>Erase all disks, put new labels on them and resell them as new. Retire 
at age 43. 
<LI>Start pyramid scheme with chain letter that tells recipient to 
mail 1 disk to each of the five people listed in the letter and 
to send the letter to five more people. 
</OL>
