Subject: Answering questions before they're asked

I got this from the Sunday, August 4, 1991 Daily Bulletin of the
North American Bridge Championships:

Brian Nenninger, 15, and Andy Stark, 16, had been asked lots of questions
because of their youthful appearance.  Then they had an idea -- they would
prepare a card to show their opponents each round!  Here's what they
came up with:

        West: Brian Nenninger, 15
        East: Andy Stark, 16
                We are not related.
                We live in northern Virginia.
                We have been playing for about a year.
                Our parents are not here and don't play.
                We learned to play at school.
        Further questions: $30 each

Forwarded to me by my brother... i've no idea where it came from...

 &lt;headers removed&gt;

         This is from the Stanford Univ. BBoard

 Did you all see that article in the Sunday Examiner about yawning?
 Page 3 of the Sunday Punch section, in case you missed it.

 Three clinical psychiatrists had a paper in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry
 entitled "Unusual Side Effects of Clomipramine Associated with Yawning",
 describing 4 patients who, while taking the the anti-depressant drug
 Clomipramine (brand name Anafranil) reported the unusual side effect of
 spontaneous orgasm every time they yawned.

 The first case of this was a female patient who had been depressed for 3
 months, but under treatment "Complete symptom remission occurred within 10
 days". She then asked how long she would be allowed to go on using the drug,
 since she had observed that every time she yawned she had an orgasm, and she
 was able to experience orgasm by deliberate yawning.

 Apparently it can work for guys too. One male patient said that while he
 found the repeated climaxes "awkward and embarrassing, he elected to continue
 the medication because of the therapeutic benefit he obtained. The awkwardness
 and embarrassment were overcome by continuously wearing a condom."

The news reported today that the much anticipated opening of 
Christo's latest environmental artwork, a collection of 4000 twenty
foot umbrellas along I-5 in Northern California, had been delayed
for one day.

Because of rain.

Subject: PC speak

I heard, recently, on BBC Radio 4 of PC and its use in
the States.

I understand that PC lingo for `black' (as in one's skin
colour) is now `African American'.

The announcer told of one reporter who
was desparately trying to be PC and asked 

``Now Mr. Mandela, as an African American, how
does it feel.......''

Subject: Snakes, and Fishes, and Computers

At last night's Unix Unanimous meeting David Tilbrook was raving about
the performance of HP's new Snake computer, having just taken delivery
of one the day before.  Convinced of the quality of the machine, but
wondering if it was actually shipping to mere mortals, someone asked:
"What would happen if I phoned HP and told them I wanted a Snake?"
Without hesitation, Evan Leibovitch replied: "They'd send you a salesman."

(Reminds me of one David Tilbrook told the other day:)

Q: What's the difference between a catfish and a computer salesman?
A: One's a bottom-dwelling, scum-sucking scavenger, and the other's some
kind of a fish.

Subject: Message of the Day

The following is a paraphrase of the start up message that appeared
on our ULTRIX workstation.  The orginal was accidentally lost when
we tried to use the machine to do something useful.


Well, boys and girls, the forces of light have once again defeated
the forces of darkness (known as ULTRIX) and we have completed the
system upgrade.

After consulting with a numerologist, we decided that 4.0 was unlucky
and have gone directly to version 4.1.

In doing the upgrade we have attempted to return the system to the
same basic condition it was in when we started.  We have, of course,
failed in this attempted and that program that you were depending on
will no longer work.  That's not really very important, however, since
the data file that contained the accumulated results of your academic
career has also been destroyed.  You should report all such problems
to us so that we can say, "Gee, that's too bad."  We might even try to
do something about it; you never can tell.

By the way, neither the printers nor the mail system are working at
the moment.

Have a nice day!

 Did anyone notice in the news the other night where Pres. Bush was talking to
to a police convention or something, and he said that "..We will not rest until
all the hostages are free..."
  He is presently on a month vaction in Maine and took out time to go and
speak at this police convention.

From clari.canada.trouble: (copyrighted)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
	(VANCOUVER) The cleanup continues following an early morning
explosion on Vancouver's west side. Two restaurants, ``DYNAMITE PIZZA''
and the Orchid Garden Singapore-Thai restaurant, were levelled. Several
other businesses suffered heavy damage.
	Fire officials believe the explosion was caused by a restaurant
worker who was using gas to clean an oven. He's in criticial condition
with second and third degree burns to his entire body. The blast knocked
out windows more than one-hundred feet away and there are huge plates of
glass all over the street and shards litter the sidewalks. Two banks have
had their windows blown out, so police have sealed the area to prevent
looting.

I do not want to receive a daily paper at home, but that doesn't stop the
sales people from coming to my door.  A few months ago, one such person made
the mistake to ring my doorbell.  I really don't like to be rude, so I told
him I was illiterate, so a getting a daily paper would be a waste.  His only
comment was "I'm really sorry!", then he turned and walked away... haven't had
a newspaper peddler come by since!

Subject: Heard at a little league game - true story

My son was playing center field in a baseball game the other night.  At his
level (he's 7) center field is about 6 feet behind second base.  With a runner
on first, the next batter hit one right up the middle.  When it got to my son
a bad bounce ;-) caused him to miss the ball, but it bounced off his chest
right to the second baseman for the force out.  When the inning was over he
ran up to me and in an excited voices said, "Did you see what happened?  Boy 
its a good thing I have great reflections!"

Subject: Ties and the Macintrash

Jon Bentley started a presentation on prototyping, little
languages, etc.  He was going to use awk as a vehicle in this
presentation, so he started off by saying "In case you don't
already know awk, do not fear: it's a lot like C.  Consider, for
example, this trivial awk program".  He put a slide into the
overhead projector containing a simple awk program.

Suddenly, the flow of the presentation choked.  He looked hard at
the screen, obviously stumped by his own tiny awk program.
Finally, inspiration shone upon his face.  Urgently, he tore his
tie off and flung it across the floor.  "It's really true, you 
<i>can't</i> program with a tie on!".
_________________________

One day, a marketing guy came in to sit in a technical meeting.
As he marched into the room, the chairman of the meeting walked
up close to him and carefully undid his tie, saying  "This is an
engineering meeting.  You need the blood to flow to your head".

About a year ago, a study published in _Academic_Computing_
entitled "Student Writing: Can the Machine Main the Message"
suggested that college freshmen using Macintoshes wrote poorer
essays than students using DOS-based computers.

The researcher ran the compositions through the Unix Writer's
Workbench and tallied the scores.  She also graded them by hand.
Apart from inferior writing quality, she also found that students
using PCs, generally speaking, created more coherent work on more
serious issues (like crime, the death penalty and abortion) as
compared with Macintosh users, who wrote about fast food and
graffiti.

(
 Notice that this was a while ago, before Windoze.
 What do you think freshman students who used TeX wrote about?
