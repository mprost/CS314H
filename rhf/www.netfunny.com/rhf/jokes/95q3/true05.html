[Note - What follows is one part of the True News Digest - a collection of
	true-life stories which didn't really warrant individual posting, but
	which are amusing nevertheless.  The digest is quite long, and it will
	appear in 22 parts over the next few months - ed.]

Subject: Breakfast ... or is it ... ??

I was sat in the pub with a few friends, playing pool and whatever, when 
someone asked me whether I'd made a move with a girl I fancied. The landlord
took us up on this, and said "I'll give you the one chat-up line she can't
give you a snotty response to". Okay, said I. He told me to get her alone,
put my arm round her, kiss her gently on the cheek, and whisper in her ear :
"How do you like your eggs in the morning ??"

To which a voice came from the other side of the table :

			"Unfertilised".

[Source of the question as far as I know is Ian Warren, the landlord of my 
 local.
 Smart-arse answer courtesy of Kevin Buckler, a chemistry undergraduate at
 my university. But someone's got to be a chemistry undergraduate, I spose ...
 I don't think it's original, but it's funny, I reckon].

Subject: Folk-yolk joke

	This is one that you can pull on friends that have a good
sence of humor.

Ask: "Have you ever heard the Folk-yolk joke?"

Assuming they say no, ask: "How do you spell Folk - like good old folks?"

After they say F-O-L-K, ask: "What's the white part of an egg?"

Most often they will say "yolk," and of course, that's the yellow part.

From a recent article in clari.news.music:

"Subject: French say goodbye to favorite sinner

"       PARIS (UPI) -- Grieving fans Thursday placed packs of cigarettes and a
bottle of Scotch among the wreaths and flowers piled upon the coffin of
decadent French singer songwriter Serge Gainsbourg at the Montparnasse
cemetery.
"...  scores of the bereaved clambered onto bourgeois family vaults and swayed
to the strains of such favorites from the chain-smoking, whisky-loving
crooner as ``Lemon incest'' ..."


Well, maybe he was their favorite sinner, after all.

You should have seen the bulletin posted outside of our Auditorium...
 Our school is performing the play "Annie", and it is the Broadway version
without Daddy Warbucks' bodyguard Punjab. So on the door it said "Sorry, no
Punjabs". You should have seen the review THAT one got in the local newspaper.

I saw the following classified ad in the computer section of one of the
local newspapers, March 21, 1991.  I can't remember the exact words; so
I paraphrase:

	For sale/trade: computer freak with all
	kinds of stuff, IBM/Apple/Motorola/etc.
	Call 555-1212 nights/weekends.

From:         Jim Shanesy &lt;JSHANESY@NAS.BITNET&gt;

&gt;Maybe all of that is a Massachusetts characteristic....isn't it the
&gt;Prudential Tower in boston that has had windows falling out of it
&gt;from great height?

I used to work for the Commercial Division of Honeywell, Inc. which
installed the Variable Air Volume HVAC control system in the building
to which you referred.  In a VAV system the temperature is maintained
by varying the volume of air flowing through the conditioned space,
which in turn is controlled by varying the static air pressure in the
supply ducts relative to that in the returns.  It all usually works
pretty well, but in the early days of VAV the techs who wired up the
systems were all the time forgetting to connect the return air fan,
which provides pressure relief for the air being pumped into the
space.

So when they fired up the system for the first time in the Prudential
Tower, it was like blowing up a big glass and steel balloon.  Since
the windows had been set into their frames but not cemented, out they
came.  Honeywell had to ante up plenty on that one.  Each window was
worth thousands.

This also happened at building site known as "The Pyramids" in
Indianapolis, a very avant-garde design by Kevin Roche/John Dinkleoo
Assoc. for an insurance company there.  The windows had been custom
designed and made.

Subject: Personal comments on file

Now, I'm not really <b>proud</b> of my beard.  I mean, I only have a beard 
because I hate to shave.  But I do try to keep it neat and clean, and the 
only negative comments I ever get are from females born around 1910.

I am also not fond of Radio Shack's insistence on pumping my name and 
address into the computer every time I buy another battery for my watch.

So I was reall peeved to find that my last invoice stated not that I live 
at "3118 Baird", but at "311 Hate Beard Road".

This clerk's personal comments about my face is going to be enshrined 
forever in Radio Shack's customer files?

(Maybe I should send this to "RISKS-FORUM" too.)

Subject: Parental reflexes.

Some relatives have a 5-year old boy named Jeff who has some
speech problems which include using incorrect grammar.  So, they
put him in speech therapy.  During the early stages of treatment,
they were not supposed to correct his speech, since his
self-esteem was pretty low.  But Jeff made progress and gained
some confidence, so the rule became that they were now supposed
to correct him all the time.  This is what happened soon after.

One morning, Jeff was eating his cereal, his younger sister began
to tease him mercilessly.  Rather than fight back, he finally got
up and moved to the other side of the table, muttering, "Me not
going to take that kind of crap."  Immediately, his parents
responded in unison, "*I'm* not going to take that kind of crap."

I just heard an advertisement on the radio for "Hooked on Phonics," a
cassette base course for learning how to read.

The announcer proudly proclaims 

   "To order `Hooked on Phonics' call 1-800-ABC-DEFG now!"

I wonder if 1-800-PHO-NICS was taken...

A fire in the parking area at a menudo cookoff near San Antonio
this Sunday (3/24) destroyed over 100 automobiles.  The cookoff
was sponsored by a firefighter's association.

(Menudo is a kind of Mexican soup.  Most nonhispanics would prefer
not to know the ingredients.)

INTERFAZED - The twain may never meet between Silicon Valley and Santa
Cruz, though.  Dynatech software engineer Tom Cumming and a pal were
talking about electronic mail over coffee at Jahva House in Santa Cruz
when a bearded stranger nearby looked piercingly at Cumming and said,
"Can you read my thoughts?"  Cumming, not missing a beat: "Are you on
the Internet?"

Negotiator Pro, a software tool which "teaches users how

"'I had a client who was guilty as all get out,' said ...,
an attorney in Monett, MO.  'The best plea-bargain offer
I could get was seven years in the pen.  I used Negotiator
Pro to create a profile of the prosecuting attorney and
my interaction with him.  As a result, I got my client's
sentence reduced to four years from seven years.'"
