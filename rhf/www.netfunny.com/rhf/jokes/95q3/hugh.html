From: tina@tezcat.com (Discord)
Subject: Hugh Grant is...

I was on the phone with a friend of mine tonight, and he asked if I'd
heard about the arrest of Hugh Grant.  While briefly discussing it, he
characterized Hugh Grant as

"The Englishman who went up a hill, but went down on a ho."

        =       =       =       =       =       =       =

Subject: Hugh Grant's New Film (original)


        I actually thought of this one myself:

        In light of Hugh Grant's recent involvement with the authorities,
the title of his upcoming film will be changed from "Nine Months" to...

        "Nine Months with Time Off for Good Behavior."

        =       =       =       =       =       =       =

From: naparish@uclink2.berkeley.edu (Neal A. Parish)
Subject: Hugh Grant &amp; Christopher Reeve


Q:  How is Hugh Grant different from Christopher Reeve's horse?

A:  Hugh has no problem jumping anything.

&gt;From: ronnen@eden.lbl.gov (Ronnen Levinson)
&gt;Subject: Hometown News

In the wake of Hugh Grant's automotive adventure:

Sunday's San Francisco Examiner ran a front-page article, complete with a
color photo of Stella Marie Thompson, a.k.a. Divine Brown, entitled

	Grant's hooker
	is from Bay Area
	
	Star's 'car date'
	reportedly got big
	bucks for interview

I wonder if the editors thought they were running a "local girl makes 
good" story?

&gt;Subject: New Hugh Grant movie

Hugh Grant has announced that his costar in his next
movie will be Pee Wee Herman.

Reporting this story, the UK Guardian newspaper finished, ostensibly 
unintentionally, with the comment "Mr Grant is unavailable for comment. He

Subject: Hugh for President

I think if Hugh Grant ever decides to run for President he
could use the old "She sucked but didn't swallow" excuse that
worked so well for Clinton.
