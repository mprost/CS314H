[Note - Grateful Dead lead guitarist Jerry Garcia died yesterday morning,
	reportedly of natural causes.  And so it begins.  My apologies in

We heard on the radio that Jerry Garcia died today at the age of 53. We
didn't get to hear what the cause of death was, so were forced to
speculate:

                            Drug underdose.

Q: What's the difference between Jerry Garcia and a music critic?
A: Now that one is dead, the other is gratefull.

This is original:

I was talking to an office mate about the death of Grateful
Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia.  "I guess it won't be long
before they have a commemorative stamp for him," she said.

"Yeah," I said, "a food stamp."

What's the saddest part of Jerry Garcia dying?



The deadheads having to get real jobs.
