((( Got this from a colleague. Possibly apocryphal, purportedly 
true. In any case, too good to keep quiet. Enjoy! HR ))) 
<P>
The FAA has a device for testing the strength of windshields 
on airplanes.  They point this thing at the windshield of the 
aircraft and shoot a dead chicken at about the speed the air- 
craft normally flies at it.  If the windshield doesn't break, 
it's likely to survive a real collision with a bird during 
flight. 
<P>
The British had recently built a new locomotive that could 
pull a train faster than any before it.  They were not sure 
that its windshield was strong enough so they borrowed the 
testing device from the FAA, reset it to approximate the 
maximum speed of the locomotive, loaded in the dead chicken, 
and fired.  The bird went through the windshield, broke the 
engineer's chair, and made a major dent in the back wall of 
the engine cab. 
<P>
They were quite surprised with this result, so they asked the 
FAA to check the test to see if everything was done correctly. 
The FAA checked everything and suggested that they might want 
to repeat the test using a thawed chicken.
