For non cesiophiles, cesium is the most electropositive element known, 
and as such has merited its own newsgroup alt.cesium. 
It has a number of unique properties: 
<P>
<!--  bullets-->
<UL><LI>It explodes violently on contact with water. 
<LI>It burns with a brilliant blue flame - the name cesium derives from the 
sky-blue lines in its spectrum. 
<LI>It's hydroxide (what is left after it is finished exploding with water) 
is the most powerful base known, and will eat through glass. 
<LI>It is used as the central component of cesium-beam clocks, the most accurate 
time pieces in existence. 
<LI>When consumed over a period of time, it produces a characteristic mania. 
</UL>
<P>
The following songs were posted to alt.cesium over a period of several weeks.

SONGS OF CESIUM<BR>
Translations from the Cesish<BR>
</center>
<P>
Translator's note: 
<P>
The ancient manuscripts from which these songs are derived 
are fragmentary, and consequently the accuracy of the following 
translations must be taken with a grain of Cesium Chloride. 
In places, the translator has filled in gaps to the best of his ability 
using available knowledge about the culture and traditions of ancient Cesia 
much of which, is itself controversial. 
Legitimate questions may certainly be raised, see for example, 
the comments on #117. 
To aid in perspective, the songs are presented in the order in which 
they were translated, rather than numerical order, as the translator 
learned much during the process of translation. 
The effort is an ongoing process, as the collection of available 
fragments is vast; and new translations may be added to this 
catalogue periodically. 
For now, Enjoy, Sing, and Hail Cesium!!!

Oh Cesium, oh Cesium,<BR>
Thy spectrum doth us please-ium.<BR>
Thy sky-blue lines in plasma's fire,<BR>
Do dreams of icy lakes inspire.<BR>
Oh Cesium, oh Cesium,<BR>
Thy spectrum doth us please-ium.<BR>

Oh Cesium, oh Cesium,<BR>
When held, you never freeze-ium.<BR>
Thy gently smoking silver spheres,<BR>
When dropped in water, please the ears.<BR>
Oh Cesium, oh Cesium,<BR>
When held, you never freeze-ium.<BR>

Cesium (Burning in the Dead of Night)<BR>
(Tune, Blackbird)<BR>
<P>
Cesium burning in the dead of night.<BR>
Take your sky blue lines and start to shine.<BR>
All my life,<BR>
I was only waiting for the moment you were mine.<BR>
<P>
Cesium burning on a lake of ice.<BR>
Lift your glorious flame up to the skies.<BR>
All your life,<BR>
You were only waiting for some water to arise.<BR>
<P>
Cesium burn.<BR>
Cesium burn.<BR>
Give your light to this coal black night.<BR>

Why Don't We Mix Up the Two<BR>
<P>
(Tune, "Why don't we get drunk..."<BR>
with apologies to Jimmy Buffett)<BR>
<P>
I've got a pound of Cesium,<BR>
It's burning gently near.<BR>
The sky-blue flame looks lovely,<BR>
But it's noise I want to hear.<BR>
So darlin' bring some water,<BR>
A couple pints'll do.<BR>
And why don't we mix up the two?<BR>
<P>
Why don't we mix up the two?<BR>
'Cause Cesium and water,<BR>
Really make a wicked brew.<BR>
You say I've got a death wish,<BR>
But honey, I'm just blue.<BR>
So why don't we mix up the two?<BR>

Yesterday<BR>
<P>
Yesterday.<BR>
I had Cesium with which to play<BR>
Now all my fingers have been blown away.<BR>
By cesium, since yesterday.<BR>
<P>
Yesterday.<BR>
Her sky blue flame appeared to light my way.<BR>
Now the world seems so cold and gray.<BR>
My eyes are dim since yesterday.<BR>
<P>
Why she had to blow,<BR>
I don't know,<BR>
They wouldn't say.<BR>
I used water wrong,<BR>
And my skin dissolved away.<BR>
<P>
Yesterday.<BR>
Her path seemed such an easy way.<BR>
Now I know that there's a price to pay.<BR>
Oh, I believed just yesterday.<BR>

Soon after the publication of the above translation<BR>
A mysterious monkey paid a call and pointedly insisted<BR>
that the translation of SOC #117 (Yesterday) from the Cesish was seriously<BR>
flawed, particularly in the second stanza, and offered a corrected<BR>
version, which I supply without further comment.<BR>

Yesterday<BR>
<P>
Yesterday,<BR>
I had Cesium with which to play.<BR>
Now all my fingers have been blown away.<BR>
And silence reigns since yesterday.<BR>
<P>
Suddenly,<BR>
I'm just half the man I used to be.<BR>
I have no eyes with which to see.<BR>
My legs have parted company.<BR>
<P>
Why she had to blow,<BR>
I don't know,<BR>
I can only say.<BR>
Something went awful wrong,<BR>
In the waterbed where we lay.<BR>
<P>
Yesterday,<BR>
Her sky blue path seemed such an easy way.<BR>
Now I know there is a price to pay.<BR>
Oh, I believed just yesterday.<BR>

'Lectropositive Mama<BR>
(tune, Lady Madonna)<BR>
<P>
'Letropositive mama,<BR>
Cesium on your meat,<BR>
Wonder how you manage,<BR>
To stay on your feet.<BR>
<P>
How d'ya stand the smokin'?<BR>
How d'ya 'bide the flame?<BR>
Do you think that life's just<BR>
A burnin' game.<BR>
<P>
Monday night your hunger's a blue fire,<BR>
Tuesday morn' you're cookin' 'fore the sun.<BR>
Wednesday rain, you're only flamin' higher,<BR>
Having your fun.<BR>
<P>
'Lectropositive mama,<BR>
Cinders in your curls,<BR>
No way can compare you,<BR>
To ordinary girls.<BR>
<P>
Likin' the explosions,<BR>
Rock you on your seat.<BR>
How can any woman handle<BR>
All that heat?<BR>

It's So Easy<BR>
(Tune, It's so Easy)<BR>
<P>
It's with Cesium I'm in love!<BR>
It's with Cesium I'm in love!<BR>
<P>
People say that I'm a fool,<BR>
When I take my Cesium into the pool.<BR>
And it's so easy,<BR>
So doggone easy,<BR>
Yes it's so easy,<BR>
Where my love's concerned,<BR>
To get myself burned.<BR>
But it's with Cesium I'm in love,<BR>
It's with Cesium I'm in love!<BR>
<P>
I look into her flame and see,<BR>
A sky-blue light floodin' over me.<BR>
Though it's so easy,<BR>
So doggone easy,<BR>
Yeah it's so easy,<BR>
When she's concerned,<BR>
To get myself burned.<BR>

(1)<BR>
Never know how much I need you,<BR>
Never know how much I'd dare,<BR>
When I mix you up with water,<BR>
I get a heat that's hard to bear.<BR>

I need my Cesium!<BR>
Burnin' brightly,<BR>
Cesium to give me light.<BR>
Cesium--<BR>
In the morning,<BR>
Cesium all through the night.<BR>

Sun lights up the daytime.<BR>
Moon lights up the night.<BR>
Cesium lights up heaven above,<BR>
With a brilliant sky-blue light.<BR>
<P>
I need my Cesium!<BR>
Burnin' hotly.<BR>
Cesium shinin' so bright.<BR>
Cesium--<BR>
In the morning,<BR>
Cesium to make me feel right.<BR>

(Coda)<BR>
Everybody,<BR>
Needs some Cesium,<BR>
Cesium to give 'em that glow.<BR>
Cesium--<BR>
Add some water,<BR>
Get a fire hot as down below!<BR>
<P>
(3)<BR>
Romeo, he had Cesium,<BR>
Cool water Juliette.<BR>
When they mixed it up together,<BR>
Things got as hot as they can get!<BR>
<P>
They needed Cesium!<BR>
Flamin' madly.<BR>
Cesium burnin' so blue.<BR>
Cesium--<BR>
Shared between them.<BR>
Cesium to make their love true.<BR>
<P>
(4)<BR>
Come to the end of my story.<BR>
Got to the point that I made.<BR>
Cesium's the stuff to heat you up,<BR>
And you ain't gonna find no shade!<BR>
<P>
You'll need cesium!<BR>
As you sizzle.<BR>
Cesium some comfort to earn.<BR>
Cesium--<BR>
It's almighty.<BR>
What a lovely way to burn!<BR>

Cesium Glows<BR>
(Tune, Love's a Rose - Neil Young)<BR>
<P>
Cesium glows, but you better not lick it,<BR>
It's fire grows when it's on the tongue.<BR>
Lips full of holes, you'll know you've kissed it,<BR>
Just take a bite if you want to die young.<BR>
<P>
I want to see what's never been seen,<BR>
I want to dream that Cesium dream.<BR>
Come on love, we can glow together,<BR>
Let's eat it all right now.<BR>
Take a bite right now.<BR>
<P>
I want to lie in a hole in the ground,<BR>
Six feet deep, and twelve feet 'round.<BR>
Sky blue light around me shinin',<BR>
Pale blue worms upon me dinin'.<BR>
<P>
Cesium glows, but you better not lick it,<BR>
It's fire grows when its on your tongue.<BR>
Mouth full of holes if ever you kiss it,<BR>
Gimme a spoon 'cause I wanna die Young.<BR>

Cesium's Burning<BR>

Seventy Six Neutrons<BR>
(Tune, Seventy Six Trombones)<BR>
<P>
Seventy six lithe neutrons swayed on Cesium's bar,<BR>
Half a hundred and ten bold protons...<BR>
<P>
Hold it!  Hold it!. That's Cesium 131. Half life only about 9.69 days.<BR>
Let's go for immortality here. Worth a shot anyway...<BR>
<P>
Seventy Eight Neutrons<BR>
(Tune, Seventy Six Trombones)<BR>
<P>
Seventy eight lithe neutrons swayed on Cesium's bar,<BR>
Half a hundred and ten bold protons joined the press.<BR>
And the eletronettes were a-whirling in duets,<BR>
All but one, the singular miss Six S.<BR>
<P>
Seventy eight nubile neutrons writhed in close array,<BR>
Half a hundred and ten lusty protons swelled the crowd.<BR>
And the electron pairs played blue photonic airs,<BR>
From within a shining quantum cloud.<BR>
<P>
There were pions, muons, quarks and other fermions,<BR>
Tunneling, tunneling, in a state of partial dress.<BR>
'Till an oily bit of water came a wandering,<BR>
And miss Six S got in a great big mess.<BR>
<P>
Seventy eight screaming neutrons ran and jammed the door,<BR>
Half a hundered and ten brave protons hit the ground.<BR>
There was a sky-blue flash, then nothing left but ash,<BR>
And the echo of a glorious thundering sound.<BR>

Cesium's strange,<BR>
when you're a stranger<BR>
Consummate danger,<BR>
ready to blow.<BR>
Water is wicked,<BR>
wet and unwanted,<BR>
Folks are unfriendly,<BR>
when you glow.<BR>

Don't take it out in the rain.<BR>
You're insane!<BR>
You're insane!<BR>
Don't you remember the pain?<BR>

You're insane!<BR>
You're insane ---<BR>

pregnant with danger,<BR>
Hand the next stranger<BR>
a kilo or two.<BR>
Pour on the water,<BR>
lamb at the slaughter,<BR>
Bathe in the light<BR>
that is blue, sky-blue!<BR>
<P>
Don't take it out in the rain.<BR>
You're insane!<BR>

You'll always remember the pain.<BR>
