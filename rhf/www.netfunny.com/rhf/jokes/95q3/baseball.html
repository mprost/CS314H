<PRE>This was told to me recently by an Irish friend.  Read it with
an Irish accent.

---------------------

Paddy just arrived in America from Ireland on holiday.  Now,
never having seen a baseball game before, he decides that now
would be a good time.  So, he goes to the park, and gets
himself a bleacher seat.

Now, Paddy sees a guy step up to the plate with a stick in his
hand.  The guy standing on the hump of dirt throws a ball at
the guy with the stick, who then <b>crack</b> hits the ball and
starts running down the side.  Everyone around Paddy stands up
and shouts "RUN!  RUN LIKE HELL!"

A second guy steps up to the plate, and damn, if the guy on
that hump of dirt doesn't throw that ball again.  And again, the
guy with the stick <b>crack</b> hits the ball and runs down the
side.  And again, everyone around Paddy again, stands and
shouts "RUN!  RUN LIKE HELL!"

Now, a third guy steps up to the plate with a stick in his
hands.  This time, when the guy on the hump of dirt throws the
ball, the guy with the stick doesn't do anything.  And the guy
squatting behind the guy with the stick tosses the ball back to
the guy on the hump of dirt.  And Paddy is thinking to himself,
"What's happening?  Why didn't he hit the ball?"  This happens
three more times, with Paddy wondering more each time.

After the fourth time, the guy with the stick drops the stick
and strolls up the side.  Now Paddy stands up and shouts "RUN!
RUN LIKE HELL!"  and the guy sitting next to Paddy says that he
doesn't have to run.  So Paddy asks him why, and is told that
the batter has four balls.

So Paddy shouts instead, "WALK WITH PRIDE, MAN!  WALK WITH
PRIDE!"
