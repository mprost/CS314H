I work in a court reporting office; in addition to my normal computer-related 
duties, I also proofread deposition transcripts during busy times. 
<P>
I've built up a pretty long list of humorous things that occasionally occur; 
unintentional (or intentional) double-entendres, witnesses (and lawyers) not 
paying attention to what they're really saying, and so forth. 
<P>
Here are some of the better ones that I (and some others in the office) have 
run across. 
<P>
*** Names have been changed to protect all parties. *** 
<P>
<PRE>      Q     I hate to be nosy, but how old are you? 
      A     Forty-three.  That's okay.  You're nosy 
 enough.  You might as well put that in. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     Did she appear to be in any pain?  In 
 other words, just looking at her, did she look like 
 she was hurting? 
      A     She's so ugly it looks like she hurts 
 all the time. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
            ATTORNEY:  I object to that as being a 
      question impossible to answer; outside this 
      person's expertise; and I don't know what it 
      means. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
            DEF ATT:  I object to that as being an 
      improper question and this man cannot answer 
      the question. 
            PLTF ATT:  Go sit on it. 
<P>
                        * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     What happened in that accident? 
      A     I was going around the corner and it was 
 wet and rainy outside, and I kind of slid down an 
 embankment and went into some bushes. 
      Q     Were the police called out to that? 
      A     A state trooper came out.  And he gave me 
 a careless driving ticket because he told me he had 
 to give me a ticket.  I didn't fight it, because it 
 was my word against the bushes, I guess you could 
 say. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
            THE WITNESS:  The relevant question here 
      is-- 
            ATTORNEY 1:  Well, why don't you let 
      her ask a question? 
            ATTORNEY 2:  Let her ask-- 
            THE WITNESS:  I thought you did.  Okay. 
            ATTORNEY 3:  I thought I did, too. 
            ATTORNEY 1:  Well, I don't know what it is. 
            ATTORNEY 3:  The witness does, and I do. 
            THE WITNESS:  What's your question? 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     Dr. Smith, how are you-- 
      A     Just fine. 
      Q     Pardon? 
      A     Just fine.  I'm ready to go. 
      Q     Okay.  Great.  How are you employed? 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      A     You've got to figure I'm a pretty 
 conservative lady.  This is the first concert I had 
 ever been to. 
      Q     Of any kind? 
      A     Well, I take that back.  I went to Jerry 
 Lee Lewis when I was 16 years old. 
      Q     There was no shooting at that concert, 
 was there? 
      A     No.  A whole lot of shaking going on, but 
 no shooting. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     What was your attorney's name? 
      A     It was John Smith, right here in Tampa. 
            LAWYER 1:  Right out the window. 
            THE WITNESS:  Right.  So what I'm 
      getting-- 
            LAWYER 2:  Let the record be clear that 
      Mr. Smith is not hanging out the window. 
            THE WITNESS:  I don't know.  Knowing 
      John, he could be. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     Is that the only license you hold? 
      A     I have a marriage license. 
      Q     You're not a realtor or a plumber or 
 anything else like that? 
      A     No.  They don't require a license to have 
 children, which they should. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      A     Well, I have never heard of anything like 
 that, but I suppose any help at the time would have 
 been a help. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
     Q     And the serratus anterior nerve that-- 
or the nerves that go to it, where do they come 
from? 
     A     The neck, the cervical region. 
     Q     From the cervical region? 
     A     Yes. 
     Q     And did you do any examination of his 
cervical--of his cervix--to determine if there 
was any problem with his nerves going through his 
neck? 
     A     He doesn't have a cervix, but, yes, I 
examined the biceps. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     How long have you been married to her? 
      A     Nineteen years. 
      Q     Is that your only marriage? 
      A     Yes, it is, that I know of. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     Do you recall discussing with John 
 Smith that if you were in a deposition or 
 anything like that and you don't want to give the 
 right answer, all you have to say is, "I don't know. 
 I don't recall"? 
      A     No.  I don't remember. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
     Q     No one went with you from Foobar to assist 
you.  Correct? 
     A     It seems to me--not from Foobar.  Like I 
said, it was a long time ago.  I mean, my memory is as 
short as my peter. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      A     Obsessive-compulsive symptoms:  Sometimes 
 checks his own activities.  Suicidal and homicidal 
 ideations:  Sometimes he has suicidal ideations 
 regarding his car or truck every couple of days, 
 particularly following contact with his attorney. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     Do you recall if you had any alcohol or 
 anything to drink prior to the concert? 
      A     Yes, I did. 
      Q     What did you have, if you remember? 
      A     I think I had a Fuzzy Navel. 
      Q     You ought to have a doctor look at that. 
 Just kidding. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     Do you consider him to be competent in 
 that area? 
      A     I don't know.  I don't have any basis to 
 remark about the competency of his engineering.  I 
 do know he's dead. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      A     There are very few production places in 
 North Dakota. 
            ATTORNEY:  Generally speaking, there 
      are very few places in North Dakota. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     And where does sandblasting fit in your 
 scale of being a prestigious job?  Do you think 
 that's a prestigious job? 
      A     Yes, sir. 
      Q     Okay.  More so than working in a 
 factory, I guess. 
      A     Yes, sir. 
      Q     Everybody's entitled to their opinion, I 
 guess.  I don't know.  Maybe you're right. 
            MR. JONES:  Ranks above lawyers. 
            MR. SMITH:  Yeah, I bet. 
            MR. JONES:  Because everybody does 
      that. 
            MR. SMITH:  Yeah. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
            MR. SMITH:  If I could just have a 
      one-minute break sometime, whenever you feel 
      you're-- 
            MR. JONES:  This is a good time. 
            (Recess from 2:41 p.m. to 3:03 p.m.) 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
     Q     Do you have any reason to believe that 
 the decision to have Mr. Jones, Mr. Brown and 
 yourself work on Foobar products to the exclusion 
 of the EMS products listed in group 3 and 4 of 
 Exhibit--of the December 5 chart was made or-- 
           MR. SMITH:  Can you read that back, and 
     maybe I can try and figure out what I wanted to 
     ask. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     Oh, okay.  So you had a conversation with 
 Mr. Smith about the SeaTower at some point-- 
      A     Yes. 
      Q    --prior to his death? 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
     Q    And what is it about that particular night that you 
recall that you didn't eat at the Holiday Inn? 
     A    What is it that I remember that I didn't eat? 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
     Q    What was Linda drinking, if anything? 
     A    She was drinking one of them--one of them lady drinks. 
I don't know what it was. 
     Q    She had about the same as you? 
     A    No.  Huh-uh.  She doesn't drink much.  She'll just have 
one drink, and she'll suck on it all night long. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
     Q     Next time you saw him? 
     A     August 12, 1991.  Checked tonsils--no, 
I'm sorry, checked testicle.  Must be mother asking. 
But I didn't find anything wrong with testicle.  On 
the contrary, I noticed there was an ear problem. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
     Q    And Detroit Murphy--what is that?  Is that a school 
or-- 
     A    It's Mercy, not Murphy. 
     Q    Oh, Mercy? 
     A    I'm sorry.  Yeah, Mercy. 
     Q    Oh, I'm sorry.  Mercy. 
     A    Yeah, Detroit Mercy is a college, and they do it like 
through the Jesuit priests program.  They do things with young 
boys. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
           MR. SMITH:  Let me ask you, sir, 
     to identify what I am going to have marked as 
     Defendant's Exhibit No. 1. 
           MR. JONES:  Okay. 
           (Exhibit No. 1 marked for identification.) 
     A     He has nice big ones. 
           MR. JONES:  I have got the same ones, 
     and I had them blown. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     Could you please, in your own words, 
 describe where you're touching on your body? 
      A     Right here. 
      Q     All right.  Now, where is "right here"? 
      A     Right here. 
      Q     Is that your leg? 
      A     No, sir.  My leg is here.  That's my 
 stomach.  I got two stomachs right here.  But he was-- 
      Q     All right.  You have two stomachs. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     Why do you handle the family finances? 
      A     Because my mom and sister ain't that 
 bright. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
     Q     Did you notice any differences in the plaintiff 
during the fishing trip after the accident and the 
times you had been with him before? 
     A     Yes. 
     Q     Can you tell the jury about that? 
     A     After a long period of time holding his 
rod, you could see he had to sit down for a period 
of time. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     How far apart are the rungs on the 
 ladder? 
      A     They're usually about 12 inches to a 
 foot. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     What did you do for Johnson &amp; Sons Formal 
 Wear? 
      A     I was a presser. 
      Q     Who was your boss there? 
      A     I forget his name.  He's the owner. 
            MR. SMITH:  Johnson. 
      A     Yeah.  It's a father-and-son operation. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     You don't have any intention of 
 dismissing Jane Smith anytime soon, do you? 
      A     No.  Sometimes I wish I could eat her, 
 and other times you want to hug her up and kiss her 
 nose. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      A     Mr. Jones and I had had a 
 disagreement, the exact nature of which I don't 
 remember, but it was over some aspect of my work 
 that he wanted me to perform in a manner different 
 than, I guess, I was performing it.  And Mr. 
 Jones's--excuse my language coming up--Mr. 
 Jones said, "If you fuck with me, I'll kill 
 you." 
      Q     When he said, "If you fuck with me, I'll 
 kill you," how did you interpret that? 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     Has anybody else ever threatened to kill 
 you? 
      A     No.  Somebody put a gun to my neck once, 
 but I don't think he threatened to use it. 
      Q     Was that in an employment contact or not? 
      A     No.  It was a social contact. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     Is there a difference between a 
 reconditioned and rebuilt piece of equipment in your 
 mind, if you have one? 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     So the first thing that you heard was the 
 one that you overheard with Mr. Jones stating that 
 he didn't want any women in his department.  And 
 then second time when you were in this exact 
 conversation would have been after the first time? 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     Have you tried any type of rehabilitation 
 or work retraining? 
      A     No.  No, sir. 
      Q     Why not? 
      A     Because I ain't too bright. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     And, Doctor, are you a member of the 
 profession?  Correct? 
      A     What profession? 
      Q     The medical profession. 
      A     Oh, yes, sir. 
      Q     And what profession are you a member of? 
      A     The medical profession. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     I would like you to turn to the next 
 page, dated June 9, 1993. 
      A     Yes. 
      Q     Do you recall this incident occurring? 
      A     Yes.  The night before that I had eaten 
 at Beachcomber's Restaurant.  And I had crab.  And I 
 had vomited in the-- 
      Q     I assure you on this question a simple 
 "Yes" or "No" will do. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
     Q    Anything else you like to do a lot? 
     A    Look out the window. 
     Q    Have you got a good view? 
     A    No. 
     Q    You just like to look out there? 
     A    Yeah. 
     Q    What can you see from your window? 
     A    The apartments in front of us. 
     Q    I guess there's usually a lot of activity out there. 
     A    Not no more. 
     Q    How come? 
     A    The drug dealer moved away. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     Okay.  Did it become a shouting match at 
 any time? 
      A     Uh-huh. 
      Q     It did? 
      A     A big one. 
      Q     And what was the net result? 
      A     I left, was the result.  I left.  I 
 basically told him that I didn't care how big his 
 dick was. 
      Q     How did that comment come up? 
      A     It just came out. 
      Q     Okay.  Why did you make that comment? 
 Does he talk about, you know, his penis a lot? 
      A     Yeah, he always talks about his penis. 
 He thinks it's the greatest thing that ever walked 
 on earth. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
      Q     And what was the reason given to you for 
 the fact you were let go? 
      A     The reason given to me was garnishing a 
 knife and arguing with the supervisor. 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
     Q     Is the south boundary of the north half 
of the southeast quarter of the northwest quarter 
the same line as the north boundary of the south 
half of the southeast quarter of the northwest 
quarter? 
<P>
                         * * * * * * * * 
<P>
     Q     Do you currently have normal bowel 
movements? 
     A     No. 
     Q     In what way have they changed? 
     A     I have a lot more gas that I--I fart a 
lot more; and when I do, they're much stronger than 
the normal person. 
           Isn't that true, Jane? 
           I know it's not funny, but it's true.
