The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply.
Your question was:

&gt; help i'm a bug

And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

} &lt;poof&gt; you're a feature!

The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply.
Your question was:

&gt; (cross-posted to rec.guns)
&gt;
&gt; What is the season, out-of-state license fee, and bag limit on ex-wives
&gt; in the state of New Hampshire?

And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

} First, you have to say the magic words.
}
} "Uh, abracadabra?"
}
} No, try again.
}
} "Oh, I know.  Please?"
}
} No, but you're getting closer.  Try again.
}
} "Great Oracle, please answer the question of this lowly mortal who is
}  not worthy to sniff your shoe trees."
}
} Now you got it.  I shall answer.
}
} The traditional season is late fall, after the leaves have fallen.  The
} lack of foliage makes them easier to spot.  License fees are usually
} minimal, and the limit is one ex-wife per day (although mormons are
} allowed up to three).
}
} Let us follow the brave hunter into the forest, to witness this
} exciting sport.
}
} He quietly creeps up to a tree, which looks out on a clearing.  He
} positions himself behind the tree, quiets his breathing, and gently
} pulls out the ex-wife call.  He blows into it and the sound of
} "alimony! alimony!" echos through the woods.  There!  What was that?  A
} rustling from the bushes a ways down.  He sees some sparkles of light
} and figures it may be another hunter, so he holds his fire.  But now
} the creature steps out of the cover and he can see that the sparkling
} is the diamonds given to the ungrateful bitch months before by her
} husband.  He aims and prepares to fire... but holds, as he sees she is
} not alone.  There are large, shambling forms accompanying her -
} lawyers!  It is not unexpected for an ex-wife in the wild to be
} surrounded by one or more of these parasites, but it is always a
} surprise to see them.  He aims again and fires!  Damn, hit a lawyer.
} That's ok though, it's always open season on lawyers and there's no
} limit.  But now the others are scattering.  <b>BLAM</b> He quickly fires
} again and this time hits the target!
}
} Now that he has killed the ex-wife what will he do with it?  Many men
} quickly stuff and mount their kills, but trust me stuffing and mounting
} is much more fun with a live woman.
}
} So there you have it.  You should keep in mind, of course, that similar
} fees and limits apply to the hunting of ex-husbands, so be sure to wear
} something bullet proof.
}
} You owe the Oracle 50% of your posessions, unless you remembered to
} draw up a pre-question agreement.

The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply.
Your question was:

&gt; Oh wise and noble oracle, king of heaven and earth,
&gt;
&gt;      Have you ever been compared to the Ouija board???

And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

} No, but indeed I used to DABBLE in them.
}
} Picture the scene . . .
}
} &gt;several yuppies and their SO's gathered in a stylish SoCal
}  living room, loft prominently decorated.  A half-empty bottle
}  of Martini and Rossi Asti Spumante is in evidence&lt;
}
} Y1: Oh, Mighty Ouija board, will my wife have a baby this year?
}
} The pointer trembles and starts a slow deliberate waltz around
} the board.
}
} BOARD:  A-N-T-I-C-H-R-I-S-T
}
} The onlookers sit back stunned.
}
} Y2: Oh, Might Ouija board, will I get married this year?
}
} Again the pointer begins its journey.
}
} BOARD: H-A-H-A-H-A-H-A-G-A-S-P-U-M-P-A-T-T-E-N-D-A-N-T
}
} One yuppette sits back in a huff.
}
} Y3: Oh, Might Ouija board, how will my business trip go?
}
} The pointer again trembles and traces out the letters --
}
} BOARD: M-I-D-N-I-G-H-T-E-X-P-R-E-S-S
}
} It is now Yuppie 4's turn.  She regards the board with a
} jaundiced eye, tossing her luxuriant chestnut hair over
} one shoulder provocatively.  Her long, nimble fingers lay
} atop the pointer.  She is dressed stylishly, and tastefully.
} The lines of a picture-perfect figure are not hidden by her
} slim turtleneck, and were she not sitting on her well-rounded
} derriere, the two male participants would long ago have
} suffered cardiac infarction.
}
} Y4: Oh, Mighty Ouija board (her rich contralto intones) who will
}     my next serious relationship be with?
}
} The pointer shakes violently for several moments and begins to
} vibrate back and forth.
}
} BOARD: Z-E-U-S
}
} Then:
}
} BOARD: N-O-O-R-A-C-L-E
}
} Then:
}
} BOARD: I-S-A-I-D-Z-E-U-S
}
} Then:
}
} BOARD: O-R-A-C-L-E-D-A-M-N-I-T
}
} Then:
}
} BOARD:
} Y-O-U-W-O-U-L-D-N-T-E-V-E-N-K-N-O-W-W-H-A-T-T-O-D-O-W-I-T-H-H-E-R
}
} Then:
}
} BOARD: O-H-W-O-U-L-D-N-T-I-R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R-W-H-A-T-L-I-S-A-S-A-I-D
}
} Then:
}
} BOARD:
} L-I-S-A-D-O-E-S-N-T-K-N-O-W-W-H-A-T-S-H-E-S-T-A-L-K-I-N-G-A-B-O-U-T
}
} Then:
}
} BOARD: I-S-A-I-D-S-H-E-S-M-I-N-E-Y-O-U-L-I-T-T-L-E-G-I-T
}
} Then:
}
} BOARD: O-H-Y-E-A-H
}
} Then:
}
} BOARD: Y-E-A-H
}
} Then:
}
} BOARD: O-H-Y-E-A-H
}
} Then:
}
} BOARD: Y-E-A-H
}
} Then:
}
} BOARD: O-H-Y-E-A-H
}
} Upon which point the yuppies all get sick of the bickering and throw
} the board out, where a little girl names Regan who lives down the
} street picks it out of the trash and brings it home.  One male yuppie
} does suffer a fatal heart attack upon the brunette woman's rising, and
} the other severe palpitations.
}
} You owe the Oracle the brunette's phone number.  &gt;Shut up, Zeus.&lt;

The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply.
Your question was:

&gt; Oh really swell Oracle, could you
&gt; please tell me
&gt;                                       What's this crap?
&gt; What?

&gt;
&gt; Oh really swell Oracle, could you

&gt;                                       think of his own question!
&gt; Ok, how about this:
&gt; can you please tell me what's best to
&gt; do for multiple personality disorder?
&gt;                                       What?!  No! -- ha, ha Mr.

The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply.
Your question was:

&gt; Will I have a girlfriend anytime soon, and will she be someone I know?
&gt; If not, what will she be like?

And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

} [Tons of confetti, balloons and fanfare music appear in the background]
}
} CONGRATULATIONS!  You are the ONE MILLIONTH sentient being to ask the
} Oracle this question!  You've won an instant trip to
} iuvax.cs.indiana.edu!
}
} [The Oracle gestures, and the dazed supplicant appears.]
}
} Supplicant:
} WOW!  Thanks, Oracle, but what about my question?
}
} Oracle:
} That's the best part!  You've also won ONE HOUR -- yes, one FULL hour
} alone with Lisa in a locked room!
}
} -- [The spotlights focus on a steel door, which opens to reveal Lisa
} dressed in a see through leopard-skin teddy, carrying a whip.]
}
} Supplicant:
} Uh...
}
} Oracle:
} Congratulations, you lucky mortal!  In ya go!
}
} Supplicant:
} Hey, WAIT a minute!  [WHIP!]  OW!  Stop that!  I didn't -- HELP!
} SOMEBODY!
}
} Oracle:
} We'll be back in an hour to check on his progress.  Meanwhile, the
} 999,998th person to ask "What's going to be on the CS midterm?" is
} calling in now...

The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply.
Your question was:

&gt; Oh most awesome Oracle,
&gt;
&gt; What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
&gt; What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
&gt; What shall we do with a drunked sailor,
&gt; Early in the morning?

And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

} Keep him away from the oil tanker,
} Don't let him near the oil tanker
} Don't let him steer the oil tanker
} Early in the morning!
}
} You owe the Oracle a can of salmon that doesn't taste like crude oil.

The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply.
Your question was:

&gt; I accidentally deleted a Most Important Project from the disk, and I
&gt; don't have a backup.  My boss is expecting a (now deleted) project
&gt; soon.  What should I do?

And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

} First, clear your mind of the illusion that it was you who deleted the
} project. It was Dharma. He deleted the project as a test to see whether
} you are ready to undertake your destiny.
}
} When your boss next asks you when the project will be completed, tell
} him or her, "It is complete."
}
} BOSS: "Oh? When did you finish it?"
}
} YOU: "It is not yet finished."
}
} BOSS: "Well, when can you get it to me?"
}
} YOU: "You already have it."
}
} BOSS: "I do? Where is it?"
}
} YOU: "It is inside you."
}
} BOSS: "What?"
}
} YOU: "The report is a part of you, and of me. We are a part of the
}       Universal All. When we are finished, All shall be finished."
}
} BOSS: "The Universal All?"
}
} YOU: "The beginning is the end. Hesitate. Be lost. Consider the lotus."
}
} BOSS: "Lotus..."
}
} YOU: "Om."
}
} BOSS: "Om."
}
} If you get the conversation to this stage, Dharma will be very
} satisfied with you. As you can tell, it is your destiny to get
} your butt canned in the near future.
}
} You owe the Oracle a backup of your latest project.
