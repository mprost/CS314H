<PRE>Here are some George Bush Quotes I have collected-  Enjoy!
Many are from Doonesbury, and the New Republic.

"I think there were some differences, there's no question, and will
still be. We're talking about a major, major situation here that
requires constant work.  But it was well worth it and there's much
more to it than just this- I mean just these sixteen accomplishments
or whatever: I mean, we've got a major rapport- relationship of
economics, major in the security, and all of that, we should not lose
sight of."
	--1/10/92 to reporters, on his trip to Japan

"Please don't look at the part of the glass that is only half full."
	--11/6/91

"No you're not going to see me stay put... I am not going to forsake
my responsibilities. You may not see me put as much- I mean, un-put
as much"
	--11/8/91

"You cannot be president of the United States of you don't have faith.
Remember Lincoln, going to his knees in times of trial and the Civil
War and all that stuff. You can't be. And we are blessed. So don't
feel sorry for- don't cry for me, Argentina."
	--1/15/92


"I think I've got to do better in making clear what the message is, and I think
I can do better. But I think there's so much noise out there that I've got to
figure out how to make it clearer that we are for the things that I have advocated
that would help."
	-2/18/91

"Your dedication and tireless work with the hostage thing, with
Central America, really give me cause for great pride in you and
thanks. Get some turkey, George Bush."  
-- Vice President George Bush in a written expression of gratitude to
Oliver North, circa Thanksgiving 1985. Read by North during his
interview with Ted Koppel on "Nightline," 10/22/91


"I don't want to just sit here blaming Congress. I mean, we're all
in this together." --President Bush, 11/20/91 to news anchor Bill
Stuart of KCNC-TV, Denver.
"I think the Congress should be blamed." --several minutes later,
to Warner Saunders of WMAQ-TV, Chicago.

"If a frog had wings, he wouldn't hit his tail on the ground. 'If.'
 Too hypothetical."



"And let me say in conclusion, thanks for the kids.  I learned an awful lot
about bathtub toys-- about how to work the telephone. One guy knows- several
of them know their own phone numbers- preparation to go to the dentist. A lot
of things I'd forgotten. So it's been a good day." - January 21, at a
Head Start center in Catonsville, Maryland




"The guy over there at Pease - a woman actually - she said something about a
 country-western song about the train, a light at the end of the tunnel...
 I only hope it's not a train coming the other way. Well, I said to her, well,
 I'm a country music fan. I love it, always have. Doesn't fit the mold of some
 of the columnists, I might add, but nevertheless - of what they think I ought
 to fit in, but I love it.  You should have been with me at the c.m.a. awards
 at Nashville. But nevertheless, I said to them there's another one that the
 Nitty Ditty Nitty Gritty Great Bird - and it says if you want to see a rainbow
 you've got to stand a little rain. We've had a little rain. New Hampshire
 has had too much rain."

"And so I do understand New Hampshire because I have this wonderfully warm
 feeling that New Hampshire feels exactly the way we do on these questions of
 family values and faith.  Somebody said to me, we prayed for you over there. 
 That was not just because I threw up on the Prime Minister of Japan, either.
 Where was he when I needed him? I said, let me tell you something. And I say 
 this - I don't know whether any ministers from the episcopal church are here -
 I hope so. But I said to him this: You're on to something here.  You cannot
 be President of the United States if you don't have faith.  It's been great.
 I'll go back to Washington all fired up for tomorrow and tackle the President
 or the Prime Minister of this or the Governor of that coming in. But I'll
 have this heartbeat..."




"You're burning up time.  The meter is running through the sand on you and
I am now fillibustering."


"I see this glass not half-empty, but half-full and more."


"Ours is a great state, and we don't like limits of any kind. Ricky Clunn is
one of the great bass fishermen. He's a Texas young guy, and he's a very 
competitive fisherman, and he talked about learning to fish wading in the
creeks behind his dad. He in his underwear went wading in the creeks behind
his father, and he said--as a fisherman he said it's great to grow up in a
country with no limits..."

"Somebody--somebody asked me, what's it take to win? I said to them, I can't
remember, what does it take to win the Super Bowl? Or maybe Steinbrenner,
my friend George, will tell us what it takes for the Yanks to win--one run.
But I went over to the Strawberry Festival this morning, and ate a piece of
shortcake over there--able to enjoy it right away, and once I completed it,
it didn't have to be approved by Congress--I just went ahead and ate it--
and that leads me into what I want to talk to you about today..."
-March 4, at a fund-raising lunch in Tampa, Florida
