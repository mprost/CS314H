Recently one of my friends, a computer wizard, payed me a visit. 
As we were talking I mentioned that I had recently installed
Windows 95 on my PC, I told him how happy I was with this operating
system and showed him the Windows 95 CD. Too my surprise he threw 
it into my micro-wave oven and turned on the oven. Instantly I got 
very upset, because the CD had become precious to me, but he said:
'Do not worry, it is unharmed.' After a few minutes he took the CD 
out, gave it to me and said: 'Take a close look at it.' To my 
surprise the CD was quite cold to hold and it seemed to be heavier 
than before. At first I could not see anything, but on the inner 
edge of the central hole I saw a inscription, an inscription finer 
than anything I have ever seen before. The inscription shone 
piercingly bright, and yet remote, as if out of a great depth:

'I cannot understand the fiery letters,' I said. 
'No but I can,' he said. 'The letters are Hex, of an ancient mode, 
but the language is that of Microsoft, which I shall not utter
here. But in common English this is what it says:'

       One OS to rule them all, One OS to find them,
       One OS to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
