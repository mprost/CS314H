<PRE>[
  this was from last week's sermon.  the original apparently comes
  from Charles Swindoll
]

There were two evil brothers.  They were rich, and used their money
to keep their ways from the public eye.  They even attended the same
church, and looked to be perfect Christians.

Then, their pastor retired, and a new one was hired.  Not only could
he see right through the brothers' deception, but he also spoke well
and true and the church started to swell in numbers.  A fund-raising
campaign was started to build a new assembly.

All of a sudden, one of the brothers died.  The remaining brother
sought out the new pastor the day before the funeral and handed him
a cheque for the amount needed to finish paying for the new building.
"I have only one condition," he said.  "At his funeral, you must say
my brother was a saint."  The pastor gave his word, and deposited
the cheque.

The next day, at the funeral, the pastor did not hold back.  "He was
an evil man," he said.  "He cheated on his wife and abused his family."
After going on in this vein for a small time, he concluded with,

"But compared to his brother, he was a saint."
