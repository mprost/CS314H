Just thought I'd pass this along...

Several years ago, while working in my shop, I had a customer in my chair that
I was just finishing up. ( Haircut)

As was my usual custom, I started to apply some after-shave lotion to the area
around the the ears that I had just shaved.

Customer: "Don't put that S#@! on me, my wife says I smell like a French  
Whore  House with that S#@!"

Another Customer in the Shop:  " Hey John, you can put it on me.  My wife has
never been in a French Whore House..."
