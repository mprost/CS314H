From the 1/26/96 editorial page of the Manchester Union Leader,
with credits to the Western Journalism Center:

	In the New Mexico Legislature's 1995 session, Sen. 
	Duncan Scott, a Republican from Albuquerque, proposed an amendment
	to a psychologist regulatory bill offered by another senator.
	The Scott amendment would have dramatically changed the face
	of New Mexico's legal system:

	The amendment said: ``When a psychologist or psychiatrist testifies
	during a defendant's competentcy hearing, the psychologist or
	psychiatrist shall wear a cone-shaped hat that is not less than
	two feet tall.  The surface of the hat shall be imprinted
	with stars and lightning bolts.

	``Additionally, a psychologist or psychiatrist shall be required
	to don a white beard that is not less than 18 inches in length,
	and shall punctuate crucial elements of his testimony by
	stabbing the air with a wand.  Whenever a psychologist or
	psychiatrist provides expert testimony regarding a defendant's 
	competentcy, the baliff shall contemporaneously dim the 
	courtroom lights and administer two strikes to a Chinese gong.''

	The bill, with the wizard amendment, passed the Senate by
	voice vote and cleared the House 46-14.  Unfortunately,
	Gov. Gary Johnson vetoed the legislation.
