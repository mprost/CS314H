<PRE>Here is a set of samplings from the one-liner file.  When processing
submissions, if I see a short joke that is good but doesn't quite merit
a posting of its own, I put it in the one-liner file.  I haven't
posted the results for quite some time, so some of these are pretty old.
I have split the file up into 10 chunks of around 300 lines each.  Some
newsreaders go crazy and try to "undigestify" this -- beware.

Subject: occult, black humor (original)

I've started an apocrophal story about the validity of palm reading:

A friend of a friend was horrified to find out, at the age of twenty-five,
that his life line was extremely short.  When he tried to lengthen it (with
his trusty Victorinox) he bled to death.

&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt;  You know you lead a sad life when a nymphomaniac comes up to you and
&gt;&gt;  says,"Let's just be friends."

You know you lead a sad life when the girls who get around never get
around to you.

I replied, "I had my eggs over easy this morning too.  Lock me up
before I start tearing off mattress tags!"

One claim for the value of the British monarchy is that its existence precludes anyone from aspiring to absolute rule.  I have a theory that the American presidency serves a similar purpose, precluding anyone from managing the government.
