<PRE>Here is a set of samplings from the one-liner file.  When processing
submissions, if I see a short joke that is good but doesn't quite merit
a posting of its own, I put it in the one-liner file.  I haven't
posted the results for quite some time, so some of these are pretty old.
I have split the file up into 10 chunks of around 300 lines each.  Some
newsreaders go crazy and try to "undigestify" this -- beware.

the story ...

A friend was trying to describe some of the "facts of life" to his 15 year
old son...

	"It's a fact of life...  Males are born with 2 heads, but only enough
	blood to operate one at a time!"

Heard on the BBC's "Have I got News for You" programme...

It seems prostitutes have already moved into the hotels at the new

Subject: office one-liner, definition of stress

Some office one-liners from various anonymous sources collected over
the past 5 years or so.
*********************************************************************

No problem is so formidable that you can't just walk away from it.

To err is human, to forgive is against company policy.

If you have nothing to do, don't do it here.

If it works, don't fix it!

If I want your opinion, I'll ask you to fill out the necessary form.

People with narrow mind usually have broad tongues.

While money can't buy happiness, it certainly lets you choose your own
form of misery.

All work and no play, will may you a manager.

Crime wouldn't pay if the government ran it!

I like your approach, now let's see your departure.

Definition of Stress:
      That confusion that results when the mind overrides the body's
      desire to choke the living shit out of some asshole who
      desperately needs it.

Subject: golfing

If you are ever caught in a thunderstorm while playing golf, the best way
to keep from being struck by lightening is to pull out a 9-iron and hold it
