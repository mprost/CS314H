<PRE>Here is a set of samplings from the one-liner file.  When processing
submissions, if I see a short joke that is good but doesn't quite merit
a posting of its own, I put it in the one-liner file.  I haven't
posted the results for quite some time, so some of these are pretty old.
I have split the file up into 10 chunks of around 300 lines each.  Some
newsreaders go crazy and try to "undigestify" this -- beware.

I was surprised to learn that many computer virus programs have

what could the concept of copyright possibly *mean*?

I just went to a seminar on the chemistry of stratospheric ozone
and came up with us (has anyone else noticed?)

The acronym formed by the first letters of the phrase
"GLOBAL OZONE DEPLETION"
is

GOD.

I don't know about you, but I'm worried.

(Submitted by me for Mark Jansen, who thought it up, but probably
wouldn't submit it himself.  Oh, and please don't include this
parenthetical attribution with the joke if you accept the joke).

I am generally skeptical of the "PC Multicultural Conspiracy" charge, but

It has been determined that most teenage girls lose their virginity

Subject: Radio funnies

Heard this one on the radio this morning (from Jeff Greenleaf (?)):

The next time you get a speeding ticket and have nothing to do for the
next ten days or so, try this:

When the officer asks for your drivers license, registration and
proof of insurance, give it to him, but look at him funny.  When he
comes back, say, "There's nothing <i>in</i> the trunk."

Subject: MLK Holiday Weather

This is original. At least, I haven't heard anyone telling it but me.

Atlanta had a couple inches of snow on the ground for the federal holiday on
January 20. Now, snow is a wonderful thing for holidays like Christmas, but
there's just something not right about a white MLK's Birthday.
