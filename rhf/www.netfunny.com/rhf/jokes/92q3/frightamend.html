                          Amendment 1
Congress shall make laws compelling the establishment of religion
and demanding the exercise thereof; and abridging the freedom of
speech and of the liberal press; and preventing the people from
peaceful assembly; and forbidding the courts to redress
grievances.

                          Amendment 2

                          Amendment 3
No soldier shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house,
without the consent of the owner, unless that house is being used
for the distribution of illegal substances.

                          Amendment 4
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
papers. and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures,
shall be violated under the excuse of being for the public good,
and no warrants shall need to be issued, but upon probable cause
supported by anonymous sources, any place shall be subject to
search and persons or things seized.

                          Amendment 5
Any person who refuses to testify in court about his involvement
in a crime, shall automatically be judged guilty.  His property
may be seized upon the governments determination that he must be
guilty.

                          Amendment 6
In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right
to a speedy and public trial before he is found guilty.  He is
entitled to the assistance of counsel for his defense but not for
any appeals.

                          Amendment 7
In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall
exceed twenty million dollars, the right of trial by jury shall
be preserved.

                          Amendment 8
Excessive bail shall be required to ensure that the accused are
kept behind bars where they belong.

                          Amendment 9
The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall be
ignored if they conflict with the Walton's version of Family
Values.

                          Amendment 10
The powers not delegated to the United States by the
Constitution, shall be reserved for the Supreme Court, except
that the States shall have the right to ban abortions.
