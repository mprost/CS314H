	   Olympic BasketBall Dream Team Drinking Game '92
			    Version 1.0
		             (C) 1992
			    Chuck Hellier

Tune in the TripleCast Blue channel to watch USA crush yet another
3rd rate team that even Slippery Rock could beat.  Although the Dream
Team's plays will be exciting, follow the rules of this game to
complete the experience.

Collect all 10 McDonald's Dream Team Cups.  Distribute cups to
Drinking Game players.  Assume the identity of the Dream Team player
on your cup.  Fill your cup as follows:
	Magic Johnson		Margarita
	Patrick Ewing		Long Island Ice Tea
	Larry Bird		Sam Adams
	Karl Malone		Kamikaze
	Michael Jordan		Gatorade 'n' Vodka
	Charles Barkley		Coors Lite
	Chris Mullin		Gin 'n' Tonic
	John Stockton		Sierra Nevada Pale Ale
	Scotty Pippen		Coke 'n' Rum
	David Robinson		Fuzzy Navel
Get two bottles for the players who don't have McD's cups:
	Christian Laetner 	Miller Genuine Draft
	Clyde Drexler		Heineken

If the other team makes a free throw, everybody BOO.
If the other team makes a 2 pointer, everbody yell "Aaarrggghh."
If the other team makes a 3 pointer, everybody say "Aw, shit."
If the other team misses, everybody yell, "Yay!"

If your player makes a free throw, everyone else take a sip.
If your player makes a 2 pointer, everyone else drink.
If your player makes a 3 pointer, everyone else take a big gulp.
If your player misses, take two drinks.
If your player fouls, take 3 drinks.

If your player grandstands, drink.

If Barkley disses somebody, whoever is "Barkley" has to drink.

If Magic assists somebody, that person has to drink.

If Larry falls, "Larry" has to drink.

If Chick makes a Chick-ism, everybody drink.  If it's new (i.e. not
Mustard or popcorn machine), drink twice.

If someone mentions how International rules differ from NBA rules,
everyone yell "NBA Rules!" and the last person to do so has to drink.

If someone mispronounces a foreigner's name, call out the proper
pronunciation.  Everyone else drink.

If you see the Barcelona Cat, yell "I hate that stupid cat!."  The last
person to do so has to drink.

If the buzzer (that sounds like the 1st note in the Olympic Theme)
sounds, everyone hum the next 5 notes.

If someone talks about the rumor that Magic will come back to the
NBA, "Magic" has to drink.

If someone says that the other team is only concerned with getting
the autographs of the Dream Team, drink.

If they show a shot of John Stockton on the bench, "Stockton" has to
drink.

If the message "If you are watching this, you are authorized to watch
this..." comes on, throw your drink at the TV.
