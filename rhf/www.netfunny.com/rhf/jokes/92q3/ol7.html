<PRE>Here is a set of samplings from the one-liner file.  When processing
submissions, if I see a short joke that is good but doesn't quite merit
a posting of its own, I put it in the one-liner file.  I haven't
posted the results for quite some time, so some of these are pretty old.
I have split the file up into 10 chunks of around 300 lines each.  Some
newsreaders go crazy and try to "undigestify" this -- beware.

Subject: Be careful where you put that 'L'!


It's interesting what happens when you ... accidentally add an 'L' at
the beginning of various words.  You get such things as:

  luser
  LUSENET
  LUSENIX
  lintegrated circuit
  LI-B-M
  LUNIX
  lusage

(If you think of any more, please email them to me.)

This morning a potential joke hit me.   

What is the opposite of SO, significant other?
Answer:  I/O.

As when you are on a date and your companion mentions his or her SO.
That makes you an I/O.   (Bad news.)

Paraphrased from Alan Fotheringham's column in Maclean's last week:

Everyone knows the old saw about "If you owe the bank $10 thousand you're
in trouble;  if you owe the bank $10 million, the bank is in trouble."
Well, if you owe the bank $15 billion, the taxpayers are in trouble.

Modern Coke Machines are microprocessor-controlled, and many even

boxes fill or they run out of supplies or they're broken into. These
modems are vulnerable to attack by a class of computer hackers known
in the industry as ``Soda Crackers.''

where a rep from Horizon Entertainment comes on to demonstrate their new
Virtual Reality game:

	"So, let me get this straight. Eventually Virtual Reality could get
good enough that some guy from New Jersey could come home from work, rent
a cartridge for $19.95, and have sex with Elle Macpherson. This could make
crack look like Sanka!"
