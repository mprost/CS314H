<PRE>Here is a set of samplings from the one-liner file.  When processing
submissions, if I see a short joke that is good but doesn't quite merit
a posting of its own, I put it in the one-liner file.  I haven't
posted the results for quite some time, so some of these are pretty old.
I have split the file up into 10 chunks of around 300 lines each.  Some
newsreaders go crazy and try to "undigestify" this -- beware.

Subject: Bush's legacy from Reagan


I realized this morning why Reagan and Bush were such a good combination.
We called Reagan the Teflon President.  Given the way Bush continually
changes his mind on the issues based on current political pressures,
he must be the Waffle President.
