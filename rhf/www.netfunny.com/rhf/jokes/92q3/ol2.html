<PRE>Here is a set of samplings from the one-liner file.  When processing
submissions, if I see a short joke that is good but doesn't quite merit
a posting of its own, I put it in the one-liner file.  I haven't
posted the results for quite some time, so some of these are pretty old.
I have split the file up into 10 chunks of around 300 lines each.  Some
newsreaders go crazy and try to "undigestify" this -- beware.

My sister told me this one a long time ago.

Sex, Religion and Mystery.  One student allegedly handed in the following
story:

"My god!" cried the duchess.  "I'm pregnant.  Who did it?"
