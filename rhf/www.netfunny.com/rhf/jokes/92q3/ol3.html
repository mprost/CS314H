<PRE>Here is a set of samplings from the one-liner file.  When processing
submissions, if I see a short joke that is good but doesn't quite merit
a posting of its own, I put it in the one-liner file.  I haven't
posted the results for quite some time, so some of these are pretty old.
I have split the file up into 10 chunks of around 300 lines each.  Some
newsreaders go crazy and try to "undigestify" this -- beware.

This is third or fourth hand, so I cannot tell you the source.

It appears some British newspaper ran a contest to come up with a new
name for the USSR.

One of the better entries was UFFR: Union of Fewer and Fewer Republics.

I overheard one of the secretaries in the office saying:

God I love it here...  Why do I work here!?
        Because I'm too old for a paper route
        Too young for social security
        and too tired to have an affair...

Subject: Topical, USSR, original

With departure of Ukraine from the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev announced
that the official English name of the former Soviet Union has been changed to
Intersection of Soviet Socialist Republics, yet spelled USSR, but with an
inverted U.

This is original.

From: RICH@suhep.phy.syr.edu (Richard S. Holmes)

(Adapted from an editorial cartoon:)

This year's hottest Christmas gift was the Mario Cuomo doll.  You wind it up,
and it doesn't run.

Subject: Post holiday diet joke
From: kiisaka@csi.uottawa.ca (Ken Iisaka)

My friend, Duncan Bailey said:

People are so worried about what they eat between Christmas and the New Year,
but they really should be worried about what they eat between the New Year and
Christmas.

Subject: Pee Wee, Chuckle, Topical, original
From: salzberg@sunquakes.geol.binghamton.edu (David Salzberg)

As we enter the New Year, newspapers across the country are running 
lists of what is in and what is out for 1992.

In my local paper, the "in" column included Pee Wee Herman.

It is amazing what a little exposure wil do for some peoples career.

Subject: Bush illness
From: dbrooks@osf.org ( David Brooks, Open Software Foundation )

Original.

At a dinner in Japan yesterday, President Bush threw up and passed
out.  This was caused by a mixup in the kitchens; that plate had been
intended for Lee Iacocca.

Subject: Spring semester advice
From: denelsbe@cs.unc.edu (Kevin Denelsbeck)


This is courtesy of a friend and classmate, Charles Kurak.  I thought it
might be especially appropriate for those of us just beginning new semesters
of work:


	Don't keep a negative attitude, such as

		"I will not succeed, I will not succeed."

	Instead, keep a positive attitude:

		"I WILL fail.  I WILL fail."

From the Tulanian, the Tulane alumna magazine:

   Politicians are like bananas:
   They're green when you pick 'em,
   ant then they hang around in bunches and get rotten.

Subject: New Ahnuld Movie

     This IS an original, by the bye...

     Apparently Arnold Schwarzenegger's next movie is going to be about the 
lives of the world's great composers.  The movie has Steven Seagal set to play 
Beethoven, Jean-Claude Van Damme will be Mozart, and when Arnie got wind of the
project, he said...

     "I'll be Bach"

Subject: New Michael Jackson album



 Q:  Do you know why the new Michael Jackson album is called
     "Dangerous"?

 A:  Because the record company execs couldn't spell "Androgynous".

Subject: Grapes of Wrath Russian Style

During a hard period in Soviet history, the government showed _The_Grapes_Of_
<i>Wrath</i> to the citizens, in an effort to show how much worse the United States
was.

All the citizens saw was that even the poorest Americans owned cars.

Subject: New World Order

I found the following in talk.politics.soviet, posted by
conrad@tharr.UUCP (Conrad Longmore).  I'm assuming that his posting it
put it in the public domain.  I have paraphrased.
It seems an obvious joke, but I've not heard it before.

Question: What is the "New World Order"?

Answer: Simple. The "New World Order" is where the New World gives all
        the orders.

Subject: a suggestion to mapmakers


I just came back from Wal-mart. One of the gift items they had were these nice
globes of the earth. I noted that they had painted Germany as one country
already, but the Baltics, and of course, the Ukraine, were still painted as
part of USSR.

They really ought to sell those with this packet of stickers -- one for each
S.S.R., so that as they break off, you could paste them in.

As a followup to the joke:

One of my anarchist friends commented:
Abstinence is the only way to be 100% sure.

I hear Long Dong Silver is quite upset about his name being mentioned
in such a disreputable place as the United States Senate.

You've probably heard "brevity is the soul of wit,"
but have you heard "gravity is the soul of weight?"
