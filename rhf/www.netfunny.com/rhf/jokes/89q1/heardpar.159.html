This man had a parrot. This parrot knew only one sentence, 
which was "Let's make love." The parrot said it all the time, 
embarrassing the owner to no end. 
<P>
Finally, he went to his parish priest and told him of his parrot 
problem. The priest replied, "I have a parrot who also only knows 
one sentence. He always says, "Let us pray."  Bring your parrot over 
Sunday after mass, and I'm sure your parrot will be praying by the 
end of the day." 
<P>
So, as directed, The owner brought the parrot over to the rectory 
after mass. The parrot, spying the priest's parrot, opened his mouth 
and blurted out, "Let's make love." 
<P>
The priest's parrot closed his eyes, looked up at heaven and said, 
"My prayers have been answered." 
<P>
