April 1, 1988:   The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered 
by physicists at Turgid University.  The element, tentatively named 
Administratium (Ad), has no protons or electrons, which means that its atomic 
number is 0.  However, it does have 1 neutron, 125 assistants to the neutron, 
75 vice-neutrons, and 111 assistants to the vice-neutrons.  This gives it an 
atomic mass number of 312.  The 312 particles are held together in the nucleus 
by a force that involves the continuous exchange of meson-like particles called 
memoons. 
<P>
Since it has no electrons, Administratium is inert.  However, it can be 
detected chemically because it seems to impede every reaction in which it is 
present.  According to Dr. M. Langour, one of the discoverers of the element, a 
very small amount of Administratium made one reaction that normally takes less 
than a second take over four days. 
<P>
Administratium has a half-life of approximately 3 years, at which 
time it does not actually decay.  Instead, it undergoes a reorganization in 
which assistants to the neutron, vice-neutrons, and assistants to the 
vice-neutrons exchange places.  Some studies have indicated that the atomic 
mass number actually increases after each reorganization. 
<P>
Administratium was discovered by accident when Dr. Languor angrily 
resigned from the chairmanship of the physics department and dumped all of his 
papers into the intake hatch of the university's particle accelerator. 
"Apparently, the interaction of all of those reports, grant forms, etc. with 
the particles in the accelerator created the new element."  Dr. Langour 
explained. 
<P>
Research at other laboratories seems to indicate that Administratium 
might occur naturally in the atmosphere.  According to one scientist, 
Administratium is most likely to be found on college and university campuses, 
near the best-appointed and best-maintained buildings.
