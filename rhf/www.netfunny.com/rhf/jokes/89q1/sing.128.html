There was a little girl whose mother was very strict. Her mother tried to make 
her daughter behave in a very decent manner, but the girl was still three and 
half years old. One day the family went to a party, and in the middle of the 
party the girl cried, "Mommy I want to go restroom." This drew a lot of 
attention and the mother felt embarrassed about her daughter. At home she 
advised that whenever she wants to go to restroom she should say, "I want to 
sing." 
<P>
After a couple of days the girl's grandfather came to visit them. She liked 
her grandfather very much.   At night, she slept with her grandfather, who 
put her to sleep with a story.  After couple of hours, she woke up and 
said, "Grandpa I want to sing."  The grandpa was afraid of causing a 
disturbance past midnight if the girl began singing, so he told her in a very 
low voice, "Baby if you want to sing, sing in my ears."
