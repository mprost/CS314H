A new sales assistant was hired at a large dept. store.  On his first day, the 
sales manager took him around to show him the ropes.  They were passing by 
the gardening section, when they heard a customer asking for grass seed. 
The sales manager stepped in. 
<P>
SM: Excuse me, but will you be needing a hose to water your lawn? 
<P>
C : I guess so. I'll take one. 
<P>
SM: And how about some fertilizer and weed-killer ? 
<P>
C : Um, okay. 
<P>
SM: Here's a couple of bags. You'll also need a lawn mower to cut the grass 
when it starts growing too long. 
<P>
C : I'll take one of those too. 
<P>
After the customer left, the sales manager turned to the assistant. "You see?" 
he said, "that's the way to make a good sale.  Always sell more than what 
the customer originally came in for." 
<P>
Impressed, the assistant headed off for the pharmaceutical section, where 
he was to work.  Soon, a man strolled in. 
<P>
MAN: I'd like to buy a pack of Tampax, please. 
<P>
SA : Sure, and would you like to buy a lawn mower too? 
<P>
MAN: Why would I want to do that? 
<P>
SA : Well, your weekend's shot to hell anyway, so you might as well mow the 
lawn. 
<P>
