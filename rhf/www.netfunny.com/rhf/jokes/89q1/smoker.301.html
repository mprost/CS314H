The dew was still wet as the prisoner was let out into the yard for the last 
time.  The soldiers of the firing detail shuffled out to their usual 
positions as the guards led the prisoner to the stake at the far end of the 
paddock.  There, he was securely bound as the captain of the guards stepped 
forward to contend with the final courtesies. 
<P>
"Blindfold?" he inquired. 
<P>
"No, thank you," said the condemned. 
<P>
The captain was a little taken aback at the difficulty and leaned forward so 
as not to be heard. 
<P>
"Please," he said, "take the blindfold.  It is not an act of cowardice to be 
spared this spectacle.  It makes it MUCH easier for you." 
<P>
The condemned thought for a moment and relented.  The blindfold was tied 
over his eyes. 
<P>
"Cigarette?" offered the captain. 
<P>
"No thanks," said the prisoner, "I don't smoke." 
<P>
Here again the captain paused and thought of a tactful approach.  He leaned 
in and spoke in a confidential tone. 
<P>
"No matter.  Please take the cigarette.  It makes it MUCH easier for the men 
on the firing squad." 
<P>
(I don't think it needs to be stated that this might be offensive to smokers.)
