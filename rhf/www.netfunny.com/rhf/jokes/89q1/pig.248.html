(My friend Brad in NYC told me this one yesterday.) 
<P>
There was once a man from the city who was visiting a small farm, 
and during this visit he saw a farmer feeding pigs in a most 
extraordinary manner.  The farmer would lift a pig up to a nearby 
apple tree, and the pig would eat the apples off the tree 
directly.  The farmer would move the pig from one apple to 
another until the pig was satisfied, then he would start again 
with another pig. 
<P>
The city man watched this activity for some time with great 
astonishment.  Finally he could not resist saying to the farmer, 
"This is the most inefficient method of feeding pigs that I can 
imagine.  Just think of the time that would be saved if you 
simply shook the apples off the tree and let the pigs eat them 
from the ground!" 
<P>
The farmer looked puzzled and replied, "What's time to a pig?"
