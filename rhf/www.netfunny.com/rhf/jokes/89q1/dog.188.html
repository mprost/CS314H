I've got this compilation of variations on the "My Dog's Got no Nose" 
joke, which I thought you might like to use in rec.humor.funny.  I have 
read your list of submission guidelines, and I know that you don't like 
people to submit groups of jokes all at once, <B>but</B> ...  Well, when you 
have read through these, you will realise that a lot of them don't make 
sense out of context. 
<P>
You will be glad to see that these are all fully attributed.  Mike Taylor 
is me, Andy Charles, Andreas Pagel and Mike Lessacher are friends, and 
Andy Clews is a systems administrator I happen to be in email contact 
with, due to him liking the original MDGNN compendium, (which consisted 
basically of the first fourteen of these).  You should know that this 
subset of the following was posted to eunet.jokes, about 18 months ago, 
but that otherwise, these are all completely new. 
<P>
I hope you can use these, then.  Keep up the good work with the group!

1st Circumlocutionist:  I have in my possession an animal belonging to 
	the family Canidae, and it appears that he does not possess any 
	extra-facial olfactory organs. 
2nd Circumlocutionist: Could you therefore impart to me such knowledge as 
	may be necessary to describe how that animal circumvents the problem 
	of satisfying his olfactory senses? 
1st Circumlocutionist: Unfortunately the non-ambiguity of your enquiry does 
	not easily permit me to provide a clever answer, but I am in fact 
	thinking of referring the animal to an olfactologist. However, the 
	animal does have a fairly unpleasant body odour, should you be 
	interested.
