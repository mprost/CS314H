A young couple have just got married and are wandering through the countryside 
looking for somewhere to stay.  They come to a farm and knock on the door. 
The farmer answers the door and they explain how they have just got married, 
and don't have a lot of money but would like somewhere to stay for a few days. 
The farmer being a kind hearted soul offers them the hay loft in his barn, 
where they retire to immediately.  A few days go by and there is no sign of 
the young couple emerging from the barn.  After a week, the farmer becomes a 
bit concerned, so he goes out to the barn and shouts up, "Are you all right 
in there?" 
<P>
"Yes thank you," comes the reply. 
<P>
"Aren't you getting hungry?" asked the farmer,  "You haven't been out for a 
week." 
<P>
"It's all right," comes 
the reply, "we're living off the fruits of love." 
<P>
"Well," said the farmer, 
"I do wish you'd stop throwing the skins out the window!" 
<P>
