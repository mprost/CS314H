Taken from "The Jokes of Oppression: The Humor of Soviet Jews." 
<P>
Question:  What does friendship among Soviet nationalities mean? 
<P>
Answer:	   It means that the Armenians take the Russians by the hand; the 
Russians take the Ukrainians by the hand; the Ukrainians 
take the Uzbeks by the hand; and they all go and beat up 
the Jews. 
<P>
Question:  What's meant by an exchange of opinions in the Communist 
party of the Soviet Union? 
<P>
Answer:	   It's when I come to a party meeting with my own opinion, 
and I leave with the party's.

<P>
Three prison inmates were locked in the same cell; they soon began 
talking. 
<P>
"What are you here for?" asked one inmate of another. 
<P>
"They put me in for beating up some old Jew named Khaimovich," 
snarled one man. 
<P>
"And why are you here?" asked the second of the first. 
<P>
"For having defended some old Jew named Khaimovich in a fight," he 
replied. 
<P>
"And what were you arrested for?" the third inmate was asked. 
<P>
"For being Khaimovich," he sighed.
