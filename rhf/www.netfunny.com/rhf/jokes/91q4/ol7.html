<PRE>Here are more snippets from the one liner file.  While preparing RHF,
I collect short jokes that aren't quite worthy of an individual posting
in the one liner file.  Every so often I put digests of these out to
the group.  (Beware that some readers, such as NN, will mistakenly
present all these items in the digest as individual articles. 
Undigestification is a stupid kludge, but you have to live with it.)

These short items may contain swearing, mature themes and stereotypes.

I don't know how original this one is...I believe my Greek professor, 
Dr. MacAdoo from Va Tech, told it to me about 10 years ago.  I just found

Question:  What were the bride's thoughts while waiting for the marriage
ceremony to begin?

Answer:  Aisle.   Alter.   Hymn.

Subject:      Could this be the sequel to Arachnophobia?
From: NU021927@vm1.nodak.edu (Roy M. Jacobsen)

        A phobia is by definition an irrational fear.
Claustrophobia is an irrational fear of enclosed spaces.
Ailurophobia is an irrational fear of cats.  (And, as a friend of
mine has observed, tooraloorailurophobia is an irrational fear of
Irish cats.)

Taylor's Laws of Programming
============================

	(*)  Never write it in C if you can do it in `awk'.
	(*)  Never do it in `awk' if `sed' can handle it.
	(*)  Never use `sed' when `tr' can do the job.
	(*)  Never invoke `tr' when `cat' is sufficient.
	(*)  Avoid using `cat' whenever possible.
