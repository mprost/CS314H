<PRE>Here are more snippets from the one liner file.  While preparing RHF,
I collect short jokes that aren't quite worthy of an individual posting
in the one liner file.  Every so often I put digests of these out to
the group.  (Beware that some readers, such as NN, will mistakenly
present all these items in the digest as individual articles. 
Undigestification is a stupid kludge, but you have to live with it.)

These short items may contain swearing, mature themes and stereotypes.

This was taking from the 11/26/90 issue of the Gwinnett Daily <a href="News:">News:</a>

Something to think about...
   Radar spelled backwords is... radar.

This explains how state troopers can get you coming and going.

Jokes about Kenneth Clarke, when U.K. Secretary of State for
Health.

What do you call a man who ignores doctors' advice? The health
secretary.

Kenneth Clarke dies this morning. Doctors said his condition was
'satisfactory'.

Now that KC has become Education Secretary, the first joke has
been updated:

What do you call a man who doesn't listen to what his teachers
tell him? The education secretary.

May be offensive to some.  I heard this one from my wife.

Did you hear about our new local radio station?  Call letters are KPMS.  
The format is 3 weeks of the blues followed by a week of ragtime.

Subject: Rainman

It occurs to  me that in Rainman, when Tom Cruise says that Dustin
Hoffman should work for NASA and then changes his mind after the
doctor asks Hoffman how much would be left from a dollar if he
spent 50 cents and Hoffman replied 70 cents.  It seems to me that,
if he can spend money that way, that he should be working for the
government.

After all, at least he realizes that some is missing after he spends
it.

likelihood still is.

Subject: Sign of the Times.

This is a variant on an old joke as I understand it.  I do not know who
wrote it originally.  One day I found the first 3 lines on the whiteboard in
our CS department's lounge room, a few days later someone else added the
forth.  I added the last line.  It's probably the Quals Stress Syndrome. :-)

Subject: Original T-shirt message


Idea for a Zen T-shirt design (original):

	"Enlightment Available: Enquire Within"

Also seen (but not original):

A T-shirt with a picture of the Immortal Bard (not Bart) on it, and
the caption:
	"Will Power"

That leads me to the idea of a T-shirt with Bart Simpson on it:
	"The Immortal Bart"
