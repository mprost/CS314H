This is original;  it may not be funny to real adults who have never 
seen Pee-Wee's Saturday morning show;  my excuse is that I've got kids; 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
[scene opens in Pee-Wee's playhouse] 
<P>
Chairy: "Hey Pee-Wee, why don't we tell the boys and girls 
today's secret word?" 
<P>
Pee-Wee: "Good idea Chairy; let's ask Conky!" 
<P>
[Pee-Wee giggles impishly, and skips across the room to Conky, the robot] 
<P>
Pee-Wee: "What's the secret word today, Conky?" 
<P>
[Conky rattles and stutters for a moment, and a card pops out; 
Pee-Wee holds it in front of the camera for all to see...] 
<P>
Pee-Wee: "Well boys and girls, today's secret word is HANDJOB!; 
you all know what to do whenever anybody says the secret 
word--scream as loud as you can!;  let;s give it a try; (pause) 
Hey Conky, how come robots can't give themselves a HANDJOB?" 
<P>
[children scream, yell, cheer] 
<P>
[a knock at the door;  Pee-Wee skips over and answers; a black man dressed 
in overly-flamboyant western garb with a cowboy hat appears] 
<P>
Pee-Wee: "Why, its Cowboy Curtis, everyone;  Hi, Cowboy Curtis!" 
<P>
Cowboy Curtis: "WOOOO--WEEEE!;  I just had me one hell of a HANDJOB, Pee-Wee!" 
<P>
[children scream, yell, cheer;  Pee-Wee giggles impishly] 
<P>
Pee-Wee: "Why don't you tell the boys and girls at home all about it!" 
<P>
[Pee-Wee is interrupted by someone barging through the door] 
<P>
Pee-Wee: "Hey, boys and girls, it's Miss Evonne, the most beautiful woman 
in all of puppet land;  My, Miss Evonne-- you seem to be 
showing more cleavage than usual today (giggle giggle)." 
<P>
Miss Evonne gushes: "Why yes, Pee-Wee;  I was hoping Carlos would stop by" 
<P>
[a knock at the door;  Pee-Wee expects Cowboy Curtis to get it, but he seems 
to be involved in a little game he's discovered with Globe-y;  Pee-Wee skips 
over and opens the door;  a young Hispanic man, dressed in Soccer-player garb; 
close up of Miss Evonne gushing, and wetting her lips...]; 
<P>
Pee-Wee: "Hey, everybody, it's Carlos..." 
<P>
[Pee-Wee is interrupted by Miss Evonne who rudely squeezes past him, to get 
closer to Carlos] 
<P>
Miss Evonne: "Hi, Carlos; (gush gush) I was hoping you'd drop by; you know, 
its been a while since I've had a decent HANDJOB;" 
<P>
[children scream, yell, cheer;  Carlos blushes;  Pee-Wee giggles impishly] 
<P>
Carlos: "Well, you are the most beautiful woman in all of puppet land... 
maybe you could give me a HANDJOB first, si?" 
<P>
[children scream, yell, cheer] 
<P>
[another knock at the door;  Miss Evonne bounces over and answers;  an older 
black man dressed in a stunning outfit with a crown, and a middle-aged 
woman dressed in surfing-movie garb of the 60s] 
<P>
Pee-Wee: "Look, boys and girls;  it's Miss Renee and the King of Cartoons!" 
<P>
Miss Renee: "Well...  I always knew you people were swingers..." 
<P>
[attention focuses on the King;  the king postures, throws his arm in the 
air and exclaims his royal decree:] 
<P>
the King: "Ladies and Gentlemen; Boys and Girls; Let the HANDJOBS begin!!!" 
<P>
[children scream, yell, cheer;  Pee-Wee giggles impishly; 
story deteriorates to a low-budget porn flick.....
