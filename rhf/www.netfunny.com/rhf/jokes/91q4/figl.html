<PRE>A Rabbi walks into a bar to use the restroom. He walks up to the bartender,
and asks "Can I please use the restroom?" The  place was hopin with music, and
dancin, till they saw the Rabbi. The bartender says "I really don't think you
should" The Rabbi again, asks, "Can I please use the restroom?" Well,  the
bartender says to the Rabbi, "I really don't think you should you see, there
is a statue of a beautiful naked lady, and she's only covered by a fig leaf!"
The Rabbi responded with, "Nonsense a man of MY statue will not be bothered by
THAT statue!" Well,  the bartender showed the Rabbi the door at the top of the
stairs. The Rabbi proceeded to the restroom, and after a few minutes, he came
back out, and the whole place was hopin with music and dancin again! He went
to the bartender and said "Sir, I don't understand,  when I came in here, the
place was hopin with music and dancin, then the place became absolutely quiet.
I went to the restroom, and the place is hopin again." The bartender says,
"Well, now you're one of us now, can I get you a drink?" The Rabbi says, "I
still don't understand." The bartender told him, "You see, everytime the fig
leaf is lifted on the statue, the lights go out in the whole place, now, can I
get you a drink?"
