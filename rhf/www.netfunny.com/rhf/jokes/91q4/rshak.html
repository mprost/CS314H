<PRE>
	Do these guys at Radio Shack ever get on your nerves, asking you
for a bunch of personal data when you're just there to buy something as
simple as a couple AA batteries? I think we should inconvenience these
people as much as they do us. A while ago I was in Enid buying a printer
cable adaptor and the guy asked me for my name.

	"Ghosseindhatsghabyfaird-johnson" I replied
	(blank look of confusion)
	"How do you spell that?" he asked, obviously not wanting to know.
	"With a hyphen" I clarified
	"Once more?" he asked
	"Ghosseindhatsghabyfaird-johnson"
	"Could you please spell that?" he asked, glancing at the half dozen
people waiting behind me.
	"Oh... just like it sounds." I said nonchalantly.
	Putting down "Johnson", he went on and asked about the address.
	"Washburn, Wisconsin, 14701 N.E. Wachatanoobee Parkway, Complex 3, 
Building O, Appt. 1382b" I replied.
	Almost through writing all this down, I said "Or did you mean
current address?"
	Stoping, he said (becoming irritated) "Yes. Current address."
	"Diluthian Heights, Mississippi, 1372 S. Tinatonabee Avenue,
Building 14C, Suite 2, Box 138201." I replied quite slowly.
     	Waiting until he finished I said "No, wait, it's NORTH Tinatonabee
Avenue." Annoyed, he backed up and changed it.
	"I think." I interjected.
	"And is all this correct?" he asked in a standard manner.
	"Of course not." I replied, leaving, "If you want my REAL name and 
address, look at the damned credit card receipt."	
        A little mean, I must admit, but no jury would convict me... At least,
none that had been to Radio Shack.
