<PRE>Here are more snippets from the one liner file.  While preparing RHF,
I collect short jokes that aren't quite worthy of an individual posting
in the one liner file.  Every so often I put digests of these out to
the group.  (Beware that some readers, such as NN, will mistakenly
present all these items in the digest as individual articles. 
Undigestification is a stupid kludge, but you have to live with it.)

These short items may contain swearing, mature themes and stereotypes.

Subject: Syllogism on the new feminism

(An original by me and some friends, in response to the "Earth
Mothers" and "Women United in Their Oppression" movements. Must be
spoken for full effect.)


All women are close to nature.
Women vacuum.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
Therefore, all women are whores.

Subject: Time? Who's got time?

	College students are supposed to be busy normally, but I think we've
taken it to ridiculous extremes here. Consider the following:

Proposed t-shirt slogans:
"Swarthmore College. Where stress is an aquired taste."

"At other places it's called having fun. We call it procrastination."

And then there's the most effective pick-up line on campus:
"Hi, I'm not a major time commitment."
