One hot summer I worked for the "L'il Stinker" company, a guy down the 
street from us that pumped septic tanks.   It actually wasn't a bad 
job.  Most of my day was spent driving all over backwoods San Diego 
County in a big white pickup truck (San Diego County still had 
backwoods then).  My job was to get to the customer in advance of the 
tank truck, find the septic tank, and dig down to the lid so everything 
would be ready when "Sweeney" got there with the tank truck.  The tank 
truck was great--huge black monster with two white stripes running 
down the back, a picture of a skunk, and his phone number.  If you saw 
it once, you remembered it instantly whenever your toilets backed up. 
<P>
Over the course of the summer "Sweeney" told me a number of interesting 
and possibly true stories.  This has always been one of my favorites. 
<P>
Sweeney got called out to this house in Rancho Santa Fe, a very ritzy 
suburb.  Typical problem, the toilets are backing up.  Young husband 
answers the door, tells him the tank is "out there" somewhere.  Sweeney 
goes out, finds and uncovers the tank, takes a look inside.  It's got 
zillions of condoms happily floating on top of the, ah, other 
contents.  They've floated up against the outflow hole, thereby 
blocking up the whole system.  Sweeney walks back up to the house and 
brings the guy out to show him what the problem is.  The guy is 
obviously stunned, so Sweeney starts to explain that condoms don't do 
well in a septic tank.  The guy cuts him off and says between clenched 
teeth, "I don't use them."  He thinks it over for a minute, writes 
Sweeney a check for the full bill, and tells him to just leave it like 
it is.  To this day he has no idea what happened when the wife got home.
