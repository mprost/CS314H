<PRE>Here are more snippets from the one liner file.  While preparing RHF,
I collect short jokes that aren't quite worthy of an individual posting
in the one liner file.  Every so often I put digests of these out to
the group.  (Beware that some readers, such as NN, will mistakenly
present all these items in the digest as individual articles. 
Undigestification is a stupid kludge, but you have to live with it.)

These short items may contain swearing, mature themes and stereotypes.

        Here's another car ad we'll never see:

        For the fourth year in a row (1987-90) the Camaro is the most stolen
car in the USA.  Fourteen of the 20 most stolen cars in the USA in 1990 were GM
products.

I heard this on _Comic Strip Live_ last night...

So they're building this tunnel between France and England.
England drives on the left side of the road.
France drives on the right side of the road.

That's going to be one busy lane!!!!
