<PRE>Some of the dregs and later comments on the Judge Clarence Thomas
affair in the USA.

Subject: what's this?
From: ronnie@cisco.com (Ronnie Kon)

Q: What is this: "Good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning,
   good morning, nice tits, good morning, good morning"?

A: Clarence Thomas's first day at the Supreme Court.

Subject:      Clarence Thomas
From: SYSMATT@ukcc.uky.edu (Matt Simpson)

Senator: Judge Thomas, could you please explain to us your opinion
         on Roe vs. Wade.
Thomas: Senator, I haven't seen that one, but I loved Debbie does
        Dallas.

Subject: Clarence Thomas, et.al.
From: lth00@juts.ccc.amdahl.com (Lawrence T Hardiman)


Heard at work, I think.

Clarence Thomas is alleged to have said:
Being called unethical by Ted Kennedy is like being called slimy by a snail.

From: markh+@andrew.cmu.edu (Mark Held)

Original, of questionable taste.

Q:  What do you get when you cross Clarence Thomas and Long Dong Silver?


A:  The first throbbing member of the Supreme Court.

Subject: Headline Follies
From: dgross@viper.csc.calpoly.edu (Dave Gross)


	Cal Poly's conservative newspaper, the Poly Review, took a stand
	in its latest issue about the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings.
	Unfortunately, their headline may have given the wrong impression:

		IRONY OF HEARINGS:

		THOMAS SHOWS HE'S THE BIGGER MAN

From: djensen@claven.idbsu.edu (Dave Jensen)
Subject: Bush reveals truth about Clarence Thomas

Heard on radio news program while driving home just after the Thomas/senate
vote:

President Bush phoned Thomas to congratulate him...and among other
platitudes...said he was "an UNBELEIVABLE ROLE-MODEL for the nation."

Seems the truth comes out with when he doesn't use a script!

Subject: A Bridge In Massachusetts


To my mind the most memorable exchange that occurred during the
Thomas hearings was when Sen. Simpson blew up at Sen. Ted
Kennedy's comment regarding Prof. Hill, saying:

   "If you believe that, there's a bridge in Massachusetts I'd
    like to sell you."

Dear Ted might well be President if not for a bridge in
Massachusetts, if you recall.

I think that this is the closest we've some to hearing the 
word "Chappaquidick" on national television since the '80
Democratic Primaries.

(Simpson later apologised to Sen. Kennedy, saying that he meant
to say "Brooklyn".)

Subject: Clarence doth protest too much


It struck me during last week's hearings that Clarence Thomas seems the
sort of guy who would say just about anything to get himself off.
