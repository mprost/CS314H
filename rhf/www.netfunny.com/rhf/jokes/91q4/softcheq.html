<P>
<H4>AGREEMENT AND LIMITED WARRANTY</H4>
<P>
This check is fully warranted against physical defects and poor 
workmanship in its stationery. If the check is physically damaged, 
return it to me and I will replace or repair it at my discretion. 
No other warranty of any kind is made, neither express nor implied 
including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of 
Merchantability, Suitability for Purpose, and Validity of Currency. 
Any and all risk concerning the actual value of this check is 
assumed by you, the recipient. Even though I or my agents may have 
assured you of its worth, either verbally or in written 
communication, we may have had our fingers crossed, so don't come 
whimpering back to me if it bounces. 
<P>
The money, if any, represented by this instrument remains my 
property. You are licensed to use it, however you are not allowed 
to copy the original check except for your personal records, nor 
are you permitted to give the money itself to anyone else. Neither 
may you allow any other person to use the money. Remember, you may 
have it in your possession, but it still belongs to me, and I'm 
going to call on you from time to time just to keep tabs on it. 
<P>
This agreement supersedes all others between us, including the 
equally ridiculous one you have undoubtedly pasted on the back of 
your packaging, or concealed somewhere in the middle of it. The 
location of your version of this or any other covenant between us 
is irrelevant to its inapplicability here. Only this one pertains, 
and I really mean it. In fact, this one supersedes yours even 
though yours may say that it supersedes mine. Why, even if yours 
said it would supersede mine even if mine said it would supersede 
yours even if yours said... Oh well. You get the idea. 
<P>
You may decline this agreement by returning the uncashed check to 
me within twenty-four hours. If you attempt to cash it, however, 
you have implicitly accepted these terms. You may also implicitly 
accept these terms by: 
<P>
1) Calling my bank to inquire about the status of my account; 
<P>
2) Thanking me at the conclusion of our business transaction; 
<P>
3) Going to bed at the end of this or any other day; or 
<P>
4) Using any toilet or rest room. 
<P>
Please be advised that I have adopted a strict rubber-glue policy. 
Any nasty thing that your lawyers say bounces off of me and sticks 
back to you. Be further advised that you agree to pay my legal 
expenses if I decide to sue you for violating this agreement or for 
any other reason that might strike my fancy. Violations will be 
punishable by fine, imprisonment, death, any two of the above, or 
all three. 
<P>
Thank you and have a nice day! 
<P>
