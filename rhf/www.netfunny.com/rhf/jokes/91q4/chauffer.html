An astronomer on an extended lecture tour became weary of delivering the 
same lecture night after night.  He confided this state of mind to his 
chauffeur as they were driving to their next destination.  The chauffeur 
expressed a similar boredom in his line of work. 
<P>
"I've got it!" said the astronomer.  "You are bored with driving and I am 
weary of lecturing.  Let's exchange places for one night.  It will be a 
refreshing change for both of us.   My lecture is all written out word for word 
and nobody in the next town knows me by sight anyway."  The driver agreed and 
the exchange of roles and dress was made.  That night the lecture hall filled 
to capacity.  At the appointed time those in attendance heard a flawlessly 
delivered lecture.  At its conclusion the lecturer basked in the euphoric 
applause.  Then came the question and answer period. 
<P>
"Who discovered Uranus?" came from a boy in the front. 
<P>
"Uh...William Herschel."  He remembered that from somewhere. 
<P>
"And who discovered Pluto?" continued the boy. 
<P>
"Aaaa...that would be Clyde Tombaugh."  He had read a little. 
<P>
Then from the back:  "Would you please comment on the relative merits 
of the pulsation instability model and the accretion disk instability model for 
the explanation of outbursts of cataclysmic variable stars?" 
<P>
The speaker paused for a moment, then said, "I am surprised that you 
would bother to ask me such a simple question.  To show you how really simple 
it is I shall have my chauffeur answer it for you." 
<P>
