<PRE>From _The Exploits of the Incomparable Mullah Nasrudin_ by 
Indries Shah, The Octagon Press Ltd., London, 1983 as quoted in 
_Qualitative Evaluation and Research Methods_ by Michael 
Quinn Patton, Sage Publications, 1990.  Reprinted without 
permission.

A man had fallen between the rails in a subway station.  People 
were all crowding around trying to get him out before the train 
ran him over.  They were all shouting.  "Give me your hand!" 
but the man would not reach up.  Mulla Nasrudin elbowed his 
way through the crowd and leaned over the man.  "Friend," he 
asked, "what is your profession?"

"I am an income tax inspector," gasped the man.

"In that case," said Nasrudin, "take my hand!"

The man immediately grasped the Mulla's hand and was hauled 
to safety.  Nasrudin turned to the amazed by-standers.  "Never 
ask a tax man to give you anything, you fools."
