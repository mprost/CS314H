A farmer in the country noticed that a gentleman would fish 
at the lake (close to the farmer's house) and would always 
leave with a stringer full of fish.  The fellow had a boat 
but a fishing pole was not to be seen.  The farmer mentioned 
the situation to the lake ranger.  The ranger then started 
watching this man and all that the farmer said was true!  The 
man would arrive at the lake in the morning and by early 
afternoon, he had a stringer full of fish.  The ranger dressed 
like a fisherman one day and approached the man.  They exchanged 
pleasantries and the stranger asked the ranger in disguise to 
come fish with him.  They boated for 45 minutes and arrived at 
a secluded spot.  The stranger then pulled out a stick of dynamite. 
<P>
Ranger:  "I'm going to have to place you under arrest--I am 
a Ranger and you are fishing illegally!" 
<P>
The stranger calmly lit the stick of dynamite and handed it to 
the ranger. 
<P>
Stranger:  "Are you gonna talk or fish?"
