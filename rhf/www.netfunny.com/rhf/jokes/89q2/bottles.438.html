My dad found this on a bulletin board at work many years ago.  My 
sister recently found a copy hiding in some old school stuff she was 
throwing out.  A good challenge is to try to read the entire piece 
aloud without laughing.  Neither I nor my sister can do it.

The Eighteen Bottles 
<P>
I had eighteen bottles of whiskey in my cellar and was told by my 
wife to empty the contents of each and every bottle down the sink, or 
else...  I said I would and proceeded with the unpleasant task.  I 
withdrew the cork from the first bottle and pured the contents down the 
sink with the exception of one glass, which I drank.  I then withdrew 
the cork from the second bottle and did likewise with it, with the 
exception of one glass, which I drank.  I then withdrew the cork from 
the third bottle and poured the whiskey down the sink which I drank.  I 
pulled the cork from the fourth bottle down the sink and poured the 
bottle down the glass, which I drank.  I pulled the bottle from the 
cork of the next and drank one sink out of it, and threw the rest down 
the glass.  I pulled the sink out of the next glass and poured the cork 
down the bottle.  Then I corked the sink with the glass, bottled the 
drink and drank the pour.  When I had everything emptied, I steadied 
the house with one hand, counted the glasses, corks, bottles, and sinks 
with the other, which were twenty-nine, and as the houses came by I 
counted them again, and finally I had all the houses in one bottle, 
which I drank.  I'm not under tha affluence of incohol as some tinkle 
peep I am.  I'm not half as thunk as you might drink.  I fool so 
feelish I don't know who is me, and the drunker I stand here, the 
longer I get.
