After reading about a poor wretch who had become addicted to vi, I 
was inspired to compose the following ditty, sung to the tune of "Addicted To 
Love" by Robert Palmer. 
<P>
As you sing this, it may help the effect to imagine a dozen women, all of 
whom resemble Bill Joy, dressed in black and dancing sinuously. 
<P>
Addicted To Vi 
(with apologies to Robert Palmer) 
<P>
<PRE>You press the keys with no effect, 
Your mode is not correct. 
The screen blurs, your fingers shake; 
You forgot to press escape. 
Can't insert, can't delete, 
Cursor keys won't repeat. 
You try to quit, but can't leave, 
An extra "bang" is all you need. 
<P>
You think it's neat to type an "a" or an "i"-- 
Oh yeah? 
You won't look at emacs, no you'd just rather die 
You know you're gonna have to face it; 
You're addicted to vi! 
<P>
You edit files one at a time; 
That doesn't seem too out of line? 
You don't think of keys to bind-- 
A meta key would blow your mind. 
H, J, K, L?  You're not annoyed? 
Expressions must be a Joy! 
Just press "f," or is it "t"? 
Maybe "n," or just "g"? 
<P>
Oh--You think it's neat to type an "a" or an "i"-- 
Oh yeah? 
You won't look at emacs, no you'd just rather die 
You know you're gonna have to face it; 
You're addicted to vi! 
<P>
Might as well face it, 
You're addicted to vi! 
<P>
You press the keys without effect, 
Your life is now a wreck. 
What a waste!  Such a shame! 
And all you have is vi to blame. 
<P>
Oh--You think it's neat to type an "a" or an "i"-- 
Oh yeah? 
You won't look at emacs, no you'd just rather die 
You know you're gonna have to face it; 
You're addicted to vi! 
<P>
Might as well face it, 
You're addicted to vi!
