	 					Don't let on whut it's for. 
<P>
    1	  	big moonshahn crock, with lid. 	c'mon, ya gotta know 
		 			 i	where ta git basics! 
</FONT>
</PRE>
<P>
</PRE>Plus th' usual wahr an' stuff, as requahred. 
<P>
<H4>How d'ya do it, Joe?</H4>
<P>
Wal, ya find a ol' shack on a hill somewheres that still got pahr 
goin' to it.  (Elsewise, ya gots ta use a whole lotta ol' truck 
batt'ries, which is tuff ta hump around.) Put th' crock in th' shack, 
and pour th' Jolt water inta it.  Stir in th' Lithium Lye, slow an' 
careful. Don't splash none, an' don't add th' stuff too quick, now. 
Cover it real taht, so's ya don't lose too much. Y'all don't wanna 
hafta sneak inta th' navybase again, do ya? Them guys got guns &amp; stuff 
and they ain't afraid ta use it. 
<P>
So, ennyway, see, ya bild the pahr splah, an' ya bild th' currint 
reggalater in figger 3 at th' end of th' chapter, the one with the 
special shunt cirkit fer changin' the currint. Thet's whar th' 
Kickass tahmer goes. Test it ta be sure that th' current starts at 
about 30 amps and goes down ta 10 or 15 when th' tahmer goes off. 
<P>
Bild th' other stuff lahk in figger 2. Cart th' whole mess down ta th' 
shack, and put th' bizniz end inta the Jolt water. Don't leave th' lid 
off too long, now. Cover it up good, an' duck tape it, specially th' 
place wher the wahrs come out. Ah got me some motorcycle ground strap, 
which is read'ly avail'ble an' flat, so it don't queer up the fit o' 
the lid. Bolt the straps down real secure, an' put vaseline on th' 
bolts. 
<P>
Now, set th' Kickass tahmer fer 8 weeks, plug th' pahr splah in, 
make sure ya got 30 amps, an' take a hike. 
<P>
'Member, neutrons ain't yer frens. Keep ol' Blue away from th' shack 
unless ya want two-headed puppies runnin' around eatin' too much, 
probly worrit yore mom no end, an' if ya gotta go in ther ta check, 
don't stay long. Ya want ol' Joe's advice, after around 7 weeks, don't 
go in ther atall. 
<P>
This hear makes a real 'hot flash', an' in fact, it's whut this book 
is named fer. Y'all kin see th' flash from a couple mahls away, raht 
through th' av'ridge wall, so don't go bildin' it in yer basemit. Got 
thet?  No need ta keep it too close ta home, raht? Ya kin get caught 
with it if it's too close. Besides, ya don't want yer sister fahndin' 
out wher her earrin's got off ta. She probly woont lahk it, an' she'll 
make ya cut her in on the deal. 'Course, thet maht not be too bad, if 
she's good with a soldrin' ahrn. Probly bilds good pahr splahs, an 
that's importunt ta this 'hot flash'. 
<P>
Ah got trouble, Joe. Now whut? 
<P>
<!--  v-->
<PRE><!-- Unknown %s trans--><P>
<P>
Whut happen			Whut ta do 
<P>
<HR>
ya hair falls out	Dummy! I tol' ya not ta stan' aroun' up 
in hanks		close-lahk! Thow away yer clothin', an' 
			take lots o' shahrs. Eat some vitamin E, 
			an' call th' doc ef'n it don't stop in 
			a spell. 
<P>
red skin &amp; funny spots	same thing. 
<P>
juice won't drop to	shunt circuit screwed up, or ya bought a cheap 
10-15 amps		tahmer. Don't bah you no cheap tahmers! 
<P>
no flash after 8	th' Authority mebbe cut yer pahr. Wait 2 more 
weeks is gone bah	weeks an' then check fer pahr at the wall sockit. 
			Ef thet don't work, check the pahr splah. Ah 
			tol' ya yer sister probly bild it better then 
			you, ya shoulda listened. Also check th' 
			tahmer. 'Member whut ah sed about cheap ones! 
<P>
Big wet spot		ya crock leak? If no leaks, check the roof. If 
			the roof leaks, don't worrit yerself. If th' 
			crock leaks, fix it quick. 
<P>
'lectrode turns brown	probly yer Lithium Lye is contaminatid. Ya can 
			give it up, or start over. 
<P>
runs hot		only happins once in a whahl. Swipe Grampa's 
			ol' still-tubin', an' make lahk a li'l still 
			coil with it. Jes' run th' outlet back inta 
			the crock. Duck tape the whole mess real good. 
			If thet ain't enuf, use a truck radiater. 
			Don't drink the stuff, neither! Taste lahk 
			hell, take it from one that knows. 
</PRE>
<P>
</PRE>Y'all have fun, now. Ef ya hit the sweet spot, th' hill will glow fer 
munths. Thet means you done real good! Set up a "myst'ry spot" sahn, 
an' charge th' city folks a dollar a look. 
<P>
Yore Frend, 
<P>
Joe
