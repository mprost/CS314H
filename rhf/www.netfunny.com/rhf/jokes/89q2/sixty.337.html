<PRE>I wish I could remember where this came from, but I've had it lingering around 
my various computer systems since 1982 or so.

<P>
Morley Safer:  Good Evening. 
        Tonight, Sixty Minutes is breaking with out usual free-form 
        format to present a special edition concerning the truly heinous 
        crimes that have come to our attention in recent months. 
<P>
Dan Rather:  We will look at the story of Billy Joe Kupertino, who murdered 
        27 young boys after sexually molesting them with Tootsie Roll Pops 
        and Trix cereal. 
<P>
MS:  And the story of shoddy workmanship at Herb's Airlines, which was 
        responsible for the deaths of more than 3,000 people in the recent 
        Hollywood Bowl crash of an elongated jumbo jet. 
<P>
DR:  But first, a story so unbelievable, so incredibly bizarre and hideous, 
        that the Sixty Minutes staff, used to horror in real life, was 
        completely shocked by what we learned.  It involves a massive 
        Department of Defense computer network, national security, and 
        high school students.  It also strikes right to the bone of the 
        American way and apple pie. 
<P>
MS:  We call this story the TELENET TERROR, and you'll soon see why... 
<P>
CUT TO: 
Extreme close-up of IMP display register.  Lights flashing.  Gradually 
the camera pulls back to reveal the entire unit.  There is scribbled 
graffiti all over the gray outside cover, including such anecdotes as 
"CBS SUCKS" and "FREE PAT PAULSON." 
<P>
MS:  This is an IMP, not the sprightly little character you read about 
        as a child, this IMP is Satin incarnate himself. 
<P>
DR:  Standing for Interface Message Processor, the IMP is a specialized 
        minicomputer, with ENORMOUS processing power. 
<P>
MS:  Yes, this device could add up a series of 200 fourteen digit numbers 
        faster than you could say "Neilson Rating." 
<P>
DR:  At least one of these devices sits in every missile base, military 
        research establishment, and many private firms, universities, 
        and other subversive organizations. 
<P>
MS:  And they are all linked together by these thin cables here (holds up 
        twisted pair of red and white cable leading to clock radio on desk) 
        to form the most insidious NETWORK of computers ever dreamed 
        of in the worst of our nightmares. 
<P>
DR:  This is the TELENET.  Operated by a little known organization in the 
        Dept. of Defense, this network, originally designed as a research 
        and development tool, has become the toy of high school students 
        and the right hand of subversive organizations throughout the 
        country. 
<P>
MS:  We first learned of this incredible story when a twelve year old boy 
        called the Sixty Minutes staff complaining that he was no longer able 
        to play his favorite computer game, called ZORK, due to the 
        implementation of something called TIP LOGIN in his area.  We 
        sensed a big story immediately, and put the full resources of CBS 
        behind the investigation.  What we learned was truly incredible. 
        After a series of interviews with high-school students around the 
        country, we learned that 83% of the computer club high school 
        students in the United States regularly use and abuse the TELENET. 
        This was a larger percentage, by the way, than had passed puberty. 
<P>
DR:  And their power and influence over the department of defense could 
        hardly be underestimated.  This tape should demonstrate. 
<P>
CUT TO VIDEOTAPE 
<P>
Wimpy High School Kid:  Yeah, I've just dialed the TIP phone number, 
        and now I've put the phone into this modem. 
<P>
DR:  What is a "MODEM" ? 
<P>
Kid:  It stands for Modus Operandi Device for Evil Motives. 
<P>
DR:  Oh. 
<P>
Kid:  Now  I have to log into the TIP.  Let's see now, which name should I 
        use?  Oh, here's a good one (as he refers to a long list written on the 
        back of a bubblegum wrapper).

DR:  What is this "Adventure"? 
<P>
Kid:  We won't bother with that, I already got all the main points. 
<P>
DR:  This is some sort of simulation, right? 
<P>
Kid:  Oh no.  This is real.  I never DID like New York. 
<P>
DR:  Well, this is horrible.  Is there any way to stop it? 
<P>
Kid:  Well, yeah.  If you really want to.

CUT TO DAN RATHER 
<P>
DR:  Well folks, you saw it.  A twelve year old boy almost obliterated 
        New York City with a 50 megaton nuclear blast. 
<P>
MS:  Yes, and imagine what he might have done if he were angry! 
<P>
DR:  Too bad he can't just hit ABC with a small tactical nuclear... 
<P>
MS:  Dan! 
<P>
DR:  I was just kidding, Morley.  Haw haw haw. 
<P>
MS:  You sound like Tom Snyder. 
<P>
DR:  Maybe we could get him with the same blast. 
<P>
MS:  Let's be serious, Dan. 
<P>
DR:  Yes.  Well.  Ahem.  We decided to go directly to the top when we 
        realized how serious the situation was.  We went directly to 
        the home of Senator Proxmire in Washington, D.C. 
<P>
CUT TO VIDEOTAPE 
<P>
MS:  Here we are at the home of Senator Proxmire, the developer of the 
        famous Golden Fleece Award, given to those government 
        agencies that have done the most to waste the taxpayers' money. 
<P>
        (Dan and Morley walk up to door and ring doorbell) 
<P>
        (Doorbell rings to tune of "Funeral Dirge") 
<P>
Seven Year Old Child:  Hello? 
<P>
DR:  Hello.  We're here from Sixty Minutes.  Is your daddy home? 
<P>
Child:  Yeah.  He's home.  Come on in. 
<P>
        (They enter) 
<P>
        (Senator Proxmire is sitting at the kitchen table hunched before 
        a Silent 700 terminal.  He is cursing under his breath....) 
<P>
Proxmire:  God DAMN IT!  I just DON'T see how to get around this snake. 
<P>
Child:  Daddy!  Someone's here for yo.... 
<P>
P:  Shut up, squirt.  Can't you see I'm busy?  Hmmm.  Now maybe if I 
        eat the bird as a snack.... 
<P>
DR:  Senator?  This is Dan Rather of Sixty Minutes.... 
<P>
MS:  And I'm his lovable sidekick, Morley Safer. 
<P>
P:  HUH?  Yes.  Uh.  (He reaches behind his back and covertly attempts 
        to remove the phone from a Radio Shack modem and hang 
        it up.) 
<P>
DR:  We're here in connection with out TELENET inquiry, Sir. 
<P>
P:  Oh yes.  Well, since your office called, I've had my staff investigating 
        this whole matter.  And I was shocked.  Simply shocked!  (As he 
        (speaks, he is rolling up the output from the terminal and 
        crumpling it into a little ball). 
<P>
MS:  Sir, what do you intend to do about this situation? 
<P>
P:  Well, uh, it appears to be a very, very complex matter.  Uh, we don't 
        want to jump to any, uh, conclusions about this type of thing. 
        After all, National Security IS at stake here, ya' know. 
<P>
DR:  Yes, Sir.  But I thought you said you were shocked. 
<P>
P:  Well, er, yes. 
<P>
Child:  Daddy, can I play ZORK now? 
<P>
P:  Get the HELL away from here kid;   you bother me. 
<P>
DR:  Did he say ZORK? 
<P>
MS:  Did he say ZOOORRRRRRKKKKKK? 
<P>
P:  No, he said, uh, Mork.  That's it, he said, "Mork."  It's a new game 
        based on that "Mork and Mindy" show.  You've seen it? 
<P>
MS:  I'm afraid not, sir.  I believe it's on a competing network. 
<P>
P:  Oh, well.  Whatever, I don't.... 
<P>
Child:  Daddy!  I want to get more ZORKmids. 
<P>
P:  Will you PLEASE get away from here.  Go to your room and play with 
        your blue box. 
<P>
Child:  OK, Daddy.  (Child exits) 
<P>
DR:  Now Senator, if you will.... 
<P>
P:  My how time flies.  I just realized that I have an important meeting 
        on the hill.  Can't waste taxpayers' money, you know.  Gotta 
        get going. 
<P>
MS:  But Senator!  What about the TELENET issue?  We are very 
        concerned. 
<P>
P:  Oh yes.  Well, I suggest you just drop the whole issue.  You know, 
        hush it up. 
<P>
DR:  You can't be serious.  ARPANETGATE? 
<P>
P:  Well, whatever you call it.  I have to leave now, gentlemen, let 
        me show you to the door. 
<P>
CUT TO DAN AND MORLEY 
<P>
DR:  Confused?  Not half as much as we were.  Our meeting with the 
        Senator caused more questions than it answered. 
<P>
MS:  And we were no closer to understanding the issue then we 
        were at the beginning. 
<P>
DR:  We've decided to continue the investigation at another time, 
        when more information is available.  We certainly do not 
        want to unjustly condemn a whole project simply based on 
        a few minor transgressions such as the ones we've seen. 
<P>
MS:  (whispers)  Dan, C'mon.  It's time for today's SF-LOVERS 
        digest. 
<P>
DR:  (whispers)  Right, Morley. 
<P>
DR:  We'll be back in the near future with more on this important 
        issue. 
<P>
        (Both rush from stage.  Dan's lapel microphone rips off and 
        falls to the floor, taking a chunk of lapel with it.  Stage is 
        empty.  Stagehand rushes out, stares incredulously at the 
        camera for a moment, then starts waving his arms madly. 
        We see a burst of color bars accompanied by a steady tone, 
        and then....)
