Great Rules for writing from William Safire in the New York Times. 
<P>
Do not put statements in the negative form. 
And don't start sentences with a conjunction. 
It is incumbent on one to avoid archaisms. 
If you reread your work, you will find on rereading that a great deal  
   of repetition can be avoided by rereading and editing. 
Never use a long word when a diminutive one will do. 
Unqualified superlatives are the worst of all. 
De-accession euphemisms. 
If any word is improper at the end of a sentence, a linking verb is. 
Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky. 
Never, ever use repetitive redundancies. 
Also, avoid awkward or affected alliteration. 
Last, but not least, avoid cliche's like the plague.
