May 2: Drs. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann, whose claims to have 
demonstrated room-temperature fusion were roundly criticized at a 
meeting of the American Physical Society last night, announced a new 
breakthrough in room-temperature fusion technology in a press 
conference at the University of Utah today. 
<P>
Nicknamed the `room-temperature fusion bomb', their new process is 
a logical outgrowth of one of their earlier experiments in which 
an electrode melted, destroying part of their experimental apparatus. 
``We concluded that clever design of the palladium electrode can 
drastically affect the release of energy.  We've developed (and are 
in the process of patenting) our new `chunky electrode' technology, which 
allows us to tailor energy production to the desired application.  The 
room-temperature fusion bomb employs an `extremely chunky' electrode.'' 
<P>
Pons and Fleischmann say that they have been sensitive to the criticism 
recently leveled at their experimental methods; however, they remain 
convinced that room-temperature fusion is occurring in their 
experiments.  They plan to Federal Express one room-temperature 
fusion bomb experiment to each member of the American Physical Society. 
<P>
``Operating instructions for the apparatus have not yet been photocopied. 
They will be sent via first-class mail when they're ready in a week or so,'' 
said Pons.
