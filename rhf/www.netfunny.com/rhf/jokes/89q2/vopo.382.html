<PRE>	Joke from East Germany, heard on recent trip to Berlin:


	One sunny day on the North Sea a creative little boy was
playing in the sand trying to decide what to make.  He discovered some
Scheiss (you can guess what that is) on the  beach so he decided to make
a VoPo (People's Policeman).  Just as he was finishing, along comes a VoPo,
trying to make sure no one swims to Denmark.  He decides to ask the
little boy what that ugly thing made of Scheiss is.  The little boy
responds:  "It's a VoPo!"   So the officer beats him.

	The next day, the boy is on the beach making the same creation
when that same officer comes along and sees the boy is playing with the
Scheiss again, and asks what he is doing.  The boy responds "I'm making
another VoPo!"   So the officer beats him.

	The  day after that, the officer is strolling the beach, sees
the boy playing just with sand, and is glad to see he has switched his
medium.  So he asks boldly "what are you making today?"  The boy
responds:  "A  G.I.!" The officer asks: "And why not a VoPo?"  The boy
responds:  "Couldn't find any Scheiss."


	(*)  A "VoPo" is an affectionate( :-&gt; ) name for omnipresent
Volks Polizei (Peoples Police).

	If you don't know: Scheiss in English would be the same word where
ss=t, c=e=NULL .
