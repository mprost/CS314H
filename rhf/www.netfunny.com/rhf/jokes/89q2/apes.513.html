"De banaan wordt bespreekbaar," cultuurverandering in 
ambtelijk en politiek Groningen. door Tom Pauka en 
Rein Zunderdorp (Nijgh en van Ditmar, 1988)

"The banana becomes open to discussion," cultural changes in 
administrative and political Groningen (city in Netherlands) by 
Tom Pauka and Rein Zunderdorp (Nijgh and van Ditmar, 1988)] 
<P>
Red-tapism: 
<P>
Take a cage with apes.  In the cage we hang a banana on a string, 
and put stairs under it.  Before long an ape goes to the stairs 
towards the banana, but as soon as it even touches the stairs, 
all apes are sprayed with water. After a while the same ape or 
another one makes another attempt, with the same result: all 
apes are sprayed. If later another ape tries to climb the 
stairs, the others will try to prevent it. 
<P>
Now we take one ape from the cage and put in a new one. The new 
ape sees the banana, and wants to climb the stairs. To his 
horror all other apes attack him. After another attempt he 
knows: if he wants to climb the stairs, he is beaten up. Then we 
remove a second ape and replace it by another new one. The 
newcomer goes to the stairs and gets beaten up. The previous 
new ape takes part in the punishment with enthusiasm. 
<P>
A third old ape is replaced by a third new one. The new one 
makes it to the stairs and get beaten up as well. Two of the 
apes who beat him, have no idea why you may not climb the stairs. 
We replace the fourth old ape, and the fifth, etc. until all 
apes which ones have been sprayed with water have been replaced. 
Nevertheless, no ape ever tries to climb the stairs. 
<P>
"But Sir, why not?" 
<P>
"Because that's the way we do things here, lad."
