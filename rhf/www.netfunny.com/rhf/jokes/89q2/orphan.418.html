I heard this one a few years ago in East Germany..... 
<P>
Erich Honnecker (the president of East Germany) was invited to Moscow 
by Gorbachev for a visit.  After weeks of preparation by Gorby, 
Honnecker arrives in Moscow.  As part of of celebration activities, 
there is a big parade through the streets of Moscow. 
<P>
While the two are watching the parade, Gorbachev takes a small boy 
aside and asks him, "Who is your mother?"  The child replies, "Mother 
Russia."  "And who is your father?" asks Gorbachev.  The boy answers, 
"Why, it's you Uncle Gorbachev!"  Finally Gorbachev asks the boy, "and 
what do you want to be when you grow up?"  The boy proudly replies, 
"a good communist!" 
<P>
Erich Honnecker, meanwhile, has been watching this and is very 
impressed.  So impressed, that he decides to invite Gorbachev to 
[East] Berlin for a visit.  Again, after weeks of preparation, 
Gorbachev's plane lands in Berlin.  And again, part of the celebration 
includes a parade. 
<P>
Remembering what Gorbachev did in Moscow, Honnecker repeats the scene: 
He asks a little boy in the crowd, "Who is your mother?"  The child 
replies "the GDR [German Democratic Republic--East Germany]."  "And 
who is your father?" asks Honnecker.  "Why, it's you Uncle Honnecker!" 
replies the child.  "And what do you want to be when you grow up?" 
queries Honnecker.  Without hesitation, the boy replies, "an orphan." 
<P>
