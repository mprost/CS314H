The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. 
Your question was: 
<!-- Unknown %s typeface--><P>
<P>
What did the Tibetan monk say to the hot dog vendor? 
<P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
The most famous exchange between a lama and a hot dog vendor occurred 
one block south of Times Square in July 1988. 
<P>
Hot Dog Vendor: What can I get for ya today?  Footlong 
with the works?  I said, what can I get 
for ya today?  Hey, ya wanna hot dog or 
not?  Listen if yer not going to order 
willya move on, I gotta business to run. 
Stop starin' at me, man.  And wipe that 
silly grin off yer face.  Say something, 
dammit, yer givin' me the creeps.  Hey, 
I get it.  Ya don't any English, do ya? 
Uh, lessee, yo, uh, tengo los, uh, hot 
dogs, uh, perros calientes.  Okay, fine! 
just stand there.  See if I care.  Just 
don't scare away the customers.  Jeez. 
Forget it.  Ya wanna Coke?  Coca-cola? 
I don't care where yer from, ya gotta 
understand "Coca-cola."  Coca-cola? 
Stop smiling.  People'll think yer up 
to something.  Hey, I got all-beefs, 
beef-n-porks, turkey dogs, polish 
sausage, and kielbasa.  You can get 
ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, 
pickles, or onions on them.  I've got 
plain and whole grain buns.  I don't 
care what you want, just order something 
or leave.  I'm serious, man, if you don't 
go away, I'll call the cops and have them 
arrest you for loitering.  Jesus Christ, 
will you stop staring at me!  STOP IT! 
At least blink once in a while.  You're 
driving me crazy!  You wanna Coke?  Wait, 
no, I already tried that.  Listen, man, 
I'm serious, stop starin' and grinnin' at 
me.  I gotta gun under the counter.  I'll 
use it.  I mean it.  STOP STARING AT ME! 
STOP IT!  STOP IT!  STOPITSTOPITSTOPIT! 
YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY!  AAAAARGH! 
STOPITSTOPITSTOPITSTOPIT!  PLEASE LOOK 
AWAY!  HERE!  OKAY!  I'M MAKING YOU A 
HOT DOG FOR FREE!  TAKE IT!  EAT IT! 
JUST GO AWAY!  STOPITSTOPITSTOPITSTOPIT! 
YOU WANNA COKE?  OKAY!  HERE'S A COKE! 
IT'S ON THE HOUSE!  NOW PLEASE GO AWAY! 
I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE OF THIS!  YOUR 
EYES ARE DRIVING ME INSANE!  PLEASE 
STOPITSTOPITSTOPISTOPSTOPSTOPSTOPSTOPSTOPSTOPSTOP! 
<P>
Then the lama widened his grin just enough to barely show 
his teeth.  At that moment the hot dog vendor was 
enlightened. 
<P>
You owe the Oracle a better koan.  And a new deli.

<P>
so what do I do???????? 
<P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

My, my.  Five words, eight question marks.  You must like punctuation 
more than you like writing.  No matter, I <I>like</I> writing. 
<P>
WELCOME TO THE ORACULAR VERSION OF "WHAT'S MY LINE?" THE INTERNET'S 
FAVORITE GAME SHOW.  HERE IS YOUR HOST, THE ORACLE. 
<P>
(applause) 
<P>
Thank you, and welcome to "What's My Line."  Please meet the 
distinguished members of our panel: 
<P>
Our first panelist is the hottest thing on Broadway since Nathan's added 
peppers to their hot dogs.  Please welcome Andrew Lloyd Webber. 
<P>
(applause) 
<P>
(singing) I'm really glad to be here tonight, Although I've just had a 
terrible fright, Aspects of Love recently closed, Guess I'll have to 
stay on my toes. 
<P>
Our second panelist is the producer of "Twin Peaks," David Lynch. 
<P>
(applause) 
<P>
The shadow of the evening will underscore the futility of life.  Are 
there to be more deaths once the shortage of Saran Wrap is over? 
<P>
Our third panelist is the boy wonder of Redmond, Washington, Bill Gates. 
<P>
(applause) 
<P>
The User Interface for the USENET Oracle is directly copied from 
Windows.  You'll be hearing from our lawyers, assuming Scully doesn't 
file suit first. 
<P>
Our final panelist is none other than the ghost of Bennet Cerf. 
<P>
(applause) 
<P>
Thank you John, I mean Oracle.  It's true that the quality of mercy is 
not strained.  These days, its pureed. 
<P>
Will tonight's mystery guest sign in please. 
<P>
(scribble scribble) 
<P>
Now panel, please remember to ask questions that can be answered Yes or 
No.  We'll begin our questioning with Mr. Webber: 
<P>
(singing) You type like a hurried lad, are you perhaps an undergrad? 
<P>
Guest:  No. 
<P>
Oracle:  That's one down and nine to go.  Mr Lynch: 
<P>
Damn, that's good singing!  Are you employed in something which requires 
very little training, then? 
<P>
Guest:  Yes. 
<P>
The Log Lady thinks you might be a computer salesman.  Are you? 
<P>
Guest:  No. 
<P>
Oracle:  That's two down and eight to go.  Mr Gates: 
<P>
My question is in beta test and will be available during the third 
quarter. 
<P>
Oracle:  That's three down and seven to go.  Mr. Cerf: 
<P>
Are you, perhaps, one of the voice stand-ins for Milli Vanilli? 
<P>
Guest:  No. 
<P>
Oracle:  That's four down and six to go.  Back to you, Mr. Webber. 
<P>
(singing) Cats are mystical, and so I say, Do you work mostly by day? 
<P>
Guest:  Yes. 
<P>
At last the puzzle starts to unravel, does your work require a lot of 
travel? 
<P>
Guest:  Yes. 
<P>
I ask two questions, twice I get 'yes', are you, perhaps, a stewardess? 
<P>
Guest:  No. 
<P>
Oracle:  That's five down and five to go.  Mr Lynch: 
<P>
Diane, I'm sitting on the panel of this ficticious game show, being 
created by an otherwise bored computer geek.  Get his address in case we 
need some odd character for the season finale.  Does your work involve 
driving a vehicle? 
<P>
Guest:  No. 
<P>
Oracle:  That's six down and four to go.  Mr. Gates: 
<P>
Having acquired the software division of Mr Lynch's company, we have 
released a patch to version 1.0 of his question.  Are you a computer 
saleswoman? 
<P>
Guest:  No. 
<P>
Oracle:  That's seven down and three to go.  Mr. Cerf: 
<P>
Your typing sounds familiar.  Didn't I see you on the Letterman show? 
<P>
Guest:  Yes and No. 
<P>
Oracle:  We'll interpret that as a yes. 
<P>
Are you a member of that most octavian fraternity, a musician? 
<P>
Guest:  No. 
<P>
Oracle:  That's eight down and two to go.  Mr. Webber: 
<P>
(singing) The questioning is nearly done, are you the producer's son? 
<P>
Guest:  No. 
<P>
Oracle:  That's nine down and one to go.  Mr Lynch, I'm sorry but your 
question was acquired by Mr. Gates' company which has elected to 
withdraw it from the market in favor of Excel.  That's ten down 
and none to go.  Mystery guest, would you identify yourself, 
please. 
<P>
Guest:  I'm Dan Quayle. 
<P>
Panel:  Who? 
<P>
Oracle:  That's all the time we have today.  Thank you for tuning in and 
tune in next time for the Oracular version of "What's My Line." 
<P>
(applause)

Dear Oracle, wise one, 
My school just built a new athletic building.  What is its scriptural 
significance? 
<P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
Scriptural significance?   Hmm. . . let me check.  The only scriptural

Oh wisest of the wise oracle, please explain to me, 
<P>
Why is it that every time a female describes her relationship 
with me, the word 'plutonic' is always used? 
<P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

They mean that, like Pu-225, your relationship had a half-life

Oracle of wonders, 
I want to marry my girlfriend Cathy.  What does our future look 
like?  Children?  Money?  Affairs? 
<P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
Your future looks bleak, oh young hormone-infested mortal.  Your 
inability to communicate in complete sentences will be nothing but 
trouble for you.  You will drive Cathy crazy saying things like, "How 
are the wedding invitations coming?  Envelopes?  Stamps?  Post?" Later, 
after you are married, Cathy will become increasingly irritable after 
being exposed to your odd mannerism for a month or two.  "Honey, where 
are my socks?  Argyle?  Sweat?  Dark?" Unfortunately, things will only 
go downhill from there.  "Cathy, why don't we have any friends?  Turtle? 
Banana?  Apocalypse?" You will become increasingly moody and withdrawn. 
"Dammit, don't let the Kaiser steal my string!  Swingtown!  Megaphone? 
Grunties." As a last ditch effort, Cathy will dunk your head in a vat of 
strawberry yogurt to shake this affliction from you.  Ultimately, you 
will die a solitary man, feeble and wrinkled.  Your last words being, 
"Curse you Red Baron!  You and all your ugly kin!  Greenspan?  Rosebud! 
Phlegm." Hey, you asked. 
<P>
You owe the Oracle a Sears mediterranian style color console television

<P>
If a user is really stupid, and just can't quite grasp the concept of 
a high-density vs. a low density disk, is it OK to shoot them? 
<P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
No, but you're on the right track.  Here's how to explain it, using a 
coffee can, some water, and a gun. 
<P>
Fill the coffee can with water and set it on the table next to the 
user.  Tell him that this is like a high-density floppy disk, which 
can hold quite a bit of water (ie. data.  Since your user is stupid 
you may have to explicitly point this out.) 
<P>
Aim the gun at the can and shoot a hole in the side.  Some of the 
water will run out.  Explain that by decreasing the density of the 
metal making up the can (by introducing discontinuity,) you have 
lowered the storage capacity of said can.  Mention that a similarity 
exists between coffee cans and diskettes. 
<P>
Now turn to face the user.  Act like you've forgotten you're still 
holding the gun, but actually, aim it carefully at the user's 
chest.  Ask him if he understands the difference now. 
<P>
If he doesn't, you have a perfect legal right and moral responsibility 
to shoot him.  But try not to let him get blood on the computers. 
<P>
You owe the Oracle six kilowatt-hours.
