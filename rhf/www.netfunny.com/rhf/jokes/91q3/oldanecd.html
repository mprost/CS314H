<blockquote>I agree that The Bay is a very special company for Canada for its long and 
"colourful" history, but I <B>think</B> it's a youngster in comparison to certain 
European companies (although I couldn't name one). I remember hearing a story 
of an American company negotiating a business deal with a Swedish steel 
company. In the proposition sent to Europe, the American company mentioned 
some reliability concerns and asked for proof that they could count on 
the Swedish company still being there in a year. In a terse letter, the 
Swedish firm replied that since they had existed more than four times the 
age of the USA, they didn't see why they would not be there the next year...

Comparable anecdote #1:  At the 350th anniversary celebrations of 
Harvard University, one speaker said, "Harvard is intimately bound 
up with the history and culture of the United States--an innovation 
in which we have taken considerable interest." 
<P>
Comparable anecdote #2:  Someone has calculated that there are in Europe 
26 (this number is my best recollection of what was said) organizations 
that have been in continuous existence for at least five hundred years: 
the Parliament at Westminster, the Althing (parliament) of Iceland, the 
Roman Catholic Church, and 23 universities.

Anecdote #3, told by Greg Benford:   At an Oxford college, they were 
debating what to do with all their money.   The consensus was to buy land, 
since "for the past thousand years, land has proven to be a very wise 
investment for the college." 
<P>
The crusty old patriarch piped in, "True, but the past thousand years have 
been atypical."
