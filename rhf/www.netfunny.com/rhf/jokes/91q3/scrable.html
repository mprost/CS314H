This was my second Institute of Fuzzy Science bulletin.  Readers of 
sci.physics, among others, should appreciate it.

Crank Unified Theories:  The CUTting edge of Fuzzy Science 
<P>
Quite recently the Institute of Fuzzy Science has announced 
the discovery of several bold new theories, providing a unified 
explanation, or at least excuse, for a broad range of natural 
phenomena.  These theories are both extremely ambitious in their 
scope and modest in their assumptions.  Their main trait is that 
they deduce a great deal from practically nothing. 
<P>
The creation of Crank Unified Theories is an old and honorable 
tradition, dating back to prehistoric times, when our ancient 
ancestors looked around them and asked, "How the heck did <B>this</B> all 
get here?"  The process was lent considerable prestige by such 
luminaries as Aristotle and Ptolemy, in the classical age, and 
continues up to this day.  One recent idea by a worker outside the 
Institute was Photon Mechanics, which postulated that all 
fundamental particles were composed of photons.  In an attempt to 
prove this, he tried to synthesize a meal from gamma rays. 
Unfortunately, the food immediately propagated away at 299,000 
kilometers per second, leaving critics of the light lunch 
unsatisfied. 
<P>
"Terrible," one physicist commented.  "Much too bland."  Others 
seemed to agree. 
<P>
The CUTs produced at the Institute of Fuzzy Science are 
notable in that they all contradict each other, and sometimes 
themselves.  Thus, few would argue that all, or even most, are 
correct.  The most successful theory to date is that of Dr. Isaac M. 
Woozy, commonly known as Woozy Theory.  Woozy Theory has 
proven capable of predicting practically anything you put to it. 
<P>
What is Woozy Theory?  In its simplest outlines, it is an 
attempt to describe nature by unifying three separate realms of 
observation:  General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, and Scrabble. 
By adopting a three pronged approach the theory is able to resolve 
the apparent contradictions between each of the sub-theories. 
<P>
"I believe that the problems of earlier researchers," stated Dr. 
Woozy, "arose from treating the subjects piecemeal.  A unified 
approach is required."  He cites difficulties with Superstring 
Theory, Quantum Scrabble, and Scrabble in Curved Spacetime.  In 
each case, he maintains, difficulties arose from neglecting a broad 
class of other phenomena.  "My discovery was serendipitous," he 
recalls.  "I'd been wrestling with various theories for weeks 
without getting anywhere.  Finally, in my office, I picked up 
Merzbacher's Quantum Mechanics in one hand and Misner, Thorne and 
Wheeler's Gravitation in the other--well, I touched it, anyway, 
it's too heavy to lift.  Just as I was staring at both of them, my 
Scrabble set fell from the top shelf and hit me on the head." 
<P>
With the blow came illumination.  If one merely assumes that 
Scrabble must exist, the rest of nature follows.  Gravity, for 
example, is necessary to keep the pieces on the board. 
Electromagnetism provides light, to see the letters with.  One 
critic pointed out the possibility of magnetized pieces; Woozy 
pondered for hours until he had resolved the conflict to his 
satisfaction. 
<P>
"One not only needs gravity to keep the pieces on the board," he 
explained, "but also to provide an atmosphere, so the players can 
breathe."  When the critic began to suggest pressure suits and 
space colonies, Woozy silenced him with a skillfully thrown 
paperweight. 
<P>
"I take my work seriously," he declared. 
<P>
Most exciting of all, Woozy theory provides the first coherent 
explanation for the universe as a whole.  If Scrabble is necessary, 
then so are players, and a universe to play in.  Woozy calls this the 
"Really Strong" or "Scrabble" Anthropic Principle.  Humans (or at 
least intelligent beings) are necessary, providing an order to 
biological evolution which has been lacking since the failure of the 
Chain of Being.  This also suggests that if aliens exist, they may 
well play Scrabble. 
<P>
"That doesn't mean that they will speak English, necessarily," 
Woozy added cautiously.  "There are foreign language versions, 
after all.  And the point values may differ, somewhat."  He 
suggested to SETI that they listen for very long range Play By Mail 
games.  At present, his suggestion has not been acted on. 
"They're just miffed that they didn't think of it," Woozy 
sniffed. 
<P>
Rival theories include unifying QFT and GR with chess or 
checkers, or even tic-tac-toe.  While the originators of these 
theories remain hopeful, Woozy is pessimistic. 
<P>
"Those games are extremely difficult to unify with Quantum 
Mechanics," Woozy explained, "since they lack an element of chance. 
And tic-tac-toe doesn't even have pieces, so gravity is pretty 
shaky as well.  Plus it's a drawn game (no pun intended).  Who'd 
want to live in a universe that boring?"  Woozy also recalled an 
early game of quantum chess:  "After about thirty moves, black was 
both mated and not mated.  It made for terrible arguments." 
<P>
Are these, or similar theories, the answer to the riddle of the 
universe?  Most observers doubt it.  Still, as Dr. Woozy himself 
points out, "What the heck, it keeps us off the streets."
