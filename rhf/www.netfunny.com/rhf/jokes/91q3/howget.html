This was part of a set of stories over in another group.  This one 
was rather funny...  (it came from Tension City) 
<P>
A friend told me the following about a conversation with her four-year old: 
<P>
A TV show for children, involving dinosaurs, had a bit where the dinos were 
wondering whether or not an egg would hatch, and did the dinosaur parents 
want a baby or not? 
<P>
Tyke: "Sometimes you get babies when you don't want them." 
<P>
Mom: "Yes, that's true.  But we really wanted you." 
<P>
Tyke: [Silence for a moment.]  "Did Daddy have to cut you open to put his 
seed in you?" 
<P>
(The topic having already been discussed in the past.) 
<P>
Mom:  [Dreading the sudden direction the conversation had taken.] "No..." 
<P>
Tyke:  "Then <B>how</B> did he get the seed in?" 
<P>
Mom:  "Uh, he just did." 
<P>
Tyke:  "But *how*?" 
<P>
Mom: "Do you <B>really</B> want to know?" 
<P>
Tyke:  "YES!!!" 
<P>
Mom: [Resigned to it, now] "Well, Daddy put his penis in my vagina." 
<P>
Tyke: [Very wide eyes]  "He DID???" 
<P>
Mom:  "Yes..." 
<P>
Tyke:  "But how did he get his <B>big huge penis</B> into your vagina?!" 
<P>
Mom: [to Dad]  "Um, would you help me out a little bit here, dear?" 
<P>
Dad:  [pauses, looks intently at Tyke]  "Honey--these are *excellent* 
questions you're asking!" 
<P>
Tyke:  "How did he get it in?" 
<P>
Mom:  "Well, it just fit." 
<P>
Tyke: [Digests this for a moment]  "So, did it feel good?" 
<P>
Mom: [Too amused for embarrassment by now] "Yes, dear, actually it did." 
<P>
Tyke:  "Oh." 
<P>
End of discussion.  Tyke's interrogative style was likened to that of an 
especially tenacious attorney conducting cross-examination. 
<P>
The next morning Tyke was overheard intently propounding her new knowledge to 
her two-year old sister. 
<P>
Kids have this way of getting right to the heart of the matter, huh? 
<P>
