Here's a hypothetical situation: 
<P>
I drove home late last night and drove over the neighbour's 
cat.  What should I do? 
<P>
(a) hide the cat and let them think it ran away? 
<P>
(b) wedge the cat under the neighbor's tire so they think 
they did it? 
<P>
(c) paint a hexagram on their front lawn and put the cat 
in the middle so they think that crazy Satanists did it? 
<P>
(d) throw the cat into my other neighbour's yard? 
<P>
(e) tell them that the cat will come back? 
<P>
(f) claim that I had the right of way and the cat 
had no business running in front of the car when it 
obviously knew I was going to accelerate? 
<P>
(g) put the cat in the garborator so there isn't any 
evidence? 
<P>
(h) put the cat in a tree,  call the fire department 
and let them try to explain it? 
<P>
(i) explain that when cats get to a certain age 
they just lie around a lot and smell bad? 
<P>
(j) tell them that I ran over their cat with my car? 
<P>
(l) move away? 
<P>
(m) buy them a new cat that looks exactly like it? 
<P>
(n) drive over the rest of the cat's in the neighbourhood 
and claim that I was on a mission from god? 
<P>
(r) send them a bill for services rendered? 
<P>
(t) have the cat stuffed and put it on their front 
lawn so they won't notice a thing? 
<P>
(u) mail it to them so they blame it on the postal 
service? 
<P>
(v) blow it up? 
<P>
(w) say that I saw space aliens land a flying saucer 
on top of it just before they got out and took 
my socks? 
<P>
(x) I don't know? 
<P>
(y) why not? 
<P>
(z) claim a heard of African zebras stampeded 
my car causing me to swerve and hit the cat? 
<P>
