<STRONG>[Ed: This is a variant of a joke that went before.  That's something I 
do not usually do.  In this case, the punchline is sufficiently different.]</STRONG> 
<P>
My girlfriend told me this one: 
<P>
Pres. Bush, (NY) Gov. Cuomo, and (NJ) Gov. Florio are flying on 
a plane together.  When they passed over New York, Cuomo wrote his 
name on two one dollar bills and threw them from the plane.  Florio 
very curious about this action asked him why he had done it.  Cuomo 
responded that he had just won two votes. 
<P>
Florio, not wishing to be outdone, wrote his name on two one hundred 
dollar bills and threw them from the plane once they reached New Jersey. 
This caught the attention of President Bush, who inquired about this 
action.  Florio explained about just winning two votes. 
<P>
A few minutes later, Pres. Bush shoved both Cuomo and Florio from 
the plane.  The pilot was shocked and asked the President why in the 
world he just killed two Governors.  The President responded, 
"Simple, I just won two states." 
<P>
