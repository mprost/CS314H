<P>
X-RAY SPECS 
<P>
Forget the cheap, plastic x-ray specs from yesteryear.  These battery powered 
spectacles contain a real x-ray!  Hold your hand in front of your face to 
see your bones wiggling around.  Count your friends' vertebrae and locate 
joint articulations.  Great at lab parties! 
<P>
$11.99 each 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
LEONARD THE TALKING LAB MOUSE 
<P>
Turn Leonard on and he occasionally twitches in his cage.  Pick him up by 
his tail and he says, ``Hey, put me down!''  Covered with real mouse fur, 
Leonard is the most realistic looking ersatz mouse on the market. 
<P>
$14.99 each 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
REMOTE-CONTROLLED GEIGER COUNTER 
<P>
Looks and acts like a real Geiger counter but you can make the needle 
``jump'' at the press of a button.  Hide the remote control in your pocket 
and make the needle move when people check themselves for radiation.  They'll 
go into hysterics thinking they have received a lethal dose!  Yuks galore! 
<P>
$259.99 each 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
GLOW-IN-THE-DARK PIPETTE TIPS 
<P>
You will be the talk of the lab with these handy glow-in-the-dark pipette 
tips.  They fit standard 20, 200, and 1000 microliter pipetmen. 
<P>
$19.49 for bulk bag of 1000 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
SNAKE-IN-A-REAGENT-JAR 
<P>
Three spring snakes fit into our realistic chemical reagent jar.  People 
expecting to weigh out chemicals will be ``attacked'' by the snakes!  A 
laugh riot! 
<P>
$4.99 for reagent jar and three snakes 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
CENTRIFUGE NOISES 
<P>
This mini tape recorder fits behind any standard ultracentrifuge.  As the 
centrifuge accelerates, the mini recorder makes incredibly loud scraping 
sounds to simulate the rotor becoming unbalanced.  Watch them run for cover 
as they think the rotor is about to go through the wall! 
<P>
$13.99 each 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
THE SPILLED EXPERIMENT GAG 
<P>
Based on the old ``spilled beer gag'', an Erlenmeyer flask is tipped on its 
side with the ``contents'' spilling out.  The ``liquid'' is really a 
transparent, solid plastic but only you will know that.  Perfect for 
dealing with neatness nuts in the lab. 
<P>
$4.99 each 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
DRIBBLE BEAKER 
<P>
Looks like a real beaker but when the researcher pours out any fluid, it 
dribbles down the side!  More fun than a barrel of monkeys! 
<P>
$5.99 each 
<P>
