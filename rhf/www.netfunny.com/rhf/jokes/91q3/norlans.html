<PRE>The following bulletin was composed by Sonia Bot with some (small) help
from myself.  The events depicted below are TRUE.  I have eliminated
the hotel name so as not to be involved in legal hassles.

bulletin:

from:        Sonia  Bot and Diane MacMartin

subject:     Travel Tips


      As some of you may already know, Diane MacMartin and I attended
the Computer Human Interaction (CHI) Conference in New Orleans last
week.  Diane and I agreed to cut costs by being room mates, booking
great seat sales, and diet on granola bars.  Our trip was an adventure
that we'll certainly never forget!  Although it was very successful, we
thought it would be wise to pass on some tips for business travel...

      So, if you ever find yourself in any of the following situations,
just keep your composure and think...

Situation                            What to do...
---------                            -------------
You arrive in New Orleans and        Simply ignore the bordello.  Find

and don't see any balconies...

jazz band playing on the plane...


      Although we are being humourous, we'd like to remind you that when
on business travel, things may not always go smoothly.  You may recall
the numerous incidents in Toronto's hotels last year, where someone
would pose as hotel staff, and lure guests to opening their doors, only
to attack them.  Just remember, never open your hotel room door unless
you are absolutely sure who is on the other side.

      You may wonder why we didn't check out of our hotel after our
first incident.  Short of finding a safe alley and living out of our
car, we could not find any other accommodations in the city since
there were no vacancies due to other conferences and the Jazz and
Heritage Festival.  I found myself in a similar situation in Halifax
a few years ago when I presented a paper at a Medical and Biological
Engineering conference.

      Keeping your head on straight and approaching these situations
with good humour will help make the trip a successful and enjoyable one.
We did this, and we'll fondly remember this trip as an adventure.  But,
we must admit, we did get on our knees and kiss the ground when we
arrived in Ottawa!

P.S.  We did make an appearance at the CHI conference!  Stay tuned
      for our technical trip reports...

P.S.  Do not stay at the xxxxxxxx Hotel in the New Orleans suburb of
      Metairie) even if it is an official hotel for the conference
      you are attending.
