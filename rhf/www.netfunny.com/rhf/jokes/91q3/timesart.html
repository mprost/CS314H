The following appeared as an "Editors' Note" in the <I>New York 
Times</I>, July 11, 1991: 
<P>
An article on July 3 described a controversy involving allegations of 
plagiarism at Boston University's College of Communication.  In a 
commencement address in May, the dean of the college, H. Joachim 
Maitre, repeated virtually word for word passages from an article by a 
PBS film critic.  In the speech, Mr. Maitre did not acknowledge or 
credit the article. 
<P>
The Times account acknowledged that the controversy had first been 
reported in The Boston Globe on July 2.  But it should also have noted 
that the quotations it cited from Mr. Maitre's speech were taken from 
the Globe article. 
<P>
Besides the quotations from Mr. Maitre's speech, the Times article 
included a passage of five paragraphs that closely resembled five 
paragraphs in the Globe article.  The passage involved comparisons of 
the same sets of quotations from the disputed texts.  Although the 
Times article also reflected independent investigation of the 
controversy and interviews by the Times reporter, it was in this 
instance improperly dependent on the Globe account. 
<P>
