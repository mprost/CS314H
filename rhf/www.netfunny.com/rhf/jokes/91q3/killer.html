MILWAUKEE (UPI)--Law enforcement officials report an ongoing 
investigation into leads linking mass murder suspect Jeffrey Dahmer with 
dozens of unsolved incidents in a score of countries and several 
historical periods. 
<P>
"This case is turning into one of those Russian dolls that you 
just keep finding more dolls inside," says Marshall Perkins, a Milwaukee 
Police Department detective.  "It's not just Wisconsin and Germany. 
Apparently Dahmer really got around." 
<P>
State Department officials visiting Vietnam in quest of 
information concerning American MIAs confirm that Vietnamese authorities 
suspect Dahmer may be the key to the whereabouts of dozens of missing 
servicemen.  "Yes, of course we had American prisoners in the 1970s," 
said Nguyen Gap, mayor of the provincial town of Dong Hoi in northern 
Vietnam.  "Then, about 1980, an American with special papers came 
through, and we never saw the prisoners again."  But farmers outside 
Dong Hoi reported discovering human body parts in rice fields during the 
months that followed. 
Army officials in Washington would neither confirm nor deny 
rumors that Dahmer left Germany for Southeast Asia on special assignment 
during his military service eleven years ago. 
<P>
Cattle ranchers in Montana believe Dahmer may be the missing 
piece to the bizarre jigsaw puzzle of livestock deaths that splashed 
across tabloid newspapers in the early 1980s, when a number of steers 
were discovered dead on the range, their throats slit and their bodies 
often mutilated.  While ranchers blamed everything from Satanists to 
space aliens, Milwaukee sources confirm that Dahmer has admitted to 
murdering the steers during two summers he spent working as a janitor in 
Yellowstone National Park.  "He'd go off on the weekends in his pickup 
and look for strays," said an informant from the District Attorney's 
office.  "He'd lure them with alfalfa, hit them with a tranquilizer 
dart, and cut their throat with a Bowie knife." 
<P>
Two co-workers at the Old Faithful Inn yesterday recalled 
finding several bloody, hastily wrapped beef hearts in one of the kitchen 
refrigerators there.  "Dahmer told us he'd made a run to a butcher shop 
down in Jackson, but we always kind of wondered," said Harry Strassen, 
34.  "Now we know." 
<P>
Milwaukee officials have installed a special phone line to 
handle dozens of inquiries pouring into City Hall from all over the 
globe.  "It's unbelievable.  Voodoo killings in Haiti, necklacings in 
South Africa, crop circles in England," says Patti Sherlock, 23, 
administrative assistant at City Hall.  "If there were a Nobel Prize for 
mass murder this guy would get it." 
<P>
"Actually," she mused, "I can kind of sleep easier now, knowing 
that so much of all these scary things goes back to one guy.  And he's 
locked up.  I hope they throw away the key."

Morbid humour: 
<P>
Here are some excerpts from a conversation I had about the Milwaukee cannibal... 
<P>
Did you know the Milwaukee cannibal was let out on bail today? I heard it 
cost him an arm and a leg. 
<P>
Apparently he told the police he used to work in a candy factory... Imagine 
that!   I'll never eat Hershey again. 
And when questioned by the police as to why he did it, he apparently said: 
"Sometimes you feel nutty. Sometimes you don't!" 
<P>
He's believed to have killed people while he was in Germany... guess he took 
the "Get a taste of Europe tour" too literally.

They've added a new charge to those against Jeffrey Dahmer after investigating 
his European contacts more closely.
