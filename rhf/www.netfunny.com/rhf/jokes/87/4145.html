There were these two horses standing at the bar. One said to the 
other "how ya doin?"...other replied, "not so good...the other day 
I was in a race and there were so many GREAT horses and jockeys I 
figured 'screw it', I ain't runnin' this race and all of a sudden 
WHOOSH! UP MY ASS! and I won by a head." 
<P>
The other horse said, "no kiddin' 
yesterday I was in a race and the same thing...I figured 'screw it', I 
ain't runnin' and half way around the track...WHOOSH! UP MY ASS! and I 
won!" 
<P>
This greyhound walks up to the two horses and says, "'scuse me 
but I couldn't help but overhear you guys. Just today I was in a race 
and there were so many great dogs I figured 'screw it' I ain't 
runnin' in this race. All of a sudden WHOOSH! UP MY ASS! and I won by a 
length!! 
<P>
One horse looked at the other and said, "WELL FUCK ME, A 
TALKIN' DOG!!!"
