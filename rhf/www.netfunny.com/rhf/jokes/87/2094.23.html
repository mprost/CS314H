<CENTER>PUT MORE STRESS INTO YOUR LIFE!</CENTER><BR>
<P>
Refuse to take action on nagging problems. Procrastinate,  brood, 
and if possible, lose some sleep over them. 
<P>
Make a concerted effort to take note of irritations in your  life 
and blow them out of proportion. 
<P>
Consider the power of negative thinking. 
<P>
Hide your sense of humour. Erase the words smile, joke, and laugh 
from your vocabulary; concentrate on frowning. 
<P>
If you've been working a 60 hour  week,  try  65  or  70  or  75! 
Spending  more  time  at work will give you less time to consider 
how stressed you are. 
<P>
Consume vast quantities of  caffeine.  As  a  stimulant  it  will 
ensure that you are awake day and night. 
<P>
Practice the art of ``hurry up and wait.'' This means dashing off 
to  join  a  line-up somewhere - like the bank, cinema, or ticket 
outlet. 
<P>
Make sure you drive no further than two  feet  from  the  car  in 
front. 
<P>
To relieve boredom while waiting for traffic lights, pretend  you 
are on the starting grid for the Indy 500. 
<P>
Never read a book or listen to music. 
<P>
Play ``Hide and Seek'' by  concealing  important  documents  from 
yourself. 
<P>
Delegate nagging problems. You've proved that you can't deal with 
them. 
<P>
Tell yourself that your abilities are unlimited.  Do  not  waver 
from this conviction until you are fired for lack of competence. 
<P>
Giggle nervously. It will make  other  people  nervous,  meetings 
will  be unproductive and you won't come away with a long list of 
things to do. 
<P>
Find a disagreeable tennis partner. Perhaps your spouse. 
<P>
When feeling stressful, breathe deeply and hyperventilate  until 
you pass out. 
<P>
Take up gardening. Nothing can be more  stressful  if  you  don't 
like it. 
<P>
When things are going badly, knock your head  against  the  wall. 
The resulting headache will supersede the original problem. 
<P>
