(I'll get one of these on yet!!)  

	A man and his wife were going to spend their honeymoon
night at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C.  Upon arriving
at their room, the woman got quite anxious and excited about 
spending the night in the very room that was involved in the
scandal.  The husband, however, was unaware of the significance
of the hotel, and was rather calm.  When they got ready to
go to bed the woman said, "Honey, I don't know about this."
	"What's the matter, dear?" he said.
	"Well, don't you feel a bit nervous about staying
in the very room that was involved in the Watergate Scandal?
I mean, what if someone is listening in on everything that
we are saying or doing?"
	The man was surprised to learn this, but expressed
no uneasiness to the whole deal.  But new bride couldn't get
herself to relax and finally the husband said, "Would it make
you feel any better if I looked around the room for bugs?"
She agreed that it would.  So the husband searched high and low,
looking in the bathroom, the sink, the cabinet, behind pictures,
in lampshades, and even in the phone only to find nothing.
As a last idea, he checked under the big rug in the center of the
room.  To his surprise, he found a small, black, metallic object
in the floor!  Deciding that it could in fact be a bug, he got
a screwdriver, pried the thing up from the floor, and flushed
it down the toilet.  "Now do you feel better, dear?" he asked.
"Yes," she said. "Thank you."
	Moments later, the phone rang.  Exchanging nervous glances
with his wife, the man picked it up.  It was the front desk and the
clerk asked, "Are you two all right up there?"
	"Of course," replied the man.  "Why do you ask?"

	"Well," he replied, "the people below you just
had a chandelier fall into the middle of their room!"
