<P>
A communist party official opened a whorehouse to attract tourists 
and their foreign currency.  Adding up his books after a year, 
he discovered he had lost a great deal of money. 
<P>
"I don't understand it," he moaned.  "I hired all the best girls. 
Why, every single one of them has been a good loyal party member 
for at least 30 years!" 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
An elderly man stands in line for hours at a Warsaw meat store (meat 
is severely rationed).  When the butcher comes out at the end of 
the day and announces that there is no meat left, the man flies into 
a rage. 
<P>
"What is this?" he shouts.  "I fought against the Nazis, I worked 
hard all my life, I've been a loyal citizen, and now you tell me I 
can't even buy a piece of meat?  This rotten system stinks!" 
<P>
Suddenly a thuggish man in a black leather coat sidles up and murmurs 
"Take it easy, comrade.  Remember what would have happened if you 
had made an outburst like that only a few years ago"--and he points 
an imaginary gun to his head and pulls the trigger. 
<P>
The old man goes home, and his wife says, "So they're out of 
meat again?" 
<P>
"It's worse than that," he replies.  "They're out of bullets."
