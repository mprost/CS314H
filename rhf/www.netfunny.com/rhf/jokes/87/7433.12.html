(Well, since there seems to be a plethora of Soviet jokes anyway... 
This one was told to me by a Russian.) 
<P>
It seems that Reagan and Gorbachev arranged a competition to determine 
whose nation had the bravest troops.  The two leaders arrived, at the 
designated hour, on a plateau in Finland high above the water.  Each 
was accompanied by a battalion of crack troops, smartly uniformed. 
The leaders shook hands. 
<P>
Reagan went first.  He addressed his battalion of Marines: 
<P>
"Private Jones!  Front and center." 
<P>
Private Jones saluted and briskly marched to the front of the ranks, 
facing his commander. 
<P>
"Private Jones!  March to the edge of the cliff." 
<P>
Private Jones saluted and briskly marched to the very edge of the cliff. 
<P>
"Private Jones!  Jump!" 
<P>
Jones just stood there, unmoving. 
<P>
"Private Jones!  I said jump!" 
<P>
The man's knees started to shake, but he was otherwise motionless. 
<P>
"Private Jones!  This is your Commander-in-Chief.  I ORDER YOU TO JUMP!!!" 
Private Jones wailed out:  "I can't!  I have a wife--and a family!" 
<P>
The MPs arrived and escorted Jones away for court martial.  Reagan 
backed off in disgrace.  It was now Gorbachev's turn. 
<P>
"Comrade Dmitrivich!  Front and center." 
<P>
Comrade Dmitrivich saluted and briskly marched to the front of the 
ranks, facing his commander. 
<P>
"Comrade Dmitrivich!  March to the edge of the cliff." 
<P>
Dmitrivich saluted and briskly marched to the very edge of the cliff. 
<P>
"Comrade Dmitrivich!  Jump!" 
<P>
Dmitrivich jumped off the cliff. 
<P>
By some miracle, he is snagged on a branch and he lands on a crag 
some 50 feet below the top of the cliff.  Dmitrivich is badly injured, 
but still alive and conscious.  He is carried away on a stretcher. 
<P>
As Dmitrivich is carried passed Private Jones, Jones cannot resist 
asking him: 
<P>
"Dmitrivich!  How could you do it?  How could you jump?" 
<P>
Dmitrivich answered: "I had to!  I have a wife--and a family!"
