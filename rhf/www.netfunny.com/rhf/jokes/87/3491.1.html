Late-breaking news: Federal investigators have revealed that yesterday's 
record drop in the stock market was apparently triggered by two 
high-school students operating out of a basement somewhere in Western 
Pennsylvania.  The names of the suspects, both minors, have not been 
released.  Arrest warrants have allegedly been issued, but the student 
hackers apparently have not yet been apprehended.  A spokesman for the 
FBI refused to comment on the rumor that the two had managed to leave 
the country carrying millions of dollars in cash and gold. 
<P>
Just after the close of stock trading on Monday, the Washington Post 
received a call from two individuals who claimed to be the stock market 
"hackers."  The callers explained that they have been breaking into the 
computer systems of major brokerage houses for several months, 
"adjusting" the price of various stocks.  This was done by telephone, 
using a Macintosh personal computer and, later, a Perq workstation that 
the pair had retrieved from a dumpster at CMU.  The callers claim that 
they finally "cracked" security on the New York Stock Exchange's new 
supercomputer about two weeks ago. 
<P>
"It was ridiculously easy," said one of the hackers, who identified 
himself only as "Captain Weenie."  "The password was `Scrooge'.  What 
turkeys!  After we bounced a few stocks, they got suspicious and changed 
the password, but it was too late.  We had Trojan horses planted all 
over that system by the time they got wind of us.  We were just playing 
around, trying to keep ahead of them, and making some pocket money on 
the side.  We had a big pile of gold hidden in this hollow tree.  We 
joked about buying a Cray with it, but we didn't have enough yet.  You 
can't just buy the machine and put it in the basement, and my mother 
would have been pretty suspicious if we put up a big air-conditioned 
building in the back yard.  The projection TV was bad enough--we told 
her we did some programming for the guy who owned the store.  Anyway, 
today the (expletive deleted) Perq went crazy and we decided that we had 
better go underground in a hurry." 
<P>
The two went on to explain that the record-breaking plunge in stock 
prices was triggered unintentionally when faulty floating-point 
microcode on the Perq put the machine into an infinite loop in the 
middle of a routine that selected a stock at random and issued bogus 
"sell" orders.  By the time the machine's plug was pulled, nervous 
investors had noticed the dramatic downward trend and had begun to sell 
off their own holdings.  "The market was probably going to crash 
anyway," one of the callers claimed, "but I wish they had debugged that 
microcode." 
<P>
Professor Douglas Tygar of Carnegie-Mellon University, an expert on 
computer security, has been summoned to the White House for urgent 
consultation on how such break-ins can be prevented in the future.  As 
he was boarding the private jet at Greater Pittsburgh Airport, Tygar was 
heard to comment that the root password for the stock exchange's main 
computer should have been at least eight characters long, and probably 
should not have been the name of a comic book character.  Tygar denied 
rumors that he had accepted the post of Secretary of the Treasury, 
claiming that he would rather be director of the National Security 
Agency.
