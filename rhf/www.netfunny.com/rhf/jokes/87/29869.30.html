(Brad, granted this is old, but I hadn't heard it in a while and smirked at it:) 
<P>
A farmer decides that his 3 sows should be bred, and contacts his buddy 
down the road, who owns 3 male pigs.  They agree on a stud fee, and the 
farmer puts the sows in his pickup and brings them down the road to the 
males.  He leaves them all day, and when he picks them up that night, asks 
the man how he can tell if it 'took' or not.  The breeder replies that 
if, the next morning, the sows were grazing on grass, they were pregnant, 
but if they were rolling in the mud as usual, they probably weren't ... 
<P>
Comes the morn, the sows are rolling in the mud as usual, so the farmer 
puts them in the truck and brings them back for a second full day of 
frolic.  This continues for a week, since each morning the sows are 
rolling in the mud. 
<P>
About the sixth day, the farmer wakes up and tells his wife, "I don't 
have the heart to look again.  This is getting ridiculous, AND expensive. 
You check today."  With that, the wife peeks out the bedroom window and 
starts to laugh. 
<P>
"What is it?" asks the farmer excitedly.  "Are they grazing at last?" 
<P>
"Nope." says the wife.  "Two of them are jumping up and down in the back 
of your truck, and the other one is honking the horn!"
