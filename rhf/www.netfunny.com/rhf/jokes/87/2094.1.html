...about the doctor, engineer, and programmer who were debating what the 
world's oldest profession was (other than the obvious one)?  The doctor 
said that medicine was the oldest because the Lord performed surgery in 
the removal of Adam's rib.  The engineer countered that before that act, 
the Lord had performed feats of engineering by creating the earth and 
heavens from nothing. 
<P>
The doctor conceded that the engineer was right and that engineering was 
indeed the oldest profession.  But then the programmer interjected that 
programming was even older.  He was chided by both the doctor and the 
engineer saying that engineering had to be the oldest, because before the 
Lord engineered the earth and heavens, there was nothing, only the Great 
Void, only Chaos! 
<P>
The programmer simply smiled and said: 
<P>
"Where do you think the Chaos came from?"
