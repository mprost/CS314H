A telphone man joined  the  Army.   As  part  of  his  basic 
training,  he  went out on the rifle range.  He fired 99 shots at 
the target, and missed the target with  every  shot!   His  Drill 
Instructor tried to find out why. 
<P>
"What's the matter with you?" asked the DI.  "Why can't you 
hit the target?  What were you in civilian life?" 
<P>
"I was a telephone man," replied the  new  recruit,  "and  I 
don't know why I can't hit the target.  Let me see..." 
<P>
The telephone man  checked  his  rifle,  checked  his  rifle 
again,  and  checked  his  rifle  a  third time.  He then put his 
finger in front of the muzzle, pulled the trigger, and  blew  the 
end of his finger off! 
<P>
"Well," the phone man said, writhing in pain,  "the  bullets 
are leaving here fine.  The trouble must be on the other end!"
