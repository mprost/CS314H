This is a story about Johnnie's day at school....Johnnie's teacher got up 
in front of the class and announced they were going to play a guessing 
game!  The teacher said, "I have something behind my back.  It's red in 
color and round.  It's soft, but it's hard." 
<P>
Johnnie raised his hand and 
said, "Teacher, I know it's a red rubber ball."  The teacher said, "No 
Johnnie, it's an apple, but I like the way that you think." 
<P>
Next the 
teacher grabbed another object and put it behind her back.  "I have 
something behind my back.  It's orange in color and round.  It's soft, 
but it's hard," said Johnnie's teacher. 
<P>
Johnnie raised his hand again 
and said, "Teacher, teacher, I know it's an orange rubber ball."  The 
teacher looked at Johnnie and said, "No Johnnie, it's an orange, but I 
like the way that you think." 
<P>
Johnnie was now getting the hang of it so 
he asked the teacher if he could try one.  Johnnie grabbed an object and 
put it behind his back and said, "I have something behind my back.  It's 
pink in color and it's LONG.  It's soft, but it's HARD." 
<P>
The teacher, 
getting upset, yelled at Johnnie, "Now Johnnie, I'm going to have to tell 
the principal about this perverted behavior."  Johnnie stopped her and 
said, "But, teacher all I have is my pink eraser, but I like the way 
that you THINK!!!"
