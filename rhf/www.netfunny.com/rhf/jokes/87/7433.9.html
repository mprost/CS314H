The line in front of the Butcher shop in Warsaw is long, 
indeed, and the people grow weary, ever more weary, of the wait. 
Eventually an official comes out and announces "We are very low 
on meat; all Jews must leave the line." So the Jews in the line 
quit the queue and head for home, empty-handed. 
<P>
After some more of a wait the same official reappears 
and announces, "We are even lower on meat that we thought. All 
non-party members must leave the line." So all the non-card-carrying 
members standing in line begin heading for home, equally empty-handed. 
<P>
After some more time the official appears to declare "All 
Serbs and Croats must leave the line; we haven't enough meat for 
you." Disappointed, they leave the line and wander off. 
<P>
Well, you guessed it: a bit later the same official appears 
and informs the remaining people "Unfortunately we have run out of 
meat entirely - you may as well <I>all</I> go home," and disappears back 
into the store. 
<P>
"Isn't that just the way it always is," mutters one old man 
as he departs. "Those damn Jews get all the breaks!" 
<P>
