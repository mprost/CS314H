(I've been making a collection of people's mis-rememberences of movie 
titles and making up descriptions of what the movies would be like if 
they really existed.  Here are a few examples:) 
<P>
8 1/2 WEEKS--Considered by some to be Fellini's masterpiece. 
A filmmaker is resting at a health spa and trying to write a new movie. 
He is distracted, however, by his visions of whips, strawberries, and 
a mysterious woman in white. 
<P>
NATIONAL BLUE VELVET--Elizabeth Taylor plays a young woman 
with a strange attraction to horses.  Dennis Hopper plays the wacky, 
demented jockey. 
<P>
MIRACLE ON 42ND STREET--Santa Claus, in the off season, follows 
his heart's desire and tries to make it big on Broadway.  Santa 
sings and dances his way into your heart. 
<P>
COLOR ME PURPLE--Whoopi Goldberg was nominated for an 
Academy Award (tm) for her part as a carnival face painter. 
<P>
THE JAGGED RAZOR'S EDGE--This was made as a training film 
for pubescent teens who are learning how to shave, but it contains 
so much blood and gore that it is now considered a camp horror 
classic.  Look for the sequels, FACES OF DEATH, LEGS OF DEATH and 
UNDERARMS OF DEATH.
