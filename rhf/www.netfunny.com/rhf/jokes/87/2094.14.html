This cabdriver is having an affair with a married woman. 
So they're making love in the afternoon while the husband is supposedly 
at work, when suddenly a car pulls up in the driveway.  The woman 
exclaims, "Oh my god!  My husband is home early!  You have to get out 
of here, he's a weightlifter and he'll break every bone in your body!" 
<P>
Well, the cabdriver is terrified and runs out of the bedroom.  A moment 
later the husband comes bursting into the room, yelling, "All right, 
I know you've been fooling around, where is he?"  As he's running around 
the house looking for the guy, through the kitchen window he sees a 
cab driving away.  He's so angry he picks up the refrigerator and 
hurls it out the window at the cab!  Unfortunately, he misses, and 
even more unfortunately, he suffers a triple hernia and dies on the 
spot. 
<P>
The next thing he knows he's standing in line, waiting to get into heaven. 
When he gets to the front of the line, St. Peter asks him how he died, 
he explains, and he is admitted.  "Next, please," says St. Peter.  "And 
how did you die, sir?" 
<P>
"Well," says the cabbie, "I was hiding in this refrigerator when ..."
