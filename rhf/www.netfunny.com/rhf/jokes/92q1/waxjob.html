<PRE>I've been touting this one around for a couple of years.  I can't remember
the source:

A guy goes by the whorehouse - he's pretty desperate, but low on cash. After some
haggling, the old-pro at the door finally gives in and suggests that Martha 
upstairs might give him a good time,  and leaves him with the words, 
"and be sure to ask her for a wax-job!".

So he trots expectantly upstairs and knocks at Martha's boudoir.  She greets 
him and when he tells her he's come for a "wax-job" she becomes soft and 
welcoming.  She undresses him carefully and leads him to the window, which she 
raises with a heave. She whispers sweet nothings and lays his meat on the 
window-sill.  Suddenly she SLAMS the window down on his ding-dong - at which
moment two small wads of wax are seen to shoot out of his ears.
