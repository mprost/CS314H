<PRE>Heard at the bowling alley last night.

A priest and nun are on their way back home from a convention when their
car breaks down.  They are unable to get repairs completed and it appears
that they will have to spend the night in a motel.

The only motel in this town has only one room available so they have a
minor problem.

PREIST:  Sister, I don't think the Lord would have a problem, under the
circumstances, if we spent the night together in this one room.  I'll
sleep on the couch and you take the bed.

SISTER:  I think that would be okay.

They prepare for bed and each one takes their agreed place in the room.
Ten minutes later...

SISTER:  Father, I'm terribly cold.

PRIEST:  Okay, I'll get up and get you a blanket from the closet.

Ten minutes later...

SISTER:  Father, I'm still terribly cold.

PRIEST:  Okay Sister, I'll get up and get you another blanket.

Ten minutes later...

SISTER:  Father, I'm still terribly cold.  I don't think the Lord would
mind if we acted as man and wife just for this one night.

PRIEST:  You're probably right...........Get up and get your own damn
blanket.
