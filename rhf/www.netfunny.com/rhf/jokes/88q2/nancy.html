One morning, President Reagan woke up to a beautiful snowy noon. He 
looked out of his window upon the snow-covered White House lawn and 
marveled at its beauty. Then he noticed something. Yellow lines in 
the snow. On further investigation, our President realized that the 
lines spelled out "Reagan Sucks" in urine. Furious, he called the 
Washington, DC police and demanded to know who had inscribed these 
blasphemous words on his lawn. After a lengthy investigation, the 
police found no clues. 
<P>
Later that afternoon, after a brief snowfall, the president awoke 
again to find the same words once more decorating the new-fallen 
snow. This time, President Ron called the FBI and ordered them to 
find out who was responsible. The FBI too mounted a massive 
investigation, but were only able to determine that no intruder had 
access to the White House lawn and therefore the perpetrator had to 
be someone on his own staff. 
<P>
When the next day, the same insults were discovered on a new blanket 
of snow, Old Ron decided to leave no stone unturned. He asked the 
entire US military to get to the bottom of this conspiracy. By 
dinnertime, the Secretary of Defense had some bad news for Mr. 
Reagan. 
<P>
"I'm afraid," he said, "that the urine sample come from none other 
than the Secretary of State, George Schultz." 
<P>
"This is terrible," said the president. 
<P>
"I'm afraid I have more bad news," said the secretary. 
<P>
"What could be worse," said Reagan, "than finding out that George, 
the only member of my administration not to be involved in a 
scandal, is involved in this conspiracy?" 
<P>
"Well, you see Mr. President, it was written in Nancy's handwriting."
