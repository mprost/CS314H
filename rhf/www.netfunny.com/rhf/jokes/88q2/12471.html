First a short one: 
<P>
Q:  How do you get a nun pregnant? 
<P>
A:  You fuck her. 
<P>
<STRONG>[Ed: I suspect most people have heard that one. ]</STRONG> 
<P>
<HR>
Now a rather long one: 
<P>
A guy gets on a bus and notices a nun sitting over in 
a corner.  Through her heavy head piece he just spots a glimmer 
of her face.  Gorgeous!  She moves, and her vestments cannot 
hide the fact she has a truly phenomenal body.  The guy gets 
more and more excited until he finally approaches the nun and 
tells "Sister, I don't normally do this sort of thing, but I 
think I love you.  Can we get together some time?" 
<P>
The nun leaves the bus in a huff. 
<P>
Later as the guy is about to leave the bus himself, the bus 
driver asks the guy if he was the one who was bothering the 
nun.  The guy again apologizes, explaining once again that 
he seldom did this sort of thing, but the bus driver says: 
"No, don't apologize, I was checking her out myself.  In 
fact, let me do you a favour.  Did you see where she got 
off?  There's a little park there, and every day she goes 
there to pray at the same time.  Go there tomorrow, and maybe....." 
<P>
The guy thanks him and leaves. 
<P>
Sure enough, the guy goes to the park and there's the little 
nun in a secluded spot by some trees.  He goes off into the 
bushes, and comes back a few minutes later in a long white 
robe, a long blond wig with beard and a crown of thorns. 
The nun is flabbergasted, and asks what she can do for him. 
He says that every couple of thousand years, he likes to 
come back to earth to get laid.  The nun says that she'd 
love to help him, but that she was on her period, and 
would the back door be OK? 
<P>
He says fine, and they commence their activities. 
<P>
A few minutes into it, he is suddenly overcome with a blast 
of guilt, and says, panting, "Sister, I have to tell you 
something.  I'm not really Jesus, I'm actually the guy 
who was annoying you on the bus yesterday. 
<P>
The nun says, "Oh, that's OK.  In fact, I'm not really 
a nun.  I'm actually the bus driver." 
<P>
