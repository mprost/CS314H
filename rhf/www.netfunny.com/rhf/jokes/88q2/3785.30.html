<PRE>
 The Ultimate Computer stood as the end of the Ultimate 
Computer Company's production line.
 At which point the guided tour eventually arrived.
 The Salesman stepped forward to give his prepared patter.
 "This," he said, "is the Ultimate Computer. It will give 
an intelligent answer to any question you may care to ask 
it."
 At which Clever Dick stepped forward - there is always 
one - and spoke into the Ultimate Computer's microphone.
 "Where is my father ?" he asked.
 There was a whirring of wheels and flashing of lights 
that the manufacturers always use to impress lay people, 
and then a little card popped out.
 On it were printed the words "Fishing off Florida."
 Clever Dick laughed.
 "Actually," he said, "my father is dead."
It had been a trick question.
 The salesman, carefully chosen for his ability to think fast 
on his feet, immediately replied that he was sorry the 
answer was unsatisfactory, but as computers were precise, 
perhaps he might care to rephrase his question and try 
again ?
 Clever Dick thought, went to the UC and this time said:
 "Where is my mother's husband ?"
 Again there was a whirring of wheels and a flashing of 
lights.
 And again a little card popped out.
 Printed on it were the words:
 "Dead. But your father is still fishing off Florida."

{ed There are, of course, a lot of jokes with this theme. }
