Arthur was sitting outside his local pub one day, enjoying a quiet pint and 
generally feeling good about himself, when a Nun suddenly appears at his 
table and starts decrying the evils of drink. 
<P>
"You should be ashamed of yourself young man!  Drinking is a Sin! Alcohol 
is the blood of the devil!" 
<P>
Now Arthur gets pretty annoyed about this, and goes on the offensive. 
"How do <EM>you</EM> know Sister?" 
<P>
"My Mother Superior told me so." 
<P>
"But have you ever had a drink yourself?  How can you be sure that what you 
are saying is right?" 
<P>
"Don't be ridiculous - of course I have never taken alcohol myself." 
<P>
"Then let me buy you a drink, - if you still believe afterwards that it is 
evil I will give up drink for life." 
<P>
"How could I, a Nun, sit outside this public house drinking?!" 
<P>
"I'll get the barman to put it in a teacup for you, then no one will know." 
<P>
The Nun reluctantly agrees, so Arthur goes inside to the bar. 
<P>
"Another pint for me, and a triple vodka on the rocks," then he lowers his 
voice and says to the barman, "and could you put the vodka in a teacup?" 
<P>
"Oh no!  It's not that bloody Nun again is it?" 
<P>
