An American General, a Russian General and a British General are standing on 
the deck of a ship watching war exercises. (OK, OK, so this is an old one..) 
The topic of discussion turns to human courage, and the Russian General boasts, 
"Russians are the most courageous people on Earth!" 
<P>
Upon which the American (naturally) challenges him: "Oh YEAH?" 
<P>
The Russian says, "Sure! Here, Yuri! Jump off the deck (into the freezing 
Atlantic) and swim around the ship!" 
<P>
Yuri marches off without a word, and does as he is told. The Russian turns 
around and says: "See, there's an example of courage!" 
<P>
The American <EM>has</EM> to top this, so he calls up one of his underlings and gives 
him the order: 
<P>
"Jack, Jump off the main mast into the ocean, and swim around the ship 
seven times!" 
<P>
Poor Jack goes off without a murmur, and he too does as he is told. The 
American General says: "Now top <EM>that</EM> for courage!" 
<P>
So they both turn around to the British General who has been standing around 
watching these antics silently. They ask him: "What about <EM>your</EM> people?" 
<P>
So the British guy calls up one of his people and says: "Trevor, jump off the 
mast and swim under the keel of the ship, will you, old chap?" 
<P>
Trevor stares at his general. 
<P>
"Let me get this right. You want me to jump off the mast." 
<P>
"Yes." 
<P>
"And swim under the keel" 
<P>
"Yes." 
<P>
"You must be daft!" 
<P>
And so saying, Trevor turns around and saunters off. Whereupon the British 
General turns to the other two and says, 
<P>
"Now <EM>there</EM>'s an example of TRUE courage!" 
<P>
