Disorder in the Court: a Collection of 'Transquips' 
Collected by Richard Lederer, reprinted in N.H. Business Review 
<P>
Most  language  is  spoken  language,  and most words, once they are 
uttered, vanish forever into the air.  But such is not the case with 
language spoken during courtroom trials, for there exists an army of 
courtroom reporters whose job it  is to take down and preserve every 
statement made during the proceedings. 
<P>
Mary Louise Gilman, the venerable editor of the  National  Shorthand 
Reporter has collected many of the more hilarious courtroom bloopers 
in two books - Humor in the Court (1977) and More Humor in the Court, 
published a few months ago.   From  Mrs.  Gilman's two volumes, here 
are some of my favorite transquips, all recorded by America's keepers 
of the word:

<P>
Q.  He's been your brother-in-law for years, and you can't remember 
his first name? 
<P>
A.  No.  I tell you I'm too excited. (Rising from the witness chair 
and pointing to Mr. Borofkin.) Nathan, for God's sake, tell them 
your first name!
