SCENE:  It's a fine sunny day in the forest, and a rabbit is sitting 
outside his burrow, tippy-tapping on his typewriter. 
<P>
Along comes a fox, out for a walk. 
<P>
FOX:    "What are you working on?" 
<P>
RABBIT: "My thesis." 
<P>
FOX:    "Hmm.  What's it about?" 
<P>
RABBIT: "Oh, I'm writing about how rabbits eat foxes." 
<P>
(incredulous pause) 
<P>
FOX:    "That's ridiculous!  Any fool knows that rabbits don't eat foxes." 
<P>
RABBIT: "Sure they do, and I can prove it.  Come with me." 
<P>
They both disappear into the rabbit's burrow.  After a few 
minutes, the rabbit returns, alone, to his typewriter and resumes 
typing. 
<P>
Soon, a wolf comes along and stops to watch the hardworking 
rabbit. 
<P>
WOLF:   "What's that you're writing?" 
<P>
RABBIT: "I'm doing a thesis on how rabbits eat wolves." 
<P>
(loud guffaws) 
<P>
WOLF:   "You don't expect to get such rubbish published, do you?" 
<P>
RABBIT: "No problem.  Do you want to see why?" 
<P>
The rabbit and the wolf go into the burrow, and again the rabbit 
returns by himself, after a few minutes, and goes back to typing. 
<P>
SCENE:  Inside the rabbit's burrow.  In one corner, there is a pile of 
fox bones.  In another corner, a pile of wolf bones.  On the other 
side of the room a huge lion is belching and picking his teeth. 
<P>
(The End) 
<P>
<PRE>MORAL:  It doesn't matter what you choose for a thesis subject. 
        It doesn't matter what you use for data. 
        What does matter is who you have for a thesis advisor.    
<P>
