Back in the bad old days when I was working in a fast food joint... 
<P>
There was one female type person on the night crew.  A very attractive 
young lady with a penchant for wearing mini-skirts.  Needless to say, 
we did not object to this in the least.  In fact, we used to let her 
wipe down the tables up front, instead of slopping the french fryers 
and such.  Admittedly one of our reasons was that in order to wipe 
down the tables she had to lean far over them and stretch.  Generally 
facing away from the counter. 
<P>
This was when we learned that she tended to wear panties that matched 
her nail polish.  No kidding!  She came in one day with black nail polish 
with silver speckles, and it turned out that she was wearing black 
panties with silver spangles.  Another day, she came in wearing pink 
nail polish on one hand, and blue on the other.  The panties were blue 
on one cheek, and pink on the other. 
<P>
But ... one evening ... great anticipation ... When would she EVER go 
out and wipe the tables ??? ... She came in to work, and she was wearing 
no nail polish! 
<P>
She never did tables that night, and we never knew. 
<P>
I suspect we were set up.
