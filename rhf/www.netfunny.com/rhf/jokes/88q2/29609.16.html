<PRE>I have found these over the past couple of years and I decided that I
now have enough to post. (Sorry if you have seen some of these before
in one form or another.)


Gutterson's Laws
  
  - Any programming project that begins well ends badly.
  - Any programming project that begins badly ends worse.

Klienbrunner's Corollaries

  - If a programming task looks easy its tough.
  - If a programming task looks tough it's damn-well impossible.

Mungbright's Laws

  - Any given program, when running, is obsolete.
  - Any given program costs more and takes longer.
  - If a program is useful it will have to be changed.
  - If a program is useless it will have to be documented.
  - Any given program will expand to fill all available memory.
  - The value of a program is inversly proportional to the weight
    of its output.
  - Program complexity grows until it exceeds the capability of the
    programmer who must maintain it.
  - Not until the program has been released for six months will the most
    harmful error be discovered.
  - Machine independant code isn't.
  - Adding man power to a late software project makes it later.
  - The effort required to correct software problems increases
    geometrically with time.

Edsel Murphy's Laws

  - It is impossible to make anything foolproof because fools are so
    ingenious.
  - If something can go wrong, it will.
  - Things get worse under preasure.
  - Only after a task have proven completely impossible is it time to
    read the reference book.
  - When a system is designed so that fools can use it, only fools can
    use it.
  - When a program is working perfectly the programmer will not know
    what the heck is going on.
  - There is more than one way to crash a system.
  - User friendly manuals aren't.
  - A fast and efficient time-sharing system isn't.
  - When a computer is most needed it will break down.
  - All major bugs in a software project will turn up five minutes
    before it is due.
  - You will always find the bug in the last place you would look, the
    least expected place.

Farvour's Law

  - There is always one more bug.

Brunk's Law

  - If a listing has a begining it has an end.

Zepplemier's Corollary

  - The last four pages of a critical listing will be lost.

Pennington's Observation

  - The probability that a given program will perform to expectations is
    inversly proportional to the programmers confidence in his ability to
    do the job.

Dunstone's Philosophy

  - There is more than one way to boot a disk.

Dykstra's Observation

  - If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must
    be the process of putting them in.
