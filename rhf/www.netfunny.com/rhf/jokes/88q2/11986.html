Thanks for the mail from those who enjoyed previous postings of anecdotes. 
For the interested (and the record) these are mainly taken from THE LITTLE 
BROWN BOOK OF ANECDOTES, edited by Clifton Fadiman.

In his legal practice, Abraham Lincoln was never greedy for fees 
and discouraged unnecessary litigation.  A man came to him in a passion, 
asking him to bring a suit for $2.50 against an impoverished debtor. 
Lincoln tried to dissuade him, but the man was determined upon revenge. 
When he say that the creditor was not to be put off, Lincoln asked for 
and got $10 as his legal fee.  He gave half of this to the defendant, 
who thereupon willingly confessed to the debt and paid up the $2.50, 
thus settling the matter to the entire satisfaction of the irate 
plaintiff.

In Paris for the funeral of French president Georges Pompidou in 
1974, Nixon remarked, "This is a great day for France."

Shortly after John F. Kennedy blocked the hike in steel prices 
in 1961, he was visited by a businessman who expressed wariness about 
the national economy.  "Things look great," said JFK.  "Why, if I wasn't 
president, I'd be buying stocks myself." 
<P>
"If you weren't president," said the businessman, "so would I."
