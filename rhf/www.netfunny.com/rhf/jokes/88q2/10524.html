I heard these somewhere: 
<P>
Minnie and Max had been married for 18 years. As Minnie grew 
older and less attractive, Max became disinterested and his 
libido started to wane dramatically. In desperation, Minnie 
hauled him before a marriage counselor. The marriage counselor 
listened patiently to Minnie's complaints and to Max's 
protestations. Max said he was being nagged unmercifully 
Minnie said that Max was causing her anguish. 
<P>
Finally the marriage counselor issued a verdict. "Max," he said, 
"from now on, no matter how you feel, you must give Minnie her 
conjugal rights at least semi-annually." 
<P>
Minnie was delighted and they left the counselor's chambers. 
On the way downstairs she nudged Max, "Tell me Max, how many 
times a week is semi-annually?" 
<P>

<P>
Deep in the Tennessee hills, a farmer's mule kicked his mother-in-law 
to death. An enormous crowd of men turned out for the funeral. 
The minister, examining the crowd outside the church, commented 
to a farmer friend, "This old lady must have been mighty popular. 
Just look how many people left their work to come to her funeral." 
<P>
"They're not here for the funeral," snickered the friend. 
"They're here to buy the mule." 
<P>
