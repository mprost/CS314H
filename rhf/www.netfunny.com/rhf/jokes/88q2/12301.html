<STRONG>[Ed: Yet another compendium]</STRONG> 
<P>
And who says our educational system is in dire straits? I submit these 
compilations as testimony to the debate, taken from children, newspapers, 
and teachers: 
<P>
"This paper needs a few comas." 
<P>
"When papa passed away they burned his ashes and brought them home in a 
urinal." 
<P>
"We sat down to a picnic dinner of fricken chicasee." 
<P>
"You shake milk in a big stirrer machine to make it homicidal." 
<P>
"It was so hot during football practice that a lot of kids keeled over from 
nervous prostitution. Rusty Banazek broke his clavichord in scrimmage." 
<P>
"At the Knights of Columbus dinner, they will serve the same fish as last 
year." 
<P>
"Tomorrow Helen Henry visits the home of a retired Navy Captain and his wife, 
an exotic U-shaped structure." 
<P>
"LOST: Male cat. Needs medication. Owner very worried, neutered and declawed." 
<P>
"Winners at the card party were William Davenport, a turkey, and Mrs. Trudy 
Baker, a chicken." 
<P>
"Dear Teacher: Stanley had to miss some school. He had an attack of whooping 
cranes in his chest." 
<P>
"Dear Teacher: Lynda was away as she had stripe infection." 
<P>
"Dear Teacher: Please excuse the stink on Bill's clothes. We've been spraying 
the garden because it is full of  abnoxus incests." 
<P>
"Dear Teacher: Please excuse Jane. She had an absent tooth. Wednesday she will 
have an appointment with the  orinthologist." 
<P>
"Dear Teacher: Please excuse my daughter's absence for the past week, 
as she had a case of the fool."
