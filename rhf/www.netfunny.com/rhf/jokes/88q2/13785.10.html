<PRE>
A man is driving along the highway through a National Forest late one
night.  Suddenly his headlights illuminate the body of a deer, obviously a
road kill, lying in the middle of the road.  He brakes to a stop and pulls
the carcass off to the side of the road.  Suddenly he has an idea.  He
goes back to his car, gets a pencil and paper, and writes a suicide note,
which he impales onto the deer's horns.  He is laughing so hard now he can
barely drive off, and he just can't wait for the troopers to see this note.
Finally he can't stand it any longer and he stops at a telephone booth and
calls the state patrol saying "I'd like to report a road kill deer about
five miles east of the junction."

"OK, thank you."  says the somewhat bored voice on the other end of the phone.

"No, you don't understand.  This deer is different.  It had a *suicide note*
stuck in it's horns."

"Right!  Stay right where you are.  We'll have a black-and-white out there
in two minutes!"

"Whoa, I don't want to hang around here all night.  It's just a road kill."
says the man.

"Maybe, but the Lieutenant thinks it's murder."
