<P>
</PRE>I would like to encourage each and everyone of you to 
seriously consider the charity described below. 
<P>
Now that the holiday season has passed, please look 
into your heart to help those in need. 
<P>
Enron executives in our very own country are living at 
or just below the seven-figure salary level. 
<P>
More tragic, they will be deprived of it as a result of 
the bankruptcy and current SEC investigation. But now, 
you can help!  For only $20,835 a month*, about 
$694.50 a day (that's less than the cost of a large screen 
projection TV) you can help an Enron executive remain 
economically viable during his time of need. 
<P>
Almost $700 may not seem like a lot of money to you, 
but to an Enron exec it could mean the difference between 
vacationing in Fiji and owning it.  It will enable him or 
her to trade in the year-old Lexus for a new Ferrari without 
jeopardizing those jealously guarded "retirement" accounts 
in Switzerland and the Caymans. To you, seven hundred 
dollars is nothing more than rent, a car note, or a second 
mortgage payment. 
<P>
Each month, you will receive a complete financial report 
on the exec you sponsor.  Detailed information about his/ 
her stocks, bonds, 401(k), real estate, and other 
investment holdings will be mailed to your home.  Imagine 
the joy as you watch your executive's portfolio grow 
exponentially--and that's just his disclosed assets! 
<P>
Plus, upon signing up for this program, you will receive a 
photo of the exec (unsigned) - for a signed photo, please 
include an additional $50.00.  Put the photo on your 
refrigerator to remind you of other people's suffering. 
<P>
Your Enron exec will be told that he/she has a SPECIAL 
FRIEND who just wants to help in a time of need. 
Although the exec won't know your name, he or she will 
be able to make collect calls to your home via a special 
operator just in case additional funds are needed for 
unexpected expenses.  And there will be those.  As poor 
Mrs. Ley so sincerely reported, her husband somehow 
managed to misplace over $100 million that he received 
in just the last 2 years.  Stephen King couldn't script a 
scenario more frightening. 
<P>
I'd write more, but I'm having trouble seeing through my 
tears.  Thank you for your expression of love. 
<P>
