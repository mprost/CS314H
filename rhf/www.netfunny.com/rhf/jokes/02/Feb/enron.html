<BR>Feudalism<BR>
You have two cows.<BR>
Your lord takes some of the milk.<BR>
<P>
Fascism<BR>
You have two cows.<BR>
The government takes both, hires you to take care of them<BR>
and sells you the milk.<BR>
<P>
Communism<BR>
You have two cows.<BR>
You must take care of them, but the government takes all the<BR>
milk.<BR>
<P>
Capitalism<BR>
You have two cows.<BR>
You sell one and buy a bull.<BR>
Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows.<BR>
You sell them and retire on the income.<BR>
<P>
Enron<BR>
You have two cows.<BR>
You borrow 80% of the forward value of the two cows from<BR>
your bank, then buy another cow with 5% down and the rest<BR>
financed by the seller on a note callable if your market cap<BR>
goes below $20B at a rate 2 times prime. You now sell three<BR>
cows to your publicly listed company, using letters of<BR>
credit opened by your brother-in-law at a 2nd bank, then<BR>
execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer<BR>
so that you get four cows back, with a tax exemption for<BR>
five cows. The milk rights of six cows are transferred via<BR>
an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by<BR>
the majority shareholder who sells the rights to seven cows<BR>
back to your listed company. The annual report says the<BR>
company owns eight cows, with an option on one more and this<BR>
transaction process is upheld by your independent auditor<BR>
and no Balance Sheet provided with the press release that<BR>
announces that Enron as a major owner of cows will begin<BR>
trading cows via the Internet site COW (cows on web). I am<BR>
sure you now fully understand what happen.<BR>
