</PRE>Men &amp; women compliment each other by the unique traits we were each given: 
<P>
<BR>Women:<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Women have strengths that amaze men.  They carry children, they 
carry hardships, they carry burdens, but they hold happiness, love 
and joy. They smile when they want to scream.  They sing when they 
want to cry. They cry when they are happy and laugh when they are 
nervous.  Women wait by the phone for a "safe at home call" from a 
friend after a snowy drive home.  They are childcare workers, 
executives, attorneys, stay-at-home moms, bikers, babes, &amp; your 
neighbors.  They wear suits, jeans, and they wear uniforms.  They 
fight for what they believe in and they stand up against injustice. 
They walk and talk the extra mile to get their children in the right 
schools and to get their family the right health care.They go to the 
doctor with a frightened friend.Women are honest, loyal and 
forgiving.  They are smart, knowing that knowledge is power. But 
they still know how to use their softer side to make a point.Women 
want to be the best for their family &amp; their friends and 
themselves.Their hearts break when a friend dies.  They have sorrow 
at the loss of a family member, yet they are strong when they think 
there is no strength left.  They drive, fly, walk, run or e-mail you 
to show how much they care about you.  The heart of a woman is what 
makes the world spin!  Women do more than just give birth.  They 
bring joy and hope.  They give compassion and ideals.  They give 
moral support to their family and friends and all they want back is 
a hug, a smile and for you to do the same to people 
you come in contact with. 
<P>
<BR>MEN:<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Men are good at lifting heavy shit and killing bugs.
