</PRE>Dear Abby: 
<P>
I have been engaged for  almost a year. I am to be married next month. My 
fiancée's mother is not only very attractive but really great and 
understanding. She is putting the entire wedding together and invited 
me to her place to go over the invitation list because it had grown a 
bit beyond  what we had expected it to be. When I got to her  place we 
reviewed the list and trimmed it down to just under a hundred ... then 
she floored me. She said that in a month I would be a married man and 
that before that happened, she wanted to have sex with me.  Then she just 
stood up and walked to her bedroom and on her way said that I knew where 
the front door was if I wanted to leave. 
<P>
I stood there for about five minutes and finally decided that I knew 
exactly how to  deal with this situation. I headed straight out the front 
door...There, leaning against my car was her husband, my father-in-law 
to be. He was smiling. He explained that they just wanted to be sure I 
was a good kid and would be true to their little girl. I shook his hand 
and he congratulated me on passing their little test. 
<P>
Abby, should I tell my fiancée what her parents did, and that I thought 
their "little test" was asinine and insulting to my character? Or should 
I keep the whole thing to myself including the fact that the reason I 
was walking out to my car was to get a condom? 
<P>
