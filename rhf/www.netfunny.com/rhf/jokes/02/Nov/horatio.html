</PRE>Michael the Dragon Master was an official in King Arthur's court. 
He had a long-standing obsession to nuzzle the beautiful Queen's 
voluptuous breasts but he knew the penalty for this would be death. 
<P>
One day he revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Horatio, 
who was the King's chief physician. Horatio said, "I can arrange 
it, but I will need 1,000 gold coins to pay bribes." Michael the 
Dragon Master readily agreed. 
<P>
The next day Horatio the physician made up a batch of itching 
lotion and poured a little of it into the Queen's brassiere while 
she was taking a bath. Soon after she dressed the itching commenced 
and grew in intensity. Upon being called to the royal chambers, 
Horatio told the King that only a special saliva, if applied for 
four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown 
such a saliva was only to be found in Michael the Dragon Master's 
mouth. 
<P>
King Arthur summoned Michael the Dragon Master. Michael the Dragon 
Master slipped the antidote to the itching lotion, which Horatio 
had given him, into his mouth and for the next four hours worked 
passionately on the Queen's magnificent breasts. 
<P>
Satisfied, he returned to his chamber and found Horatio demanding 
payment. However, with his obsession now satisfied, he refused to 
pay Horatio anything and shooed him away, knowing that Horatio 
could never report this matter to the King. 
<P>
The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching 
lotion onto King Arthur's loincloth. King Arthur summoned Michael 
the Dragon Master. 
<P>
Moral of the story: Pay your bills! 
<P>
