</PRE>A police officer pulls a guy over for speeding and has 
the following exchange: 
<P>
<BR>Officer: May I see your driver's license?<BR>
Driver: I don't have one. I had it suspended when I got<BR>
my 5th DUI.<BR>
<P>
Officer: May I see the owner's card for this vehicle?<BR>
Driver: It's not my car. I stole it.<BR>
<P>
Officer: The car is stolen?<BR>
Driver: That's right. But come to think of it, I think I<BR>
saw the owner's card in the glove box when I was putting<BR>
my gun in there.<BR>
<P>
Officer: There's a gun in the glove box?<BR>
Driver: Yes sir. That's where I put it after I shot and<BR>
killed the woman who owns this car and stuffed her in the<BR>
trunk.<BR>
<P>
Officer: There's a BODY in the TRUNK?!?!?<BR>
Driver: Yes, sir.<BR>
<P>
Hearing this, the officer immediately called his captain. The car<BR>
was quickly surrounded by police, and the captain approached the<BR>
driver to handle the tense situation:<BR>
<P>
Captain: Sir, can I see your license?<BR>
Driver: Sure. Here it is.<BR>
<P>
It was valid.<BR>
<P>
Captain: Who's car is this?<BR>
Driver: It's mine, officer. Here's the owner' card.<BR>
<P>
The driver owned the car.<BR>
<P>
Captain: Could you slowly open your glove box so I can see if<BR>
there's a gun in it?<BR>
Driver: Yes, sir, but there's no gun in it.<BR>
<P>
Sure enough, there was nothing in the glove box.<BR>
<P>
Captain: Would you mind opening your trunk? I was told you said<BR>
there's a body in it.<BR>
Driver: No problem.<BR>
<P>
Trunk is opened; no body.<BR>
<P>
Captain: I don't understand it. The officer who stopped you said you<BR>
told him you didn't have a license, stole the car, had a gun in the<BR>
glovebox, and that there was a dead body in the trunk.<BR>
<P>
Driver: Yeah, I'll bet the lying dirtbag told you I was speeding, too!<BR>
