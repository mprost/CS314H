<P>
</PRE>INTERNET woman: woman of difficult access. 
<P>
SERVER woman: always busy when you need her. 
<P>
WINDOWS woman: everyone knows that she can't do a thing right, but none can 
live without her. 
<P>
POWERPOINT woman: only Bill Gates has the will to use her more than half an 
hour. 
<P>
EXCEL woman: they say she can do a lot of things but you mostly use her for 
your four basic needs. 
<P>
WORD woman: she has always a surprise reserved for you, but no one in the 
world is able to fully understand her 
<P>
DOS woman.: everyone has had her at least once, but no one wants her 
anymore. 
<P>
BACKUP woman: you have always believed that she has everything you need, but 
when the "X-hour" comes, you find out that she has always missed something 
<P>
VIRUS woman: also known as "wife"; when you are not expecting her to, she 
comes, install herself and uses all your resources. If you try to uninstall 
her you will lose something, but if you don't try to uninstall her you will 
lose everything. 
<P>
SCANDISK woman: you know that she is good and that she only wants to help 
you, but you never know what she is really doing that for. 
<P>
SCREENSAVER woman: she is not worth for anything, but at least she's fun! 
<P>
RAM woman: she forgets everything you say when you disconnect her. 
<P>
HARD-DISK woman: she remembers everything, FOR EVER. 
<P>
MULTIMEDIA woman: she makes horrible things look beautiful. 
<P>
MICROSOFT woman: she want to have the domination over all the men she meets, 
and she tries to convince them that this is the best thing for them. She 
will do as best as she can to make you fight against the other women, she 
promises you that you will have everything you want if you will give her 
your address book. Before you find it out, she will be the only one in your 
life. It will come the day you will need her permission to open your 
refrigerator or to start your car. 
PASSWORD woman: you believe to be the only one knowing her, but in reality 
all the world does.... 
MP3 woman: everybody wants to take her... 
<P>
USER woman: She fucks up everything she does and she ask always more than 
she needs. 
<P>
CPU woman: From outside, she looks like she has everything, but from inside 
she is empty... 
<P>
MONITOR woman: She makes life looks more shining. 
<P>
CD-ROM woman: she is always faster and faster. 
<P>
DATAWAREHOUSING woman: she keeps you informed of everything, except of what 
you really want to know. 
<P>
E-MAIL woman: Out of every ten things she says, eight are bullshit.... 
<P>
