</PRE>To ensure we Americans never offend anyone--particularly fanatics intent 
on killing us--airport screeners are not allowed to profile people. 
They will, however, continue to perform random searches of 80-year-old 
women, little kids, airline pilots with proper identification, Secret 
Service agents who are members of the President's security detail, and 
85-year old Congressmen with metal hips. 
<P>

should ever even think about profiling.
