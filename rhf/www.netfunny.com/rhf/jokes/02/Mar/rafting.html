</PRE>The place: Crytal Springs, San Ignacio, Belize, Central America. 
The time:   School vacation 
<P>
After a week of riding horses, fishing, birding, snorkeling, caving, 
and climbing over Mayan ruins, my wife suggested that we spend a slow 
afternoon, floating down a river on inner tubes. 
<P>
It was a great idea: I was worn out and needed a nice, relaxing, quiet, 
contemplative interlude like this. The river was wide and placid, too: 
just right for a lazy day in the cool breeze. 
<P>
<PRE>    (Is that my hat floating by above me?) 
<P>
Now, trust me on this: just because the restaurant owner's 10 year old 
son wants to come along, 
<P>
    (Drat. I thought I'd clipped it to the life vest.) 
<P>
and you're about to turn fifty, 
<P>
    (I really need that hat. I'll get sunburned without it.) 
<P>
and your 11 year old son says its a neat idea, 
<P>
    (I like that hat: I should save it.) 
<P>
does NOT mean you should climb on board. 
<P>
    (Or, come to think of it, maybe I should just concentrate on breathing ...) 
<P>
I was the last one into the water, and as the guide pushed me away from 
the bank, and the inner tube caught the current, he said, "Be sure to 
stay to the right at the third waterfall!" 
<P>

P.S. In retrospect, it was easy to see where I went wrong - it was when 
my wife said, "I'll get the underwater camera"... 
<P>
