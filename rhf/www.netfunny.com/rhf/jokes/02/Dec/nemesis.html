</PRE>I have a toddler, so I'll probably get to see ST:Nemesis around the time we 
achieve warp technology.  But hey, I can daydream about my favorite ST movie 
("Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan," of course), so I started to think about 
why it was such a unique, original film, and why there'd never be anything 
else like it.  Here's my thoughts on the subject, in no particular order. 
<P>
Obviously, the primal conflict between the Captain and his foe is central 
to the success of the story.  When the bad guy has an obsessive grudge 
with the good guy, coupled with a desire to build his own empire, this 
really raises the stakes. 
<P>
Epic space battle scenes are always good.  But throwing in a cool-looking 
space phenomemon that alters the battle strategy is the icing on the cake. 
<P>
Father-son tension really gives the Captain a chance to be introspective 
about his own past. 
<P>
If the enemy's past involves being left for dead on a hostile planet, 
it certainly adds to his character development.  Ditto for being a 
genetically modified outcast. 
<P>
An illegally developed technology that can destroy an entire planet, 
while leaving it ready for future development is a nice way to spice up 
the story, as well as being an excuse to have some cool effects. 
<P>
Any movie where someone is hanging on for dear life, and they get kicked 
in the face until they plummet to their death, that's a cool movie (or 
was that scene from "The Search for Spock"?). 
<P>
Still, I have to say that having Mr Brains die, but only after dumping 
his memory into convenient sequel storage, seems like a cop out to me. 
I say, if you're going to kill off a major character, really kill him off. 
<P>
Well, I do hope I get to see ST:Nemesis before my son is in college, 
but now you can see why I'm sure it could never be compared to Khan.
