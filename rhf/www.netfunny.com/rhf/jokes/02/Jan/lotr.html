That puts the fear of God in me:  FotR in two hours.  "Abridged"<BR>
is a weak word to describe that result.  The three-hour version<BR>
is already sliced up, just what can you delete from /it/?<BR>

THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING<BR>
<P>
<PRE>Frodo:  Hi, Gandalf! 
Gandalf:  Bilbo, give him your ring. 
Bilbo:  Okay.  Bye! 
Gandalf:  See you at the pub, Frodo. 
<P>
Frodo:  Doo-de-do. 
Nazgul:  Boo! 
Frodo:  Eeeek! 
Merry:  (pops up out of nowhere) Eeeek! 
Pippin:  (ditto) Eeeek! 
Sam:  Ha ha, can't catch us now! 
<P>
Tom Bombadil:  Hello little friends! 
Frodo:  No time for you, weirdo. 
Tom Bombadil:  (disappears) 
<P>
Saruman:  See, all I had to do was cross out "Good" on my 
  business cards and write "Bad," and I'm all set. 
Gandalf:  I never saw /that/ coming. 
Saruman:  Excuse me while I tend to my vast army of evil orcs 
  and war machinery which were in plain sight. 
Gandalf:  Alas, if only he had imprisoned me at the top of a 
  high tower without walls or ceiling so that he could not 
  prevent a giant eagle from rescuing me, instead of in the 
  canonical dungeon deep underground.  Oh, wait. 
<P>
Frodo:  (whispering) Keep a low profile. 
Pippin:  (loudly) And don't mention your real name, right? 
Merry:  (loudly) Or the ring either, right? 
Strider:  Right.  Don't mention the ring.  (laughs) 
  It's okay, I'll save you. 
<P>
Pippin:  (whining) Are we there yet? 
Nazgul:  Bwa ha ha ha.  Give us the ring, little worm. 
Frodo:  Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names- 
Sam:  Hmm, looks like swords work too. 
Strider:  Go away, bad men! 
Nazgul:  The five of us must flee, for we are outnumbered 
  by this one Ranger! 
<P>
Frodo:  Wow, we're in Rivendell! 
Merry:  That was easy. 
Pippin:  Don't knock it. 
Sam:  Elves are cool! 
Elrond:  Get the hell out of my place, I don't need trouble. 
Gimli:  You can't throw them out while I'm here! 
Legolas:  Same for me! 
Elrond:  Right, all of you wankers leave now. 
Gandalf:  But I just got here. 
Boromir:  I'll just invite myself along.  No real reason. 
  Certainly not because I have larceny on my mind.  Nope. 
Strider:  Look, they fixed my sword!  (swish)  Wheeeee! 
<P>
Frodo:  Such beautiful scenery.  The green grass and leaves are so- 
[THUD] 
Pippin:  Where the hell did all this snow come from? 
Gandalf:  Don't blame me.  Who knew that mountains could be cold on top? 
Gimli:  Told you we should go through the mines. 
Strider:  Let the dwarf have his way. 
Legolas:  Fine, whatever, just open the door. 
Gimli:  Ummm, I have no idea how to get inside. 
Boromir:  What a bunch of dicks. 
Gandalf:  Of course!  (applies C4 to the problem)  [POOF] 
Sam:  Such magic. 
<P>
Merry:  Ooooo, dead dwarf over here! 
Gimli:  Boo hoo. 
Pippin:  HEY MONSTERS, COME AND GET US!! 
Gandalf:  Twit. 
Orcs:  Oh good, we were getting hungry.  Do you have any idea 
  how difficult it is to keep an army fed in these abandonded mines? 
Boromir:  (Slash) 
Legolas:  (Pfft) 
Gimli:  (Whack) 
Orcs:  This is definitely putting a damper on our relationship. 
Frodo:  Ouch! 
Strider:  Alas, the Ring-bearer has perished!  Our quest has failed! 
Frodo:  Just kidding.  I did the slide-blade-between-arm-and-chest trick 
  while I was standing in profile to y'all.  Pretty funny, eh? 
Balrog:  Dammit, I was sound asleep.  That really ticks me off. 
Gandalf:  We are so doomed. 
Strider:  Not if we run away!  (does so) 
Boromir:  First good idea you've had.  (follows) 
hobbits:  (already in the lead) 
Gandalf:  (trailing)  It matters not!  You cannot outrun the demon! 
Legolas:  We don't have to . . . 
Gimli:  . . . we just have to outrun *you*. 
Balrog:  Your ass is mine, wizard.  (drags Gandalf down with him) 
Strider:  Woe is upon our company, that Gandalf has fallen! 
Frodo:  I'm over it. 
Sam:  Yeah, let's go, there's no food here. 
<P>
Legolas:  Wondrous are these woods! 
Gimli:  And full of cutthroat elves. 
Celeborn:  We were told of your coming.  Well, "warned" is more accurate. 
Galadriel:  I know you better than you know yourselves. 
Sam:  You've got nothing better to do with your time? 
Galadriel:  Wake up, Frodo, and look in the mirror. 
Frodo:  Geez, can't a guy get some sleep around here?  What mirror 
  are you babbling about, there's just this birdbath full of water. 
Galadriel:  But it shows magic pictures of things that may or may not be! 
Frodo:  I'm guessing you're a day trader.  Here, you take the ring. 
Galadriel:  I will not.  (hangs her head)  I lost the instructions. 
Frodo:  Great, I'm still stuck with it. 
Celeborn:  Check-out time! 
<P>
Pippin:  (singing)  Row row row your boat, gently down- 
Gimli:  Shut the hell up.  Seven hours of that is enough. 
Strider:  All this beautiful scenery is giving me a very bad feeling. 
<P>
Boromir:  Give me the ring. 
Frodo:  Notice as I put it on that it not only makes me invisible, 
  it also apparently teleports me away from your clutches. 
Boromir:  Arrrrrgghhh!  I'm just trying to save my kingdom! 
  Where is a rake I can step on, that it might strike my head? 
  Ah, this will do nicely.  (whack) 
Frodo:  Best thing for me to do now is head for the most dangerous 
  place in the world. 
Sam:  Works for me.  (they leave) 
SuperOrcs:  Kill kill kill! 
Merry:  Help, help, Auntie Em!  (waves his tiny sword pathetically) 
Pippin:  Christ, look at the <B>size</B> of these guys, we're dead meat. 
Boromir:  Fear not, little hobbits, I shall blow my special horn and 
  we shall be rescued by soldiers . . who are . . hundreds . . of . . 
  miles . . away . . guess we are pretty stuffed after all.  (dies) 
SuperOrcs:  Kill kill kill! 
Legolas:  Look at my form.  Damn, I'm good. 
Gimli:  I'm environmentally friendly --- blood makes the grass grow. 
Strider:  Looks like Frodo got away.  Well, there's no chance in hell 
  I'm going to step one foot closer to Mordor, so let's go the exact 
  opposite direction. 
Legolas:  Okay. 
Gimli:  Sure. 
<P>
        THE END 
<P>
Yeah, that's about two hours. 
<P>
ok
