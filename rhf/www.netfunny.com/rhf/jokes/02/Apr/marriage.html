</PRE>On their way to get married, a young couple are involved in a fatal car 
accident. The couple find themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates waiting 
for St. Peter to process them into Heaven. 
<P>
While waiting, they begin to wonder: Could they possibly get married in Heaven? 
When St. Peter shows up, they asked him. St. Peter says, "I don't know. This is 
the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out," and he leaves. 
<P>
The couple sat and waited for an answer. . . . for a couple of months. While 
they waited, they discussed that IF they were allowed to get married in Heaven, 
SHOULD they get married, what with the eternal aspect of it all. 
<P>
"What if it doesn't work?" they wondered, "Are we stuck together FOREVER?" 
<P>
After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat 
bedraggled. "Yes," he informs the couple, "you CAN get married in Heaven." 
<P>
"Great!" said the couple, "But we were just wondering, what if things don't 
work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?" 
<P>
St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slams his clipboard to the ground. 
<P>
"What's wrong?" asked the frightened couple. 
<P>
"OH, COME ON!!" St. Peter shouts, "It took me three months to find a priest up 
here! Do you have ANY idea how long it'll take me to find a lawyer?" 
<P>
