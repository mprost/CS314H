<P>
<BR>The Good Housekeeping Way #1<BR>
Stuff a miniature marshmallow in the bottom of a<BR>
sugar cone to prevent ice cream drips.<BR>
<P>
The Real Women's Way<BR>
Just suck the ice cream out of the bottom of the cone,<BR>
for God's sake. You are probably lying on the couch with<BR>
your feet up eating it anyway.<BR>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The Good Housekeeping Way  #2<BR>
To keep potatoes from budding, place an apple in<BR>
the bag with the potatoes.<BR>
<P>
The Real Women's Way<BR>
Buy Smash mashed potato mix and keep it in the pantry<BR>
for up to  a year.<BR>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The Good Housekeeping Way #3<BR>
When a cake recipe calls for flouring the baking tin, use a<BR>
bit of the dry cake mix instead and there won't be any white<BR>
mess on the outside of the cake.<BR>
<P>
The Real Women's Way<BR>
The Cheese Cake Shop sells cakes. They even do decorated<BR>
versions.<BR>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The Good Housekeeping Way #4<BR>
If you accidentally over-salt a dish while it's still cooking,<BR>
drop in a potato slice.<BR>
<P>
The Real Women's Way<BR>
If you over-salt a dish while you are cooking, that's tough<BR>
shit.  Please recite with me the Real Women's motto: "I made it and<BR>
you will eat it and I don't care how bad it tastes."<BR>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The Good Housekeeping Way #5<BR>
Wrap celery in aluminium foil when putting in the refrigerator<BR>
and it will keep for weeks.<BR>
<P>
The Real  Women's Way<BR>
I don't care if it could keep forever, I don't eat it!<BR>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The Good Housekeeping Way #6<BR>
Brush some beaten egg white over piecrust before baking to yield<BR>
beautiful glossy finish.<BR>
<P>
The Real Women's Way<BR>
Sara Lee frozen pie directions do not include brushing any egg<BR>
whites over the crust so I don't do that either.<BR>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The Good Housekeeping Way #7<BR>
Cure for headaches: Take a lime, cut it in half and rub it on<BR>
your forehead. The throbbing will go away.<BR>
<P>
The Real Women's Way<BR>
Cure for headaches: Take a lime, cut it in half and drop it in<BR>
2 ounces of tequila. Drink the Tequila. You might still have the<BR>
headache, but at least you will be too drunk to give a shit.<BR>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The Good Housekeeping Way #8<BR>
If you have a problem opening jars, try using latex dishwashing<BR>
gloves. They give a non-slip grip that makes opening jars easy.<BR>
<P>
The Real Women's Way<BR>
Go ask mister tight arse cutelegs, single neighbour to do it<BR>
for you.<BR>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The Good Housekeeping Way #9<BR>
Freeze leftover wine into ice cubes for future use in<BR>
casseroles and sauces.<BR>
<P>
The Real Women's Way<BR>
Leftover wine????? What leftover wine???????<BR>
<P>
