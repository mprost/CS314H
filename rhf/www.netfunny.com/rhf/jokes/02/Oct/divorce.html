</PRE>A married couple is driving along a highway doing sixty mph, 
the wife behind the wheel. Her husband suddenly looks over at 
her and says, "Honey, I know we've been married for twenty years, 
but I want a divorce." 
<P>
The wife says nothing but slowly increases speed to seventy mph. 
He then says, "I don't want you to try to talk me out of it, because 
I've been having an affair with your best friend, and she's a better 
lover than you are." 
<P>
Again the wife stays quiet but speeds up as her anger increases. 
"I want the house," he insists, pressing his luck. Again the wife 
speeds up, to eighty mph. 
<P>
He says, "I want the car, too," but she just drives faster and 
faster. By now she's up to ninety mph. "All right," he says, "I want 
the bank accounts, and all the credit cards, too." The wife slowly 
starts to veer toward a bridge overpass piling. This makes him a bit 
nervous, so he says, "Isn't there anything you want?" 
<P>
The wife says, "No, I've got everything I need." 
"Oh, really," he says, "so what have you got?" 
<P>
Right before they slam into the wall at a hundred mph, the wife 
smiles and says, "The airbag." 
<P>
