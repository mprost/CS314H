(Heard this from my mother.) 
<P>
Sam and John were out cutting wood, and John cut his arm off.  Sam wrapped 
the arm in a plastic bag and took it and John to a surgeon.  The surgeon 
said, "You're in luck!  I'm an expert at reattaching limbs!  Come back in 
four hours."  So Sam came back in four hours and the surgeon said, "I got 
done faster than I expected to.  John is down at the local pub."  Sam went 
to the pub and saw John throwing darts. 
<P>
A few weeks later, Sam and John were out again, and John cut his leg off. 
Sam put the leg in a plastic bag and took it and John back to the surgeon. 
The surgeon said, "Legs are a little tougher - come back in six hours." 
Sam returned in six hours and the surgeon said, "I finished early - John's 
down at the soccer field."  Sam went to the soccer field and there was 
John, kicking goals. 
<P>
A few weeks later, John had a terrible accident and cut his head off.  Sam 
put the head in a plastic bag and took it and the rest of John to the 
surgeon.  The surgeon said, "Gee, heads are really tough.  Come back in 
twelve hours."  So Sam returned in twelve hours and the surgeon said, "I'm 
sorry, John died."  Sam said, "I understand - heads are tough."  The 
surgeon said, "Oh, no!  The surgery went fine!  John suffocated in that 
plastic bag!" 
<P>
