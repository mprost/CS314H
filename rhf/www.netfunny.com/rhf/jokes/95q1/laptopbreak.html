<PRE>Dear Professor Gingrich:

     I am a female student in your college class.

     I love your proposed tax credit for laptop computers, and
intend to buy one as soon as the tax law is changed.

     Recently I heard in your class that us women catch infections
easily every 30 days.  Clearly a laptop will be unusable for one
week of every month, so it occurred to me that perhaps I should get
a desk computer instead.  Then you taught us that women lack upper
body strength, so now I think I will get a laptop with a desk
docking station for the one week every month when I get my infection.

     Please, Mr. Gingrich: in the interest of making your laptop
computer tax credit fair for both sexes, you should allow females
to also take a credit for a docking station.

     Sincerely,
     &lt;Name deleted&gt;


Dear Professor Gingrich:

     I am a male student in your college class.

     I have been planning what laptop computer to buy with the
the tax credit you are proposing.

     As you have noted in class, us guys have much more trouble
sitting still than women do, because we would prefer to be
rooting in the mud or out hunting giraffes.

     I think that since we need to take our laptops along on
the hunt, it will be nice to have one of the new wireless modem
services which will enable us to post netnews from anywhere in
the wilderness.  In the interest of fairness to both sexes, I
suggest that men be allowed to take a tax credit for wireless
modems.

     Sincerely,
     &lt;Name deleted&gt;
