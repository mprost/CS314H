<PRE>Ok, a little boy and his mom were walking down the beach and they come 
across a couple madly screwing.  The little boy says to his mom "Mommy, 
what are THEY doing?"  

"Ummm, well, ahhhh, they are having a clam bake.  Yeah a clam bake."
So, the little boy content with the answer continues down the beach.  
They come across another couple screwing. "Mommy?  Are they having a clam 
bake too?"  "Ah, yes.  Yes they are."

So, they go home, and later that night there is a knock on her door.  She 
comes out a minute later and says "What do you want?  It's past your 
bedtime."  And the little boy says "I was thirsty and wanted a drink.  
Oh, Mommy.  I have a question."  "Yes?"  "Were you and daddy having a 
clam bake?"  

The mother, astonished, looks at the little boy and says "What makes you 
say that?"  And he replied....

You have tartar sauce running down your lip.
