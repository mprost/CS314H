When we finally got home from the monthly Rambling Writers 
Conference (this time in Djemaa-el-Fna), we found Fractal Manor's 
main hall shoulder deep in brand-new state-of-the-art totally 
free computer hardware and software for me to check out.  Drat. 
I'll never get around to most of it, of course, and probably will 
end up dumpstering 90% or more.  What I really need to properly 
handle all of the wonderful things companies send me absolutely 
free to review and enjoy with no obligation whatsoever on my 
part, is a trash compactor. 
<P>
I thought I'd start by reconfiguring my main computer, the 
Hyena 986SXDXMCMXCIV.  Right now the sectors on the hard disk run 
clockwise, but I heard a rumor that you can squeeze 0.2% more 
throughput by running them counterclockwise.  It's worth the 
effort.  Recommended. 
<P>
I slid the shrink-wrap off version 7.126 of DiskMember Gold 
(I know, you thought I'd never upgrade from version 4.79, 
especially after all my bad-mouthing of versions 5.33 and 6.02, 
but what can I say?  Only a Corinthian drinks kevis in a Veronese 
cantola.) and fired it up.  No joy.  I reread the documentation 
to no avail, then scanned the whole manual in, OCRed it, spell- 
checked the file and uploaded it to BIX with a question mark appended. 
<P>
While I waited for a response, I tried the software out on 
the TriskaDeck 1313.  This is the machine Bill Gibson uses when 
we collaborate.  It loaded fine and ran fine, but it seems to 
have automatically moved every hard disk sector to a random 
location and erased all the File Allocation Tables.  Luckily I 
had backed up the entire hard disk to a CD-ROM with the new 
BitByter 7000 CD-ROM Mastering Deck (only $40,000 and worth every 
penny.  Recommended.) so in only 6 more hours I was back where I started. 
<P>
While the disk was humming, I checked BIX with the 
Niebelungen Valkyrie we keep in a corner for when Sandy 
Solzhenitsyn is here writing.  No answers yet. 
<P>
On the chance that he might have some insight, I buzzed Bill 
Gates.  He mumbled something about it probably being a hardware 
problem before excusing himself.  That seemed plausible. 
<P>
I called Jan Toady, president of Hyena, who indicated that a 
helicopter of 
ground-assault technical assistants was hovering 
near Fractal Manor 24 hours a day and that all I had to do was 
give the word and they'd parachute in.  (Based on my own 
experience, I think Hyena offers the best service in the 
business, and not just because I mention their products every 
month in my column which millions of avid computer buyers read 
either.  I bet you'd get the same service I do.  Recommended.)  I 
chuckled and said I'd try to puzzle it out a little more myself. 
He said okay and then talked me into accepting a free laptop with 
holographic display and telepathic mouse.  A nice guy. 
<P>
I also got Mike Spindler, Lou Gerstner and Ross Perot on a 
conference call, but except for a few offers on tractor trailers 
full of new equipment they couldn't help me. 
<P>
My wife Svetlana (whose reading program can teach anyone 
with a $3000 computer how to read, and which is now available for 
PC-compatibles, Apples, 
Macintoshes and the Cray XMP for only 
$49.95 plus shipping and sales tax where applicable, have your 
MasterCard or VISA card ready and call 1-800-555-1212, operators 
standing by 24 hours a day) stuck her head in to say Hi. 
<P>
That gave me the idea to try calling my sons for help. 
Number one son Bud is now Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
but when I called him he was busy in the War Room with the 
Secretary of Defense and some darn nerve gas missile crisis. 
It's always something with those civilians.  Second son Robbie 
was in the middle of performing emergency brain surgery on the 
President, but promised to get back to me when he had a breather. 
Chip was arguing a landmark civil rights case before the Supreme 
Court when he answered my beeper message, but he seemed to think 
it was hardware.  That would confirm Bill Gates's idea, if you'll 
recall.  It could be true.  On the other hand, it could be false. 
On the gripping hand, it could be some combination of hardware 
and non-hardware.  A tough call, any way you looked at it. 
<P>
I must have caught youngest son Ernie in an aerobics class 
in his college dorm room, because he seemed to be having trouble 
breathing when I called, and I could hear a husky female voice in 
the background saying, "Don't stop."  He only said, "Check the 
plug, Dad" and hung up.  His comment started me thinking. 
<P>
The Hyena has this long black wire sticking out the back 
that terminates in a plug-like connector.  The plug has two 
parallel flat metal prongs, and a third round prong about half an 
inch below the midpoint of a line segment joining the two flat 
metal prongs, if you follow me.  A little searching behind the 
desk where Jack Updike likes to work when he visits revealed an 
outlet in the wall with a corresponding arrangement of holes.  It 
seemed too good to be true.  I tried inserting the plug in the 
outlet.  No joy.  A quick call to Steve Hawking suggested that it 
was a space symmetry problem, and I rotated the plug 180 degrees 
and tried again.  It slid home perfectly. 
<P>
Well, I'm about out of room here now.  Next month I hope to 
get to this big red switch located on the side of the Hyena. 
Close study of the manuals suggests that it is somehow related to 
the functioning of the plug in the outlet.  I'll have the whole 
story for you in the next column, along with a report on the Jet- 
Setting Pen-Wielders Seminar in Montevideo. 
<P>
This month's favorite game is still Checkers.  There is 
something both deceptively simple and enticingly complex about 
this game that I have yet to master.  Highly recommended. 
<P>
The book of the month is Decline and Fall of the Roman 
Empire, on CD-ROM with clips from Hercules Meets Godzilla.  It's 
like being there. 
<P>
Continent of the month is Australia.  Give it a look.
