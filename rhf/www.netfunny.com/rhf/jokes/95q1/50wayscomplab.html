<CENTER>50 WAYS TO CONFUSE, WORRY, OR JUST SCARE PEOPLE IN THE COMPUTER LAB</CENTER><BR>
<P>
<!--  list-->
<OL><LI>Log on, wait a sec, then get a frightened look on your face and 
scream "Oh my God! They've found me!" and bolt. 
<LI>Laugh uncontrollably for about 3 minutes &amp; then suddenly stop 
and look suspiciously at everyone who looks at you. 
<LI>When your computer is turned off, complain to the monitor on 
duty that you can't get the damn thing to work. After he/she's 
turned it on, wait 5 minutes,turn it off again, &amp; repeat the 
process for a good half hour. 
<LI>Type frantically, often stopping to look at the person next to 
you evily. 
<LI>Before anyone else is in the lab, connect each computer to a 
different screen than the one it's set up with. 
<LI>Write a program that plays the "Smurfs" theme song and play 
it at the highest volume possible over &amp; over again. 
<LI>Work normally for a while. Suddenly look amazingly startled 
by something on the screen and crawl underneath the desk. 
<LI>Ask the person next to you if they know how to tap into 
top-secret Pentagon files. 
<LI>Use Interactive Send to make passes at people you don't know. 
<LI>Make a small ritual sacrifice to the computer before you turn 
it on. 
<LI>Bring a chainsaw, but don't use it. If anyone asks why you have 
it, say "Just in case..." mysteriously. 
<LI>Type on VAX for a while. Suddenly start cursing for 3 minutes 
at everything bad about your life. Then stop and continue 
typing. 
<LI>Enter the lab, undress, and start staring at other people as 
if they're crazy while typing. 
<LI>Light candles in a pentagram around your terminal before 
starting. 
<LI>Ask around for a spare disk. Offer $2. Keep asking until 
someone agrees. Then, pull a disk out of your fly and say, 
"Oops, I forgot." 
<LI>Every time you press Return and there is processing time 
required, pray "Ohpleaseohpleaseohpleaseohplease," and 
scream "YES!" when it finishes. 
<LI>"DISK FIGHT!!!" 
<LI>Start making out with the person at the terminal next to you 
(It helps if you know them, but this is also a great way to make 
new friends). 
<LI>Put a straw in your mouth and put your hands in your pockets. 
Type by hitting the keys with the straw. 
<LI>If you're sitting in a swivel chair, spin around singing 
"The Lion Sleeps Tonight" whenever there is processing time 
required. 
<LI>Draw a pictue of a woman (or man) on a piece of paper, tape it 
to your monitor. Try to seduce it. Act like it hates you and 
then complain loudly that women (men) are worthless. 
<LI>Try to stick a Ninetendo cartridge into the 3 1/2 disk drive. 
When it doesn't work, get the supervisor. 
<LI>When you are on an IBM, and when you turn it on, ask loudly 
where the smiling Apple face is. 
<LI>Print out the complete works of Shakespeare, then when its 
all done (two days later) say that all you wanted was one line. 
<LI>Sit and stare at the screen, biting your nails noisily. After 
doing this for a while, spit them out at the feet of the person 
next to you. 
<LI>Stare at the screen, grind your teeth, stop, look at the person 
next to you, grinding. Repeat procedure, making sure you never 
provoke the person enough to let them blow up, as this releases 
tension, and it is far more effective to let them linger. 
<LI>If you have long hair, take a typing break, look for split ends, 
cut them and deposit them on your neighbor's keyboard as you 
leave. 
<LI>Put a large, gold-framed portrait of the British Royal Family 
on your desk and loudly proclaim that it inspires you. 
<LI>Come to the lab wearing several layers of socks. Remove shoes 
and place them of top of the monitor. Remove socks layer by 
layer and drape them around the monitor. Exclaim sudden haiku 
about the aesthetic beauty of cotton on plastic. 
<LI>Take the keyboard and sit under the computer. Type up your 
paper like this. Then go to the lab supervisor and complain 
about the bad working conditions. 
<LI>Laugh hysterically, shout "You will all perish in flames!!!" and 
continue working. 
<LI>Bring some dry ice &amp; make it look like your computer is smoking. 
<LI>Assign a musical note to every key (ie. the Delete key is A 
Flat, the B key is F sharp, etc.). Whenever you hit a key, 
hum its note loudly. Write an entire paper this way. 
<LI>Attempt to eat your computer's mouse. 
<LI>Borrow someone else's keyboard by reaching over, saying "Excuse 
me, mind if I borrow this for a sec?" unplugging the keyboard &amp; 
taking it. 
<LI>Bring in a bunch of magnets and have fun. 
<LI>When doing calculations, pull out an abacus and say that 
sometimes the old ways are best. 
<LI>Play Pong for hours on the most powerful computer in the lab. 
<LI>Make a loud noise of hitting the same key over and over again 
until you see that your neighbor is noticing (You can hit the 
space bar so your fill isn't affected). Then look at your 
neighbor's keyboard. Hit his/her delete key several times, 
erasing an entire word. While you do this, ask: "Does *your* 
delete key work?" Shake your head, and resume hitting the space 
bar on your keyboard. Keep doing this until you've deleted 
about a page of your neighbor's document. Then, suddenly 
exclaim: "Well, whaddya know? I've been hitting the space bar 
this whole time. No wonder it wasn't deleting! Ha!" Print out 
your document and leave. 
<LI>Remove your disk from the drive and hide it. Go to the lab 
monitor and complain that your computer ate your disk. (For 
special effects, put some Elmer's Glue on or around the disk 
drive. Claim that the computer is drooling.) 
<LI>Stare at the person's next to your's screen, look really 
puzzled, burst out laughing, and say "You did that?" loudly. 
Keep laughing, grab your stuff and leave, howling as you go. 
<LI>Point at the screen. Chant in a made up language while making 
elaborate hand gestures for a minute or two. Press return or the 
mouse, then leap back and yell "COVEEEEERRRRRR!" peek up from 
under the table, walk back to the computer and say. "Oh, good. 
It worked this time," and calmly start to type again. 
<LI>Keep looking at invisible bugs and trying to swat them. 
<LI>See who's online. Send a total stranger a talk request. Talk to 
them like you've known them all your lives. Hangup before they 
get a chance to figure out you're a total stranger. 
<LI>Bring an small tape player with a tape of really absurd sound 
effects. Pretend it's the computer and look really lost. 
<LI>Pull out a pencil. Start writing on the screen. Complain that 
the lead doesn't work. 
<LI>Come into the computer lab wearing several endangered species of 
flowers in your hair. Smile incessantly. Type a sentence, then 
laugh happily, exclaim "You're such a marvel!!" and kiss the 
screen. Repeat this after every sentence. As your ecstasy 
mounts, also hug the keyboard. Finally, hug your neighbor, then 
the computer assistant, and walk out. 
<LI>Run into the computer lab, shout "Armageddon is here!!!!!" then 
calmly sit down and begin to type. 
<LI>Quietly walk into the computer lab with a Black and Decker 
chainsaw, rev that baby up, and then walk up to the nearest 
person and say, "Give me that computer or you'll be feeding my 
pet crocodile for the next week." 
<LI>Two words: Tesla Coil. 
</OL>
