Scoring Scale: 
00-15 points ==&gt;  Go back to your English class. 
15-25 points ==&gt;  Either you have a life or you are an underclassman/woman. 
25-35 points ==&gt;  You can feel your life slipping through your  
                  fingers as you get sucked into the world of Electrical  
                  Engineering.  It could be worse...you could be in CS. 
35-45 points ==&gt;  You should definitely go to grad school in EE. 
45-72 points ==&gt;  You are a lost cause.  You're the EE equivalent of  
                  Carl Sagan.  Please do not contact me...ever. 
<P>

Note:  Please send me your score, as I am trying to accumulate enough  
       data to do a statistical analysis...seriously!!
