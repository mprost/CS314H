<PRE>Two Irishmen were on holiday in Dover and walked into a pet shop.

The first Irishman, Patrick said to the shopkeeper " Can I please have 
a dozen budgies - don't put them in a cage just put them in a box and 
I'll take them with me." The shopkeeper obliged and gave him a box 
with 12 budgies in it. Patrick paid for them and waited for Mick to 
make his purchase.

Mick said to the shopkeeper " Can I please have a dozen parrots - 
don't put them in a cage a box like the one you gave my mate will do." 
So the shopkeeper put 12 parrots in a box and Mick paid for them and 
the two Irishmen left the shop.

They went up to the top of the white cliffs of Dover and Patrick took 
off his shirt and took out the budgies, one at a time, and selotaped 
them to his arms. He taped six budgies up his left arm and six 
budgies up his right arm. Next it was Mick's turn.

Mick took off his shirt and selotaped six parrots up his left arm and 
six parrots up his right arm.

The two Irishmen then stood together at the top of the cliffs and 
Patrick said to Mick "Are you ready Mick?"  Mick replied "OK". They 
both jumped off the cliff together 

\..........................
\.............................................SPLATTTTTT!!!!!
 

After about 5 minutes the two Irishmen started to come round. Patrick 
sat up and said to Mick    " I don't go much on this BUDGIE JUMPING"

Mick sat up and said   "No, and I don't think much of this PARROT 
GLIDING either."
