<PRE>Another shoot-em-up at an abortion clinic.  New Hampshire resident
John Salvi got himself a triple play, hitting two clinics outside
Boston, Mass, and a third in Virginia.

Seeing as this topic combines the tasteless topics of abortion and
guns, of course we have to bring you a few jokes about it.  Skip
these if your blood pressure goes up reading about either topic.

The guy who shot up the two abortion clinics in Brookline, Mass.
turned himself in today, said it was all a mistake. He thought they
were post offices.

permission.  

Sitting in our shared office, I was chuckling at a botched ad in "Abort,
Retry, Fail?" found on the back page of PC Magazine.

Dave: "What you got there?"

Me: "It's just ``Abort, Retry, Fail?''"

Dave: "What's that, another John Salvi joke?"

Today, John C. Salvi III, the man accused of two murders in Brookline,
MA abortion clinics, released a statement saying, "If I am not proven
guilty, upon release I will become a Catholic priest."

Oh, so he's tired of murder and wants to move on to child molestation?
