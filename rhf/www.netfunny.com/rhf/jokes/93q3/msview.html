<H4>BURNOUT PREVENTION AND RECOVERY</H4>
<P>
<PRE>1. STOP DENYING.  Listen to the wisdom of your body.  Begin to freely admit 
the stresses and pressures which have manifested physically, mentally, or 
emotionally. 
        MICROSOFT VIEW: Work until the physical pain forces you into 
        unconsciousness. 
<P>
2. AVOID ISOLATION.  Don't do everything alone!  Develop or renew intimacies 
with friends and loved ones.  Closeness not only brings new insights, but 
also is anathema to agitation and depression. 
        MICROSOFT VIEW: Shut your office door and lock it from the inside 
        so no-one will distract you. They're just trying to hurt your  
        productivity. 
<P>
3. CHANGE YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES.  If your job, your relationships, a situation, 
or a person is dragging you under, try to alter your circumstances, or if 
necessary, leave. 
        MICROSOFT VIEW: If you feel something is dragging you down, supress 
        these thoughts. This is a weakness. Drink more coffee. ( It's free.) 
<P>
4. DIMINISH INTENSITY IN YOUR LIFE.  Pinpoint those areas or aspects which 
summon up the most concentrated intensity and work toward alleviating that 
pressure. 
        MICROSOFT VIEW: Increase intensity.  Maximum intensity = maximum 
        productivity. If you find yourself relaxed and with your mind  
        wandering, you are probably having a detrimental effect on the  
        stock price. 
<P>
5. STOP OVERNURTURING.  If you routinely take on other people's problems and 
responsibilities, learn to gracefully disengage.  Try to get some nurturing 
for yourself. 
        MICROSOFT VIEW: Always attempt to do everything. You ARE 
        responsible for it all.  Perhaps you haven't thoroughly read your job 
        description. 
<P>
6. LEARN TO SAY "NO."  You'll help diminish intensity by speaking up for 
yourself.  This means refusing additional requests or demands on your time 
or emotions. 
        MICROSOFT VIEW: Never say no to anything.  It shows weakness, 
        and lowers the stock price. Never put off until tomorrow what you can 
        do at midnight. 
<P>
7. BEGIN TO BACK OFF AND DETACH.  Learn to delegate, not only at work, but 
also at home and with friends.  In this case, detachment means rescuing 
yourself for yourself. 
        MICROSOFT VIEW: Delegating is a sign of weakness.  Let someone 
        else do it (See # 5). 
<P>
8. REASSESS YOUR VALUES.  Try to sort out the meaningful values from the 
temporary and fleeting, the essential from the nonessential.  You'll 
conserve energy and time, and begin to feel more centered. 
        MICROSOFT VIEW: Stop thinking about your own problems. This is 
        selfish. If your values change, we will make an announcement at the 
        company meeting. Until then, if someone calls you and questions your 
        priorities, tell them that you are unable to comment on this  
        and give them the number for Microsoft Marketing. It will be  
        taken care of. 
<P>
9. LEARN TO PACE YOURSELF.  Try to take life in moderation.  You only have 
so much energy available.  Ascertain what is wanted and needed in your life, 
then begin to balance work with love, pleasure, and relaxation. 
        MICROSOFT VIEW: A balanced life is a myth perpetuated by the Borland 
        Marketing Team.  Don't be a fool: the only thing that matters  
        is work and productivity. 
<P>
10. TAKE CARE OF YOUR BODY.  Don't skip meals, abuse yourself with rigid 
diets, disregard your need for sleep, or break the doctor appointments. 
Take care of yourself nutritionally. 
        MICROSOFT VIEW: Your body serves your mind, your mind serves the 
        company.  Push the mind and the body will follow. Drink Mountain Dew. 
        (it's free.) 
<P>
11. DIMINISH WORRY AND ANXIETY.  Try to keep superstitious worrying to a 
minimum--it changes nothing.  You'll have a better grip on your situation 
if you spend less time worrying and more time taking care of your real 
needs. 
        MICROSOFT VIEW: If you're not worrying about work, you must not be 
        very committed to it.  We'll find someone who is. 
<P>
12. KEEP YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR.  Begin to bring joy and happy moments into 
your life.  Very few people suffer burnout when they're having fun. 
        MICROSOFT VIEW: So, you think your work is funny?  We'll discuss this 
        with your manager on Friday.  At 7:00 pm. 
<P>
