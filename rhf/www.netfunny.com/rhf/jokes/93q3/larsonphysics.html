This is a mutation of a posting from one the net's most prolific fungi, 
the B.S. in PHYSICS from Eau Claire who posts long weirdness to most 
newsgroups (fortunately, rec.humor.funny is moderated). It was originally 
titled "Larsonian Physics and Astronomy." Very little has been changed. 
<P>

<P>
<H4>GARY LARSONIAN Physics and Astromomy</H4>
<P>
Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and muffin manufacturers 
CLAIM to be looking for a "Unified Field Theory" in which all 
of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single 
set of laws or equations.  But they have been systematically 
IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! 
<P>
The Cartoonist Gary B. Larson's comprehensive 
GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he 
calls the "The Far Side," is built on several fundamental 
postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of 
space, time and oreo cookies: 
<P>
<!--  list-->
<OL><LI>The physical universe is composed entirely of ONE element: 
humor, in THREE EASY PARTS: space, time, and FUNKY WEIRDNESS. 
<LI>The physical universe adapts to the needs of humor in 
a non-predictable relation. 
<LI>Pudgy-faced children with glasses are DANGEROUS. They 
shrink their parents into MASON JARS. This PROVES the 
existence of the Illumanti conspiracy, using the Masons as 
a FRONT! 
</OL>
<P>
From these postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE 
Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of 
squid, cows, scientists, tentacled aliens, dogs, horn-rimmed 
glasses, and chocolate shakes. THESE ALL TRAVEL AT THE SPEED 
OF LIGHT IN RELATION TO LIGHT PARTICLES. This is clearly illegal. 
<P>
At each step in the development, Larson was able to 
MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the 
REAL physical universe, (squid, cows, scientists ...). 
<P>
All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy 
complex mathematics, in his cartoons. 
<P>
<H4>BOOKS of Gary B. Larson</H4>
<P>
The following is a complete list of the late Cartoonist 
Gary B. Larson's books about his comprehensive GENERAL 
UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe.  Some of the early 
books are out of print now, but still available through 
inter-library loan. 
<P>
<!--  list-->
<OL><LI>"The Far Side" (1981) 
<LI>"Revenge of the Far Side" (1984) 
<LI>"Beyond the Valley of the Far Side" (1986) 
<LI>"Robert McElwaine" (1993) 
</OL>
<P>
[The last four chapters EXPLAIN Robert McElwaine.] 
<P>
Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available 
from: The International Society of Larson Worship (ISLW), 
1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the 
organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory. 
They have other related publications, including the quarterly 
journal "E = mc squid." 
<P>
<H4>Cartoonist Gary B. Larson's Background</H4>
<P>
Cartoonist Gary B. Larson was a baby for several years, but 
then retired. He was five years old when he entered primary 
school, where he was FORCED TO TAKE NAPS! Western society 
is at a low point when the PRE-EMINENT GENIUS OF THE WORLD is 
forced to waste PRECIOUS TIME napping! He was 22 years old when 
he graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree (which makes him 
a scientist) in Zoology. He developed his comprehensive 
GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe while trying to 
develop a way to DRAW SQUID with only a BLUEBERRY MUFFIN! 
<P>
Larson's lack of a fancy "PH.D." degree might be one 
reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is 
NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider 
to CLEARLY SEE THE MUFFIN THROUGH THE RASPBERRY JAM.  At the same 
time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX 
physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, 
even Einstein or Hawkings, well enough to point out all their 
CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, 
IN-CONSISTENCIES, LACK OF SQUID, ETC.. 
<P>
Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally 
test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so. 
He simply drew his theory. 
<P>
A SELF-CONSISTENT CARTOON WORLD is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX 
physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking 
for A SELF-CONSISTENT CARTOON WORLD that works, but have been 
IGNORING one for over 10 years now! 
<P>
"Modern physics" does NOT explain the physical universe 
so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of 
quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who 
agree--like Percival Peewhittle, B.S. in PLANT TOPOLOGY; and 
Robert McElwaine, B.S. in PHYSICS.  And remember that "BLONDIE," 
"GARFIELD," "ZIGGY", "ZIPPY", etc., ALSO once SEEMED 
to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. 
<P>
Prof. Jethro Clampett, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, 
was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or 
still is) President of Larson's organization, "THE 
INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF SQUID," and Editor of their quarterly 
Journal "Squid have NO FEET."  He moved to Tycho Brahe after 
retiring.
