This was shared with me by a colleague at work. Origin: unknown.

A man goes into a bar and orders three martinis simultaneously.
The bartender is curious and asks why. The man says: "I used to go out for
a drink each evening with my brother and sister who have since moved away.
This makes me feel closer to them."

The man comes into the bar several nights in a row and does the same
thing. However, one night he comes in and only orders two drinks. The
bartender is concerned. "Gee," he says, "it's none of my business but I
hope nothing happened to your brother or sister."

"Oh, no," the guy replies, "I quit drinking."
