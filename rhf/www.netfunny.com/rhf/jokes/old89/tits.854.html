<P>
A wealthy young man's parents told him he must be married by his 
25th birthday, in order to fulfill the terms of their joint will 
and get the money.  This was a bit of a dilemma to him because he was 
dating three lovely young ladies and couldn't decide. 
<P>
As he had only one month, he came up with a plan.  He 
gave each woman $5,000 and told her she had a month to spend it. 
And, she could spend it any way she wanted. 
<P>
After the month he met with each. 
<P>
The first one said, "Well you know I love to shop, so I spent all 
of it on clothes!"  "Fair enough," he replied, and took note of her 
decision. 
<P>
The second young woman said, "I think it's better to give than receive, 
so I gave all of my money to the United Way!"  "Okay," said the young 
squire (noting to himself that she must work for Digital). 
<P>
Number three said, "You know I have a mind for saving, so I invested 
it in 9 3/4% zero coupon treasury bonds!"  "Interesting," replied 
the gentleman, taking note of her keen financial acumen. 
<P>
So, which one did he choose? 
<P>
The one with big tits, of course!
