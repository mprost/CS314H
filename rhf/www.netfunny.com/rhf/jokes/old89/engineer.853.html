As told by an Austrian engineer; 
<P>
Three engineers, a Brit, a Frenchman, and an Austrian, were found guilty of 
treason in a former French-African colony. The sentence was death by 
guillotine, but the engineers were given a choice of receiving the penalty 
face-up, or face-down. The Brit chose face-up and the blade miraculously 
stopped inches short of his throat. This was seen as a sign from God, and the 
Brit was set free. The French engineer also chose face-up, and once again, the 
blade stopped inches from the throat. Again, a miracle, and the Frenchman 
was set free. The Austrian, not to be outdone, chose face-up, but just 
before the blade was released was heard to proclaim, "Wait a minute, I see 
the problem."
