The recent passing of U.S. Congressman Claude Pepper brings to mind a 
story that has circulated in political circles for years. 
<P>
The year was 1950.  Pepper, locked in a bitter race to retain his 
U.S Senate seat, faced a worthy opponent in then-Congressman 
George Smathers. 
<P>
"Are you aware," Smathers is said to have bellowed in his stumpings 
through the North Florida pinelands, "that Claude Pepper is known all 
over Washington as a shameless extrovert?" 
<P>
"Not only that, but this man is reliably reported to practice nepotism 
with his sister-in-law, and he has a sister who was once a thesbian in 
wicked New York.  Worst of all, it is an established fact that Mr. 
Pepper, before his marriage, practiced celibacy." 
<P>
"And are you aware that Claude Pepper vacillated one night on the 
Senate floor?" 
<P>
Pepper lost the race, but went on a few years later to distinguished 
service in the House.  Smathers retired from the Senate in 1971, 
vigorously denying the story till the end--but nonetheless 
acknowledging in Florida House Clerk Allen Morris' book 
`Reconsiderations,' (1982) that the tale has by now "gone into the 
history books."
