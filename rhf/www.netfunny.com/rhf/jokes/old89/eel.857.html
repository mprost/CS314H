<P>
Little Johnny was 11 years old, and like other boys his age, rather 
curious.  He had been hearing quite a bit about courting from the other 
boys, and he wondered what it was and how it was done. 
<P>
One day he took his questions to his mother who became flustered. 
Instead of explaining things to Johnny, she told him to hide behind the 
curtain one night and watch his older sister and her boyfriend.  This he 
did the following morning.  Here is what Johnny described to his mother: 
<P>
"Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for a while, then he turned off 
most of the lights.  Then he started kissing and hugging her.  I figured 
sis must be getting sick, because her face started to look funny.  He 
must have thought so too, because he put his hand inside her blouse to 
feel her heart, just like a doctor would except he is not as smart as 
the doctor because he seemed to have trouble finding her heart.  Sis 
must have put some bigger fruit under her blouse this time because her 
boyfriend kept on saying how they were the largest melons he had 
ever felt.  He must of gotten real hungry from all that kissing and 
stuff because she let him take off her blouse and suck on both of them 
for a long time." 
<P>
"Then he started getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them 
were panting and getting all out of breath.  His other hand must have 
been getting cold, because he put it under her skirt.  About this time, 
sis got worse and began to moan and sigh and squirm around and slide 
down toward the end of the couch.  Then this was when the fever really 
started.  I knew it was a fever because sis told him she felt really hot. 
Finally I found out what was making them so sick.  A big eel had gotten 
in his pants somehow.  It just jumped out of his pants and stood there 
about 12 inches long!  Honest!  Anyway, he grabbed it in one hand to 
keep it from getting away.  When sis saw it, she really got scared. 
Her eyes got big and her mouth fell open and she started calling out to 
God and stuff like that.  She said it was the biggest one she had ever 
seen.  I should have told her about the one at the lake.  Anyway, sis 
got brave and tried to kill it by biting its head off.  All of a sudden 
she made a noise and let the eel go.  I guess it bit her.  Then she 
grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he got a muzzle out 
of his pocket.  He slipped it over the eel's head to keep it from biting 
her again.  Sis laid back and spread her legs so she could get a 
scissor lock on it, and he helped by laying on top of the eel.  The eel 
put up a hell of a fight!  Sis started groaning and squealing and her 
boyfriend almost upset the couch.  I guess they wanted to kill the eel 
by squashing it between them.  They must have been getting shocked by 
the eel because they were shaking a lot.  After awhile, they both quit 
moving and gave a great sigh.  Her boyfriend got up, and sure enough, 
they had killed the eel.  I knew it was dead because it just hung there 
limp, and some of the insides were hanging out.  Sis and her boyfriend 
were tired from the fight, but they went back to courting anyway.  He 
started hugging and kissing her again, and by golly, the eel was not 
dead!  It jumped straight up and started to fight again.  I guess eels 
are like cats; they have nine lives or something.  This time, sis 
jumped on it and tried to kill the eel by sitting on it.  After a long 
fight, they finally killed the eel.  I knew it was dead because I saw 
sis's boyfriend peel its skin off and flush it down the toilet."
