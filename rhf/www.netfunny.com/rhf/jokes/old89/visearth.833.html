It seems that God was tired, and wanted to take a vacation.  However, being 
everywhere at once, it was a little difficult for him to decide on where to 
go.  So, he called the Archangel Gabriel in on the carpet... 
<P>
GOD:      Gabe, I've got a problem, and I was hoping you could help me out. 
<P>
GABRIEL:  I'll try lord. 
<P>
GOD:      Well, I need a vacation, and I can't decide where I should go, and I 
was hoping that you could give me some suggestions. 
<P>
( Gabriel thinks intently for a few seconds,...) 
<P>
GABRIEL:  How about Mercury?  That's a nice place. 
<P>
GOD:      Nope, too hot.  It takes all night to get over the sun-burn you got 
during the day. 
<P>
( Gabriel thinks a little longer.....) 
<P>
GABRIEL:  Hmmmm,.... Well, how about Mars? 
<P>
GOD:      Nope, Mars is too much of a party place.  All that whooping and 
hollering, I never get any rest when I go there. 
<P>
( Gabriel is starting to get a little desperate by this time....) 
<P>
GABRIEL:  Well, how about Earth? 
<P>
GOD:      NO!!  No Way!!  The last time I went there, I got this little Jewish 
girl pregnant, and I haven't heard the end of that yet! 
<P>
