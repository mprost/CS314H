While a preacher	was trying to raise money for  his  parish, 
he  found  out there was	a great	deal of	money to be made in 
the horse racing	business.  To his dismay, he discovered	 at 
the  horse  auction that	the prices of horses were too steep 
and all he could	afford was a donkey, which he bought. 
<P>
Determined to make money	for  his  parish,  he  entered	his 
donkey  in a race and to	everyone's surprise finished third. 
The next	day, the newspaper headline read: 
<P>
PREACHER'S ASS SHOWS 
<P>
The following week the preacher again entered the  race	and 
this time won!  The newspaper headline read: 
<P>
PREACHER'S ASS OUT IN FRONT 
<P>
Annoyed by this kind of	publicity,  the	 preacher's  Bishop 
suggested that the preacher not continue	this activity.	The 
headline	read: 
<P>
BISHOP SCRATCHES	PREACHER'S ASS 
<P>
After  reading  the  paper  the	Bishop	demanded  that	the 
preacher	 get  rid  of  the  donkey.   The preacher gave	the 
donkey to a Nun in the local convent.  The headlines read: 
<P>
NUN HAS BEST ASS	IN TOWN 
<P>
When he recovered from the shock, the Bishop ordered the	nun 
to  sell	 the  donkey.	When it	was discovered that the	Nun 
sold the	donkey to a farmer for $10.00 the headline read: 
<P>
NUN PEDDLES ASS FOR TEN BUCKS 
<P>
