A drunk goes into a bar. He is very, very drunk - can hardly stand up. He 
slurs his way up to the bar and says: 
<P>
"Hey, bartender! Gimme a martini!" 
<P>
"No, no," says the bartender.  "You've had too much already." 
<P>
The drunk spies a dart board behind the bar. 
<P>
"Tell you what," he says. "If I can throw three bull's eyes with that dart set 
would you let me have the drink?" 
<P>
"Sure," says the bartender, thinking the guy would leave after the little game. 
He hands the drunk three darts. "Look out, everybody!" 
<P>
Zot, zot, zot. The drunk throws three quick bull's eyes. 
<P>
Well, the bartender had never seen anything like that before, but he has to make 
good on the wager, so he makes a martini and sets it before the drunk. He then 
puts a napkin next to the drink and sets a turtle on it. 
<P>
"What's this," says the drunk. 
<P>
"That's a prize for such fine dart throwing," says the bartender. 
<P>
The drunk drinks his martini, picks up the turtle, puts it in his coat pocket, 
and leaves. 
<P>
Well, the next night, the same drunk goes into the same bar. Again, he is 
hopelessly inebriated; totally faced. 
<P>
"Bartender," he says. "Gimme a martini!" 
<P>
"No, no," says the bartender. "You're too drunk already. Go home." 
<P>
Again the drunk notices the darts. 
<P>
"If I can throw three bull's eyes would you gimme the martini?" he asks. 
<P>
The bartender thinks, "This guy can't be that lucky again. I'll get rid of 
him." 
<P>
"Sure, sure," he says, handing the darts over. 
<P>
Bip, bip, bip. Three bull's eyes. 
<P>
"Holy cow," says the bartender, and he gives the drunk guy a martini. Again, 
he sets a turtle next to it. 
<P>
"What's this?" asks the drunk. 
<P>
"That's a prize for being such a good shot." 
<P>
"Oh," says the drunk, and he quaffs his martini, puts the turtle in his coat 
pocket, and leaves. 
<P>
Believe it or not, the very next night the same drunk enters the same bar. 
<P>
"Gimme a martini!" he demands. 
<P>
"No, no," says the bartender. "You've been overserved already. Get on home." 
<P>
Spying the dart board once more, the drunk guy says:"Would tossing three 
bull's eyes prove that I'm not overserved?" 
<P>
The bartender can't believe that anybody this drunk could possibly hit the 
dart board, let alone get three bull's eyes. 
<P>
"OK," he says, forking over the three darts. 
<P>
The drunk deftly grabs all three darts and tosses them simultaneously. 
<P>
Thwock! All three darts land solidly in the bull's eye! 
<P>
"Unbelievable!" says the incredulous bartender. True to his word, he prepares 
a martini and sets it before the drunk guy. He then lays a beautiful long-stem 
rose on the bar next to the cocktail. 
<P>
"What's this?" asks the drunk. 
<P>
"That's a special prize for being so good at darts," says the bartender. 
<P>
"Oh," says the drunk. "All out of roast beef on a hard roll, huh?" 
<P>
