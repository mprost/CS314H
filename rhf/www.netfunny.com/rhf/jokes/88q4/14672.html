A policeman is walking his beat when he finds a totally drunk man collapsed 
against a building, weeping uncontrollably and holding his car keys in his 
hands.  He's moaning something about 'They took my car!'.  Seeing he is quite 
well dressed, the cop thinks he may have a real case of theft on his hands and 
proceeds to question the man. 
<P>
"What are your car keys doing out?" 
<P>
"My car, it was right on the end of my key, and those ba**ards stole it! 
Please ossifer, get my Porsche back.  My God, it was right on the end of my 
key!  Where is it?  They stole it and it was right here; right on my key! 
<P>
"OK, OK, stand up, let's get some more information. (he stands the man up, 
and notices his penis is hanging out).  Aw s**t mister, your dick is hanging 
out, would you put that thing away!" 
<P>
The man looks down, sees his prick hanging there and screams, "Oh my God, 
they stole my girlfriend!" 
<P>
