(where "pppphhhhhbbbttttt" equals sticking you tounge between your
lips and blowing air. A pseudo Bronx cheer.)

A man walks into a bar with a Leprechaun on his shoulder. He walks
up the the bar and sets on down. He proceeds to order a beer for 
himself and for the little Leprechaun. 

Well, the guy and the Leprechaun drink about two beers when finally
the Leprechaun jumps down off the guy's shoulder, trots down the bar
and stands in front of a rather large construction worker. He looks
at the construction worker and goes, "ppphhhbbbttttttt" right to the
big guy's face.

Well the Leprechaun trots on back on hops back onto his buddy's shoulder.
The construction worker is a little ticked, but decides to shine on
this breach of manners. 

After another beer and a half though, the Leprechaun hops down and 
again goes in front of the construction worker and goes, "ppphhhbbbbttt"
to the construction workers face. 

The Leprechaun trots on back and hops back on his buddy's shoulder. 
The construction worker is visably bothered, but decides not to 
do anything again. 

Well shure enough, the guy and the Leprechaun drink another beer.
Soon enough the Leprechaun hops down, trots in front of the construction
worker and goes, "pppphhhhbbbttttt!" to his face. Well, this time the
big guy has had enough of the little guy's manners and walks over 
to the fellow with the Leprechaun, again on his shoulder. 

The construction worker tells this fella, "If your little friend 
does that again, I'm gonna cut off his little dick!"  The fellow
tells the big guy "Well Leprechauns don't have dicks." The big
guy asks, "Well how does he go pee?" The fellow with the Leprechaun
on his shoulder looks at the big guy and goes, "ppppphhhhbbbbtttttt."
