(Our pastor told us this one. I don't know where it came from.) 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
A young couple decided to wed. As the big day approached, they grew 
apprehensive. Each had a problem they had never before shared with 
anyone, not even each other. 
<P>
The groom-to-be, overcoming his fear, decided to ask his father for 
advice. "Father," he said, "I am deeply concerned about the success of 
my marriage." His father replied, "Don't you love this girl?" "Oh yes, 
very much," he said, "but you see, I have very smelly feet, and I'm 
afraid that my fiancee will be put off by them." "No problem," said dad, 
"all you have to do is wash your feet as often as possible, and always 
wear socks, even to bed." Well, to him this seemed a workable solution. 
<P>
The bride-to-be, overcoming her fear, decided to take her problem up 
with her mom. "Mom," she said, "when I wake up in the morning my breath 
is truly awful." "Honey," her mother consoled, "everyone has bad breath 
in the morning." "No, you don't understand. My morning breath is so bad, 
I'm afraid that my fiance will not want to sleep in the same room with 
me." Her mother said simply, "Try this. In the morning, get straight out 
of bed, and head for the kitchen and make breakfast. While the family is 
busy eating, move on to the bathroom and brush your teeth. The key is, 
not to say a word until you've brushed your teeth." "I shouldn't say 
good morning or anything?" the daughter asked. "Not a word," her mother 
affirmed.  "Well, it's certainly worth a try," she thought. 
<P>
The loving couple were finally married. Not forgetting the advice 
each had received, he with his perpetual socks and she with her morning 
silence, they managed quite well. That is, until about six months later. 
Shortly before dawn, the husband wakes with a start to find that one of 
his socks had come off. Fearful of the consequences, he frantically 
searches the bed. This, of course, wakes his bride and without thinking, 
she immediately asks, "What on earth are you doing?" 
<P>
"Oh, my," he replies, "you've swallowed my sock!"
