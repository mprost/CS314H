<PRE>A man had to attend a large convention in Chicago.  On this particular
trip he decided to bring his wife.  When they arrived at their
hotel and were shown to their room, the man said:

  "You rest here while I register -- I'll be back within an hour."

The wife lies down on the bed... just then, an elevated train passes
by very close to the window and shakes the room so hard she's thrown out
of the bed.

Thinking this must be a freak occurance, she lies down once more.  Again
a train shakes the room so violently, she's pitched to the floor.  Exasperated,
she calls the front desk, asks for the manager. The manager 
says he'll be right up.

The manager (naturally) is skeptical but the wife insists the story is
true.

  "Look,... lie here on the bed -  you'll be thrown right to the floor!".
So he lies down next to the wife... Just then the husband walks in.

  "What", he says, "are you doing here?"

The manager replies: 

  "Would you believe I'm waiting for a train?"
