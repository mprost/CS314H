The following story was posted in news.sysadmin recently. 
<P>
The more things change, the more they stay the same... 
<P>
Back in the mid-1970s, several of the system support staff at Motorola 
(I believe it was) discovered a relatively simple way to crack system 
security on the Xerox CP-V timesharing system (or it may have been 
CP-V's predecessor UTS).  Through a simple programming strategy, it was 
possible for a user program to trick the system into running a portion 
of the program in "master mode" (supervisor state), in which memory 
protection does not apply.  The program could then poke a large value 
into its "privilege level" byte (normally write-protected) and could 
then proceed to bypass all levels of security within the file-management 
system, patch the system monitor, and do numerous other interesting 
things.  In short, the barn door was wide open. 
<P>
Motorola quite properly reported this problem to XEROX via an official 
"level 1 SIDR" (a bug report with a perceived urgency of "needs to be 
fixed yesterday").  Because the text of each SIDR was entered into a 
database that could be viewed by quite a number of people, Motorola 
followed the approved procedure: they simply reported the problem as 
"Security SIDR," and attached all of the necessary documentation, 
ways-to-reproduce, etc. separately. 
<P>
Xerox apparently sat on the problem... they either didn't acknowledge 
the severity of the problem, or didn't assign the necessary 
operating-system-staff resources to develop and distribute an official 
patch. 
<P>
Time passed (months, as I recall).  The Motorola guys pestered their 
Xerox field-support rep, to no avail.  Finally they decided to take 
Direct Action, to demonstrate to Xerox management just how easily the 
system could be cracked, and just how thoroughly the system security 
systems could be subverted. 
<P>
They dug around through the operating-system listings, and devised a 
thoroughly devilish set of patches.  These patches were then 
incorporated into a pair of programs called Robin Hood and Friar Tuck. 
Robin Hood and Friar Tuck were designed to run as "ghost jobs" (daemons, 
in Unix terminology);  they would use the existing loophole to subvert 
system security, install the necessary patches, and then keep an eye on 
one another's statuses in order to keep the system operator (in effect, 
the superuser) from aborting them. 
<P>
So... one day, the system operator on the main CP-V software-development 
system in El Segundo was surprised by a number of unusual phenomena. 
These included the following (as I recall... it's been a while since I 
heard the story): 
<P>
<!--  bullets-->
<UL><LI>Tape drives would rewind and dismount their tapes in the middle of a 
job. 
<LI>Disk drives would seek back&amp;forth so rapidly that they'd attempt to 
walk across the floor. 
<LI>The card-punch output device would occasionally start up of itself 
and punch a "lace card" (every hole punched).  These would usually 
jam in the punch. 
<LI>The console would print snide and insulting messages from Robin Hood 
to Friar Tuck, or vice versa. 
<LI>The Xerox card reader had two output stackers;  it could be 
instructed to stack into A, stack into B, or stack into A unless a 
card was unreadable, in which case the bad card was placed into 
stacker B.  One of the patches installed by the ghosts added some 
code to the card-reader driver... after reading a card, it would flip 
over to the opposite stacker.  As a result, card decks would divide 
themselves in half when they were read, leaving the operator to 
recollate them manually. 
</UL>
<P>
I believe that there were some other effects produced, as well. 
<P>
Naturally, the operator called in the operating-system developers.  They 
found the bandit ghost jobs running, and X'ed them... and were once 
again surprised.  When Robin Hood was X'ed, the following sequence of 
events took place: 
<P>
<PRE>  !X id1 
<P>
  id1:   Friar Tuck... I am under attack!  Pray save me!  (Robin Hood) 
  id1: Off (aborted) 
<P>
  id2: Fear not, friend Robin!  I shall rout the Sheriff of Nottingham's men! 
<P>
  id3: Thank you, my good fellow! (Robin) 
</PRE><P>
</PRE>Each ghost-job would detect the fact that the other had been killed, and 
would start a new copy of the recently-slain program within a few 
milliseconds.  The only way to kill both ghosts was to kill them 
simultaneously (very difficult) or to deliberately crash the system. 
<P>
Finally, the system programmers did the latter... only to find that the 
bandits appeared once again when the system rebooted!  It turned out 
that these two programs had patched the boot-time image (the /vmunix 
file, in Unix terms) and had added themselves to the list of programs 
that were to be started at boot time... 
<P>
The Robin Hood and Friar Tuck ghosts were finally eradicated when the 
system staff rebooted the system from a clean boot-tape and reinstalled 
the monitor.  Not long thereafter, Xerox released a patch for this 
problem. 
<P>
I believe that Xerox filed a complaint with Motorola's management about 
the merry-prankster actions of the two employees in question.  To the 
best of my knowledge, no serious disciplinary action was taken against 
either of these guys. 
<P>
Several years later, both of the perpetrators were hired by Honeywell, 
which had purchased the rights to CP-V after Xerox pulled out of the 
mainframe business.  Both of them made serious and substantial 
contributions to the Honeywell CP-6 operating system development effort. 
Robin Hood (Dan Holle) did much of the development of the PL-6 
system-programming language compiler; Friar Tuck (John Gabler) was one 
of the chief communications-software gurus for several years.  They're 
both alive and well, and living in LA (Dan) and Orange County (John). 
Both are among the more brilliant people I've had the pleasure of 
working with. 
<P>
Disclaimers: it has been quite a while since I heard the details of how 
this all went down, so some of the details above are almost certainly 
wrong.  I shared an apartment with John Gabler for several years, and he 
was my Best Man when I married back in '86... so I'm somewhat 
predisposed to believe his version of the events that occurred.
