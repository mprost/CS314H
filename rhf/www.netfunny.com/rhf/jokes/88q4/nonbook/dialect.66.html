A great Soviet general was once asked by his adjutant, "Comrade General, 
what is the meaning of Marxist dialectic?" 
<P>
The general replied, "I will explain it to you with an example. A filthy 
man is standing outside a bath house.  Will he go in?" 
<P>
"Of course," replied the adjutant. 
<P>
"No, you're wrong," said the general.  "A filthy man is filthy by his nature, 
and will not go in to the bath house.  Only clean men, knowing the virtues of 
cleanliness, will bathe." 
<P>
"I understand, comrade general." 
<P>
"Now, let me give you another example.  A filthy man is standing outside 
a bath house.  Will he go in?" 
<P>
"Absolutely not," replied the adjutant immediately. 
<P>
"You're wrong again," said the general.  "Why should a filthy man not 
enter a bath house?  He is dirty, the bath house is there to enable him to 
become clean, and he will use it." 
<P>
"I think I understand, comrade." 
<P>
"Now, one last example.  A filthy man is standing outside a bath house. 
Will he go in?" 
<P>
"How the hell should I know?" 
<P>
"Now, comrade, you truly understand the meaning of Marxist dialectic." 
<P>
(A very similar joke from Leo Rosten's <I>The Joys Of Yiddish</I> (If you haven't 
got a copy of this book, then drop everything and go out and buy a copy--it's 
full of jokes, folk sayings and other assorted witticisms.))
