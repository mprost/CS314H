A mom writing her Aggie son: 
<P>
Dear son, 
<P>
I'm writing this slow 'cause I know you can't read fast. We don't live where 
we did when you left. Your dad read in the paper that most accidents happen 
within twenty miles of the home so we moved. Our new place has a washing 
machine. The first day I put four shirts in it, I pulled the chain and haven't 
seen them since. It only rained twice this week. Three days the first time and 
four days the second time. The coat you wanted me to send to you your aunt Sue 
said it would be a little heavy to send in the mail with them big heavy buttons 
so we cut them off and put them in the pockets. We got a bill from the funeral 
home; said IF WE DIDN'T MAKE THE LAST PAYMENT ON GRANDMA'S FUNERAL BILL UP SHE 
COMES !!! Your uncle John fell in the whiskey vat. Some men tried to pull him 
out but he fought them off playfully and he drowned. We cremated him, he burned 
for three days. Three of your friends went off the bridge in a pickup. One was 
driving and the other two were in the back. The driver got out he rolled down 
the window and swam to safety. The other two drowned they couldn't get the 
tailgate down. Not much more news this time. Nothing much has happened. Write 
more later. 
<P>
Love, Mom 
<P>
P.S., I was going to send some money but already had this sealed. 
<P>
