<PRE>OK, you asked for it... 
[ I don't usually do light bulb jokes, saving them for the collectors, but 
  these ones are topical and a few are worthwhile. Obviously many are old ]

How many Reaganistas does it take to screw in a lightbulb? 
<P>
Nine! 
<P>
1) One to deny that the bulb is burned out 
2) One to clarify the denial: ``the bulb is really just dim'' 
2) One to blame the bulb burning out on the ``Carter-Mondale'' 
   administration. 
3) One to blame the bulb burning out on the Congress. 
4) One to ask for a constitutional amendment that will prohibit bulbs 
   burning out.  
5) One to replace the bulb with a kerosene lamp. 
6) One to borrow money from the Japanese to pay for the kerosene. 
7) One former Reaganista to lobby his old colleagues for a special 
   favor for the kerosene importer. 
8) One to cash the check for investing in the kerosene importer. 
9) One to send the bill to the next generation.

Rather: How many Bush campaign aides does it take to screw in a 
lightbulb? 
<P>
Bush: (earnest lapdog voice) NONE!  I think the media's keeping this 
thing alive!  I think the American people are TIRED of lightbulb 
jokes! 
Only 354 days of America Held Hostage remain!

How many Democratic Presidential candidates does it take 
to screw in a lightbulb? 
<P>
Mike Dukakis: "In Massachusetts, my enlightened government 
has made it unnecessary for people to screw in their own  
lightbulbs, as we have put thousands of former welfare 
recipients to work in the Department of Lightbulb Installation. 
These employees will come to your home or business and 
install any standard incandescent bulb, on only a few months 
notice." 
<P>
Bruce Babbitt: "It's foolish to talk about screwing in 
lightbulbs when we haven't even taken the first step, and 
that is to remove the old bulb. I challenge my fellow 
candidates to stand up with me and help me remove this 
old bulb." [Stands, but nobody else does.] "HAH. What 
wimps. You guys make George Bush look like Rambo." 
<P>
Richard Gephardt: "It doesn't matter whether the bulb is 
changed or not; it only matters that the new bulb was made 
in the US of A. Taiwan and South Korea have put up massive 
barriers to importing US lightbulbs; we'll see how they like 
it when their bulbs cost $10,000 to screw in here." 
<P>
Gary Hart: "This oblique reference to 'screwing' is an obvious 
attempt to drag my personal life into this campaign. Frankly, 
I resent it, and the American people resent it." 
<P>
Al Gore: "As usual, the other left-wing wacko candidates are  
putting forth solutions that moderate Southerners won't cotton 
to on Super Tuesday. At least I hope not." 
<P>
Paul Simon: "My media experts tell me I'm foolish for wearing 
my hair the same way I did in the 50's and wearing the same bow 
tie I wore in the 50's. But that's what Paul Simon is all about. 
And I suppose my media experts are gonna say I'm foolish for this, 
but in all candor, I change my lightbulbs the same way I did 
in the 50's: my wife gets on the ladder and I turn it." 
<P>
Jesse Jackson: "Changing the lightbulb is a partial solution 
at best. I'm more of a Lone Ranger than a lightbulb changer. 
But even the Lone Ranger had Tonto and Silver, and the shameful 
fact is that the American Indians of today don't have enough 
silver, or gold, or even paper money to allow them to buy 
into the American Dream or some extra lightbulbs. We must 
ensure that all Americans can light their homes, from the 
lighthouse to the White House."

[Odd, but appropriate linguistic note: the word ``caucus'' is not 
Latin, it is native American, descended either from the Algonquin word 
for caucus or the Abnaki words for persuasion or discussion.] 
<P>
How many Republican presidential candidates does it take to change a 
lightbulb?  
<P>
Dole: When I was a poor boy growing up in Kansas we didn't have 
   lightbulbs.  Now I have the housekeeper do it. 
<P>
Dupont: Light bulbs need to be changed?  Gosh.  I guess the servants 
   have always taken care of that....  With a Dupont administration 
   the power of the free market will be unleashed to produce 
   light-bulbs that never need changing! 
<P>
Robertson: Oh, Lord, with thy divine illumination, heal this 
   light-bulb! 
<P>
Kemp: It's morning in America!  Why should we worry about light-bulbs? 
   Let those doom-crying Democrats worry about light-bulbs! [stumbles 
   over chair in the dark.] 
<P>
Haig: One.  Snap to it, soldier! 
<P>
Bush: I resent that question, Dan.  I've answered it before, and I think 
   the media are keeping this thing alive.  I think the American 
   people are TIRED of light-bulb jokes!
