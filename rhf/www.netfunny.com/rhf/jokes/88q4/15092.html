Here's about a hundred million MORE reasons why a beer is better 
than a woman: 
<P>
<!--  list-->
<OL><LI>A beer won't make you go to church. 
<LI>A beer is more likely to know how to spell "carburetor" than 
a woman. 
<LI>A beer doesn't think baseball is stupid simply because the 
guys spit. 
<LI>A beer doesn't think DOS is pronounced "dose." 
<LI>A beer doesn't give a [expletive deleted] if you keep a bunch of 
other beers around. 
<LI>There is NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO reason number six. 
<LI>A beer will not insist that those odious Michelin commercials with the 
babies are "cute." 
<LI>If a beer leaks all over the room, it smells kinda good for a while. 
<LI>A beer will not call you a sexist pig if you say "doberman" instead of 
"doberperson." 
<LI>A beer won't get a job as a DJ and play 5 straight hours of lesbian 
folk music on yer fave radio station. 
<LI>A beer won't claim that the Three Stooges are shitheads. 
<LI>A beer won't raise a fuss about a little thing like leaving the 
toilet seat up. 
<LI>If you mention a "three-hundred-fifty cubic-inch V8" around a beer, 
it won't think you're talking about an enormous can of vegetable juice. 
<LI>A beer won't whine that seatbelts hurt. 
<LI>A beer won't smoke in your car. 
<LI>A beer won't argue that there's no difference between shooting down 
an unidentified aircraft in a war zone and blowing a Korean airliner 
out of the sky. 
<LI>A beer will never buy a car with automatic transmission. 
<LI>A beer will actually <EM>support</EM> belching and farting and share yer 
enthusiasm for getting them included as demonstration sports in the 
1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. 
<LI>A beer is always ready to leave on time. 
<LI>A beer never fishes for compliments. 
<LI>Some beers (e.g. St. Pauli Girl) have fabulous tits. 
<LI>Beer tastes <EM>good</EM>. 
<LI>If you take a beer outta the fridge just to look at it but then 
decide to drink it, the beer won't accuse you of "date rape." 
<LI>A beer won't raise any objections to an evening of watching 
"John Holmes' Greatest Hits" on yer VCR. 
<LI>An ice-cold beer will nonetheless let you have your way with it. 
<LI>A beer won't think the Circle Jerks are gross just because they're 
called the Circle Jerks.  (They <EM>are</EM> gross, but that's not why). 
<LI>A beer won't make you pick up some tampons when you go to the 
grocery store. 
<LI>A beer won't accuse you of lying when you say you read Playboy 
"just for the articles."  (You <EM>are</EM> lying, but the beer won't 
accuse you of it). 
<LI>A beer won't worry that you'll go to jail if you videotape a Giants 
game without the expressed, written consent of the National Football 
League. 
<LI>A beer won't fill up your car with cheesy 85-octane gas with the 
excuse "but I saved a quarter!" 
<LI>A beer will <EM>never</EM> make you go to a Swedish movie. 
<LI>A beer will <EM>never</EM> make you turn off "Fists of Fury Theater" on 
channel 5 on Saturday afternoons. 
<LI>A beer won't accuse you of being a sexist pig if you say "Gene Hackman" 
instead of "Gene Hackperson." 
<LI>A beer won't make you eat some experimental vegetarian meal that tastes 
like STP Oil Treatment.
