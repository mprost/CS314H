<P>
1/2-sided, sloppy-sectored, 5 3/8 inch droopy disk. 39 cents. 
<P>
As you might expect from this program's name and price, it's a 
bare-bones, no-frills word processor package.  What does 'bare bones' 
mean?  For one thing, you don't get multiple screens - in fact, you get 
no screens at all.  Joe, the program's writer, claims that in about six 
months an update (19 cents) will be available that'll give the program 
video-display capabilities.  In the meantime, you'll simply have to 
remember what you key in. 
<P>
Another upgrade will enable you to type upper-case characters and 
numbers greater than seven.  But don't let these seemingly negative 
comments dissuade you from buying the program.  In reality, the 39 cent 
price makes it good value for the money.  You can for, example, use the 
disk as a coaster for large beer mugs. 
<P>
What are the program's good points?  It contains a 3-word spelling 
correction program called (predictably) MediocreSpeller.  If you 
misspell the words A, AND, or THE, it causes your computer to shut off 
and locks the disk drive head on track 42. 
<P>
MediocreWriter's documentation is in keeping with the program's other 
annoying features.  It consists of a barely legible mimeographed sheet 
with the following instructions on it: 
<P>
<PRE>	 * Turn computer on 
	 * Insert disk 
	 * Use program 
</PRE><P>
</PRE>The program is not copy protected. 
<P>
Explains Joe: 'Who would want to copy it?' And it takes little memory 
space: 323 bytes.  It's available for the Lemming/dos operating system 
for use on Joe's PC (available from Joe for $9.95). 
<P>
<H4>ASST. SYSOP'S COMMENTS:</H4>
<P>
In short, MediocreWriter is Joe's latest attempt to write software that 
works.  It doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is: the 
sleeziest, most limited, bug-ridden word-processing program that exists. 
<P>
Joe admits, 'it stinks.' In addition to its lack of a video-display 
capability, it has a tendency to set computers on fire and trigger 
nearby automatic washing machines.  It handles 21 lower-case alphabetic 
characters and numbers from one to six; punctuation is limited to the 
exclamation point. 
<P>
The program is interactive with Joe's other two packages: Lousycalc, a 
1-column, 1-row spreadsheet; and RottenFiler, a database-management 
program that accepts one entry.  In short, I like it! 
<P>
DETAILS: List price, 39 cents.  Available only for Lemming/DOS on Joe's 
PC ($9.95); configured to drive Joe's Smudge-Matrix Printer. 
($14.95).
