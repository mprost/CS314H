<PRE>
A member of an ethnic group reputed to have a stingy reputation and a
member of an ethnic group often stereotyped as having a miserly cunning
went to a restaurant.  After a hearty meal, the table waiting attendant came
by with the inevitable bill. To the amazement of all, the member of the
ethnic group reputed to have a stingy reputation was heard to say,
"I'll pay it," which he actually did.

The next morning's newspaper carried the news item:

	"VENTRILOQUIST FROM ETHNIC GROUP OFTEN STEREOTYPED AS HAVING A
	MISERLY CUNNING FOUND SEVERELY CHASTISED IN BLIND ALLEY."



[ If you don't understand why I posted this, check out the flamefest raging
in soc.culture.jewish over the original version of this joke.  In that
group, richmond@athena.mit.edu and davidm@ihlpa.ATT.COM are demanding my
removal as moderator because I posted the original version of this joke.
Mr. J. Richmond has even intimated he will take action against me and Looking
Glass Software.  Respond to them, not to me. ]
