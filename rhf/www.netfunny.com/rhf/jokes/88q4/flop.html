<STRONG>[Ed: Recently in comp.misc, users started describing how they had put floppies 
through their paces, and yet still found them readable.  Some folks decided 
the discussion got out of hand, and I enjoyed this one. ]</STRONG> 
<P>
That reminds me of the time, a few years ago when I left home with my 5" 
master floppy in my pocket.  Suddenly a gust of wind blew it into the road 
where it was run over by a passing military parade and it ended up in 
a patch of quick-drying cement. 
<P>
When I retrieved it the cement had set so I took it home to recover as I'd lost 
the backup some days previously.  I chiselled off the cement from the disc but 
then my friend came along and suggested that, as the disc was 'dead', we should 
see how much damage it could take. 
<P>
We nailed it to the ceiling, and hung the cat from it, then used it as a 
dart board, incidentally did you know that if you're a good aim, a dart will 
exactly fit through the index hole?  By now the disc was a little bit grubby 
so we carefully opened the black jacket, removed the disc and  washed it in 
boiling water, making good use of the brillo pads.  After drying it with my 
blowtorch I tried it in my disc drive. 
<P>
Nothing happened for a few seconds and then a wisp of smoke slowly rose 
from the slot.  Grabbing the disc and stamping out the flames I realised 
I had placed it in my toaster instead of a drive.  I found a 3" drive but 
unfortunately the disc wouldn't fit so I had to cut off the edges until 
it did.  Tentatively I tried to boot and... 
<P>
Imagine my surprise when it worked!  all my files were readable, except for the 
ones stored in the bits I cut off to make it fit the drive. 
<P>
This really happened.  I concluded that it only went to show. 
<P>
Has this happened to anyone else? 
<P>
