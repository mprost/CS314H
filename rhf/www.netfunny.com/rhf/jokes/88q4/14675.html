During a recent international sports meet, one of the Scottish 
track and field coaches was entertaining some friends and colleagues 
in his hotel room. As so often occurs the libations were 
used up before it was time to end the festivities. 
<P>
After receiving directions to the nearest wine/liquor store, the 
Scottish coach departed the party. 
<P>
Upon arriving at the store, he noticed that there were only three 
or four people waiting in the queue. 
<P>
Immediately ahead of him were two men dressed in military fatigues 
and heavily bearded.  He overhead one of them ordering 
several bottles of Scotch and rum. Upon being told the value of 
his purchases, this fatigue dressed individual told the clerk 
that he was with Fidel. Immediately the clerk produced a book 
and had the individual sign for his purchases. To say that the 
Scotsman was intrigued would be an understatement. 
<P>
The other individual in front of the Scotsman proceeded to order 
at least twice what his companion had ordered. Upon receipt of 
his total he also told the clerk that he was with Fidel.  Same 
book, same procedure as the first fatigue clad individual. 
<P>
By this time the Scotsman had figured he was on to a good thing. 
<P>
He ordered bottles of this, that, cigars, cigarettes etc.  Upon 
being presented with his bill he told the clerk that he was with 
Fidel. 
<P>
The clerk told him that he could not be with Fidel. 
<P>
"Why not?" said the indignant Scotsman. 
<P>
"Because you do not have the beard and the big cigar." the 
clerk replied. 
<P>
Pausing for only a moment, the Scotsman reached down, lifted up 
his kilt and proudly announced, "SECRET SERVICE!!!" 
<P>
