(He wants some jokes and anecdotes. - DJ ) 
<P>
True story: 
<P>
I used to work for T.I. in Houston.  Once a young programmer fellow 
from the Bedford, England came to do some consulting.  He was a nice 
enough guy, but very stiff and proper.  On his last day before returning 
to G.B., I took him to lunch at a Luby's Cafeteria.  While waiting 
in line, I told him that before he left Texas, he simply <EM>must</EM> try 
some mepyew. 
<P>
He said, "What?" 
<P>
I said, "Mepyew.  It is very popular. Everyone here eats it with lunch. 
Sort of a Texas tradition. The woman in the serving line will ask you 
if you want some." 
<P>
I give a sly wink or two to various prospective diners who 
were overhearing the conversation and looking quizzical. 
<P>
He agreed to order some mepyew. 
<P>
We approached the first station where the lady was selling jello 
deserts and chilled salads. 
<P>
"Mepyew?" she asked. 
<P>
"Yes please," he responded. 
<P>
"Mepyew?" 
<P>
"Yes." 
<P>
"Mepyew?"  (Now with noticeable agitation.) 
<P>
"Yes! If you Please!" 
<P>
"Well ahm not a mind reader!" 
<P>
I laughed a little. 
<P>
Finally realizing that he had been had, he proceded directly to the 
roast beef and mashed potatoes, as any good Englishman would. 
<P>
I giggled.  The people I had winked at giggled.  My English friend 
busied himself with macaroni and cake. 
<P>
Back at the office, Sheila and Mike giggled.  The Englishman studied 
a directory listing. 
<P>
Someday, I'm going to invent a dish called mepyew.  Maybe it will be 
a jello and roast beef casserole. 
<P>
