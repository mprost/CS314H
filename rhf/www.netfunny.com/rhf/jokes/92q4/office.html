From an anonymous (old photocopy) memo recently found ...

	Keeping A High Profile in the Open Plan Office

Never write a note or memo if you can phone or visit instead - everyone
wants to talk whenever you're ready.

Don't sit down to talk - the accounstic are better the higher you are,
and remember that most people are a bit deaf so SPEAK UP.

Try to talk with _at least_ three people between you and your listener,
so that they don't feel left out.

The very best place for a conversation is in the corridor, beside someone
else's desk. If the corridor is full, try leaning against their cupboard
or hanging over their screen.

Never warn people of your approach by knocking on their desk or cupboard.
People love surprises, especially if they're busy.

The best time to disturb someone is when they look thoughtful or are
concentrating. It's your <i>duty</i> to give them a break now and again.

To make sure that <i>you</i> get regular breaks, never use a "Do No Disturb"
sign. When other people use them they're only joking.

Always hold meetings around a desk. If you book a conference room
everyone will think you've got something to hide.

If the phone isn't answered after four rings, hang on. <i>Someone</i> will
answer it eventually, and they might like a chat, too.

Never divert calls if you're leaving your desk. Your telephone could
get into bad habits.

Try to whistle, hum or tap your fingers while you work. It is a comfort
to others to know that you're still there.

If you have to design the office layout, remember to leave lots of
wide-open spaces so that we can see and hear each other right across
the floor.
