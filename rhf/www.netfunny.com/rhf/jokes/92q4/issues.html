<PRE>[Editor's note: this is a little out of date, but still pretty accurate.
 Remember to submit topical humor to topical@clarinet.com for priority
 processing.  Thanks.]

Like most of you, I've gotten too busy to keep close track of all the 
Presidential campaigners and their instantaneous stances on the major issues.
So here at Humal Labs we've compiled a Quik Presidential Issue Stance Summary
Reference Card (called the Quik PISSER card for short). Laminated versions of 
the cards are forthcoming  as soon as the various flip-flopping and waffling 
settles down. Please note that like the candidates stances themselves, the 
QuikPIsSR info is subject to change without notice or reason. We hope that 
with this card you will be better informed in November when you are selecting
another country in which to live. 

Sincerely,

Norman Humal
