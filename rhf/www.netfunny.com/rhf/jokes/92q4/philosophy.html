<PRE>The following comes from Elliott Sober (Dept. of Philosophy,
University of Wisconsin-Madison, ESober@macc.wisc.edu), who considers
it his favorite joke about philosophy:
 
       A boy is about to go on his first date, and is nervous about what
       to talk about.  He asks his father for advice.  The father replies:
       "My son, there are three subjects that always work.  These are
       food, family, and philosophy."
 
       The boy picks up his date and they go to a soda fountain.  Ice
       cream sodas in front of them, they stare at each other for a long
       time, as the boy's nervousness builds.  He remembers his father's
       advice, and chooses the first topic.  He asks the girl:  "Do you like
       potato pancakes?"  She says "No," and the silence returns.
 
       After a few more uncomfortable minutes, the boy thinks of his
       father's suggestion and turns to the second item on the list.  He
       asks, "Do you have a brother?"  Again, the girl says "No" and
       there is silence once again.
 
       The boy then plays his last card.  He thinks of his father's advice
       and asks the girl the following question: "If you had a brother,
       would he like potato pancakes?"
