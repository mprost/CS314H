I heard this joke recently from Martin Black, an Irish folksinger who tours 
with his two brothers as "The Black Brothers."  In the Irish idiom, it went 
thus: 
<P>
An Irish walks into a bar in Dublin, orders three pints of Guiness and sits 
in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn.  When he 
finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more.  The 
bartender asks him, "You know, a pint goes flat after I draw it; it would 
taste better if you bought one at a time."  The Irishman replies, "Well, 
you see, I have two brothers.  One is in America, the other in Australia, 
and I'm here in Dublin.  When we all left home, we promised that we'd drink 
this way to remember the days when we drank together."  The bartender 
admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there. 
<P>
The Irishman becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way: 
He orders three pints and drinks them in turn.  One day, he comes in an 
orders two pints.  All the other regulars notice and fall silent.  Whne he 
comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, "I don't 
want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your 
great loss."  The Irishman looks confused for a moment, then a light dawns 
in his eye and he laughes.  "Oh, no," he says, "everyone's fine.  I'm just 
off the liquor." 
<P>
