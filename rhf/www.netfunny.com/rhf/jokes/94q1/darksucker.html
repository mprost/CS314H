DARK CONSPIRACY INVOLVING ELECTRICAL POWER COMPANIES SURFACES<BR>
<P>
Rewritten by the Quantum Mechanic<BR>
(Author Unknown)<BR>
<P>
Updated 8/7/88  W0PN<BR>
</center>
<P>
For years the electrical utility companies have led the public to 
believe they were in business to supply electricity to the 
consumer, a service for which they charge a substantial rate.  The 
recent accidental acquisition of secret records from a well known 
power company has led to a massive research campaign which 
positively explodes several myths and exposes the massive hoax 
which has been perpitrated upon the public by the power companies. 
<P>
The most common hoax promoted the false concept that light bulbs 
emitted light;  in actuality, these 'light' bulbs actually absorb 
DARK which is then transported back to the power generation 
stations via wire networks.  A more descriptive name has now been 
coined; the new scientific name for the device is DARKSUCKER. 
<P>
This newsletter introduces a brief synopsis of the darksucker 
theory, which proves the existence of dark and establishes the 
fact that dark has great mass, and further, that dark particle 
(the anti-photon) is the fastest known particle in the universe. 
Apparently, even the celebrated Dr. Albert Einstein did not 
suspect the truth.. that just as COLD is the absence of HEAT, 
LIGHT is actually the ABSENCE of DARK...  scientists have now 
proven that light does not really exist! 
<P>
The basis of the darksucker theory is that electric light bulbs 
suck dark.  Take for example, the darksuckers in the room where 
you are right now.  There is much less dark right next to the 
darksuckers than there is elsewhere, demonstrating their limited 
range.  The larger the darksucker, the greater its capacity to 
suck dark.  Darksuckers in a parking lot or on a football field 
have a much greater capacity than the ones in used in the home, 
for example. 
<P>
It may come as a surprise to learn that darksuckers also operate 
on a celestial scale; witness the Sun.  Our Sun makes use of dense 
dark, sucking it in from all the planets and intervening dark 
space.  Naturally, the Sun is better able to suck dark from the 
planets which are situated closer to it, thus explaining why those 
planets appear brighter than do those which are far distant from 
the Sun. 
<P>
Occassionally, the Sun actually oversucks;  under those 
conditions, dark spots appear on the surface of the Sun. 
Scientists have long studied these 'sunspots' and are only 
recently beginning to realize that the dark spots represent leaks 
of high pressure dark because the Sun has oversucked dark to such 
an extent that some dark actually leaks back into space.  This 
leakage of high pressure dark frequently causes problems with 
radio communications here on Earth due to collisions between the 
dark particles as they stream out into space at high velocity via 
the black 'holes' in the surface of the Sun. 
<P>
As with all manmade devices, darksuckers have a finite lifetime 
caused by the fact that they are not 100% efficient at 
transmitting collected dark back to the power company via the 
wires from your home, causing dark to build up slowly within the 
device.  Once they are full of accumulated dark, they can no 
longer suck.  This condition can be observed by looking for the 
black spot on a full darksucker when it has reached maximum 
capacity of untransmitted dark... you have surely noticed that 
dark completely surrounds a full darksucker because it no longer 
has the capacity to suck any dark at all. 
<P>
A candle is a primitive darksucker.  A new candle has a white 
wick.  You will notice that after the first use the wick turns 
black, representing all the dark which has been sucked into it. 
If you hold a pencil next to the wick of an operating candle, the 
tip will turn black because it got in the way of the dark flowing 
into the candle.  It is of no use to plug a candle into an 
electrical outlet;  it can only collect dark.. it has no 
transmission capabilities.  Unfortunately, these primitive 
darksuckers have a very limited range and are hazardous to operate 
because of the intense heat produced. 
<P>
There are also portable darksuckers called flashlights.  The bulbs 
in these devices collect dark which is passed to a dark storage 
unit called a battery.  When the dark storage unit is full, it 
must be either emptied (a process called 'recharging') or replaced 
before the portable darksucker can continue to operate.  If you 
break open a battery, you will find dense black dark inside, 
evidence that it is actually a compact dark storage unit.
