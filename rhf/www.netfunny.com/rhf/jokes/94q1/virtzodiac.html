<CENTER>THIS MONTH'S VIRTUAL HOROSCOPE</CENTER><BR>
<P>
<H4>ARIES (March 21-April 20)</H4>
<P>
This month the bull-headed ram charges straight 
into trouble.  Be extra careful with motion on the third.  Tell the 
police it wasn't your fault.  A moonchild on the jury will acquit. 
<P>
<H4>TAURUS (April 21-May 21)</H4>
<P>
Venus in your house of money spells a new career 
for you, Taurean.  Looks like you'll be working those mean streets for 
a while--but the money will be mmm-mmm, good!  Try to find a nice Leo 
pimp to keep an eye out while you bring home the bacon.  On the other 
hand, if you're a man, you're going to prison.  Tough break. 
<P>
<H4>GEMINI (May 22-June 21)</H4>
<P>
All Geminis are two-faced scum, especially 
my ex-boyfriend.  DIE DIE DIE, you lousy bastard!  A Capricorn native 
will dance on your grave. 
<P>
<H4>CANCER (June 22-July 23)</H4>
<P>
This month, sensitive Cancer is more sensitive 
than usual.  Mercury transiting your natal Scorpio turns you into a 
rotten, unpleasant bitch.  Others will notice and comment.  Your 
first instinct will be to act out that Mars in Taurus urge to 
strike back.  Sit down and shut up instead.  Nobody wants to hear 
it.  Pay particular attention to advice given by a Leo on the 
twentieth.  Re-think that parole violation you're contemplating. 
<P>
<H4>LEO (July 24-Aug 23)</H4>
<P>
Your leonine charms serve you particularly well 
this month, especially on the 31st, when you have a good chance to 
use the persuasive influence of the Moon transiting your natal Scorpio 
to find the willing sacrifice of your dreams.  Careful, though!  A 
law-abiding Libra wants to spoil your fun!  You're the king of the 
jungle, though, Leo--so just kill the interfering bastard and get 
on with the show! 
<P>
<H4>VIRGO (Aug 24-Sept 23)</H4>
<P>
It's official.  There aren't any left. 
<P>
<H4>LIBRA (Sept 24-Oct 23)</H4>
<P>
Aren't you the birthday boy or girl?  And aren't 
you making a pain of yourself by reminding everyone that you're turning 
another year older?  The wise old Moon in your house of communication 
says shut up and let people remember on your own.  The Leos, of course, 
will forget, since they're busy thinking about themselves.  But--trust me-- 
it's best to steer clear of Leo this month.  Besides, if people forget-- 
so what?  You could use some humility--you're the biggest pain in 
the ass in the zodiac, Libra.  Lighten up. 
<P>
<H4>SCORPIO (Oct 24-Nov 22)</H4>
<P>
Watch out for the impending Second Coming. 
Your underhanded schemes are about to fall apart.  A Capricorn 
native plays a big part.  Things heat up near the end of October, 
when Neptune transits your natal Saturn, sealing your eternal 
doom.  Sell all your possessions in the second week of October. 
You won't be needing them again. 
<P>
<H4>SAGITTARIUS (Nov 23-Dec 21)</H4>
<P>
Uh-oh.  Somebody found out where that 
last arrow landed.  Expect a visit from Oliver Stone.  And 
beware of the Great Green Dragon.  A last-minute reprieve comes 
from a Piscean, possibly the one you drowned last month. 
<P>
<H4>CAPRICORN (Dec 22-Jan 20)</H4>
<P>
Truly the jewel of the zodiac, the 
goat, as always, is in fine form this month.  A number of 
unpleasant folks from the past mysteriously disappear from 
the spotlight, leaving you free to get on with your bright 
future.  Neptune finally moves out of your twelfth house 
of the subconscious, enabling you to emerge from the schizophrenic 
haze you've been living in for so long.  Stop taking your 
medication.  It's just a plot by Pisceans to control you. 
The voices were right all along. 
<P>
<H4>AQUARIUS (Jan 21-Feb 19)</H4>
<P>
As the new moon sets in, expect new 
opportunities to come with it.  Your water breaks on October 
tenth. 
<P>
<H4>PISCES (Feb 20-March 20)</H4>
<P>
Maybe you shouldn't leave the house 
this month.  There are some real weirdos loose in the zodiac 
during the next 30 days.  Better to hide in the cellar until 
November.  Oh, wait.  I just took a glance at November. 
I'll get back to you.  Stay low. 
<P>
