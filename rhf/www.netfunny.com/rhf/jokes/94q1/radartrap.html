<PRE>
This story was told to me by a friend of a friend.  I don't know if it's 
true or not, but makes for a great story.  This (supposedly) takes place 
before radar detectors were as popular as they are today.

A police officer had a perfect hiding place for watching for speeders 
along a well traveled stretch of highway.  The location, at a bend in the 
road, allowed him to hide his car out of sight of oncoming traffic while 
setting up his radar to nab any speeders who passed by.  He had used this 
location successfully a number of times, especially on holidays, and 
decided to use it again one Labor Day weekend.

The officer arrived at his hiding place and set himself up, settling down 
to wait for the first speeders to appear.  After a half hour or so the 
officer hadn't seen anybody speeding. In fact most of the cars that 
passed him were travelling exactly at the speed limit, and some of the 
passengers in the passing cars were even smiling and waving at him.  He 
couldn't believe this was happening since his hiding place was so well 
concealed.

Finally, after realizing that virtually all the passing cars knew he was 
there, the officer decided that something was wrong and went investigate.
He got out of his car and walked up the road a short distance.  About 100 
yards before his hiding place the officer found the problem: a 10 year 
old boy was standing on the side of the road with a huge hand painted sign 
which said "RADAR TRAP AHEAD".  A little more investigative work led the 
officer to the boys accomplice, another boy about 100 yards beyond the 
radar trap with a sign reading "TIPS" and a bucket at his feet full of 
change.
