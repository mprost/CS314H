</PRE>Microsoft Addresses Justice Department Accusations 
<P>
REDMOND, Wash.--Oct. 21, 1997--In direct response to accusations made 
by the Department of Justice, Microsoft Corporation announced today it will 
be acquiring the Federal Government of the United States of America for an 
undisclosed sum. "It's actually a logical extension of our growth," said 
Microsoft chairman and CEO Bill Gates. "It's a positive arrangement for 
everyone." 
<P>
Microsoft representatives held a briefing at the Oval Office with US 
President Bill Clinton, and assured members of the press that changes to US 
Government policy will be "minimal." The United States will be managed as a 
wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft Corp. An initial public offering is 
planned for July 4 of next year, and the Federal Government is expected to 
be profitable by 1999, according to Microsoft president Steve Ballmer. 
<P>
In a related announcement, President Bill Clinton stated that he had 
"willingly and enthusiastically" accepted a position as vice president of 
USA Operations with Microsoft, and will continue to manage the United 
States government, reporting directly to Microsoft chairman and CEO Bill 
Gates. When asked how it felt to give up the mantle of executive authority, 
Clinton smiled and referred to it as "a relief." He went on to say that 
Gates has a "proven track record," and that US citizens should offer Gates 
their "full support and confidence." 
<P>
In his new role at Microsoft, Clinton will reportedly be earning several 
times the $200,000 annually he currently earns as US president. Gates 
dismissed a rumor that the US Capitol be moved to Redmond as "silly," 
though he did say he would make executive decisions for the US government 
from his existing office at Microsoft headquarters. 
<P>
Gates did say, however, that the US House and Senate would "of course" be 
abolished. "Microsoft isn't a democracy," Gates said, "yet look how well 
we're doing." When asked if the rumored attendant acquisition of Canada was 
proceeding, Gates would only say that Microsoft doesn't comment on 
unannounced products. 
<P>
Microsoft representatives closed the conference by stating that United 
States citizens will be able to expect lower taxes, increases in government 
services, discounts on all Microsoft products, and the immediate arrest of 
all executive officials of Sun Microsystems Inc. and Netscape Corp. 
<P>
