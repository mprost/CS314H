<PRE>Ole was walking through the mountains of Norway on his way to visit Lena 
and he was thinking more about the supper she had planned instead of were 
he was walking.  All of a sudden he slipped and slid over the edge of the 
cliff beside his mountain path.  About 20 feet down and with several 
hundred more feet to go, he frantically grabbed onto a bush that moved but 
held for the moment.

There he was, hanging by a bush above certain death and his hands began to 
perspire and tire almost immediately.  "Is anyone up there?" Ole hollered.

"I'm here Ole." Came the deep voice from above.
"Who's there? Can you help me?" Ole yelled back.
The voice answered, "It's the Lord Ole,  Let go and I will save you."

Ole looked down and he looked up and he looked at his slipping hands and he 
looked down again and he looked up again.  Finally he yelled back up the 
side of the cliff, "Is anyone else up there?"
