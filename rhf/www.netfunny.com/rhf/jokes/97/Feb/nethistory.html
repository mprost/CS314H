<P>
</PRE>First there was God. He was quite lonely so he created 
Dennis. 
<P>
Dennis was unimpressed with God. 
<P>
So,... God created Brian. 
<P>
But, Brian got bored with God. 
<P>
So Brian and Dennis started playing, and they created C. God 
saw C, and saw that it was good. So he decided to let Brian 
and Dennis play some more. 
<P>
Then Brian and Dennis created Unix. God saw Unix, and he was 
jealous.  So he created Bill to torment Brian and Dennis and 
obscure their creation (for God could not destroy Unix, for 
he secretly admired its perfection). 
<P>
So Bill created Microsoft. And Microsoft created Windows. 
And God saw that it was bad, but it had market share, so he 
was happy. Then Bill got cocky, and his ego got bigger than 
God's. So to knock Bill down a couple of pegs, God put into 
effect a wondrous plan. 
<P>
First God created Tim. And Tim created the World Wide Web 
(using Unix, of course). This was good, but not THAT good. 
So God created Marc. Marc created Mosaic (using  Unix, of 
course). Mosaic created a huge feeding frenzy that has got a 
lot of people who are reading this at their jobs. 
<P>
But that's a different story. Mosaic was good, and God saw 
it was good, so he allowed Marc to start Netscape. Back to 
this later. 
<P>
But all this time Brian and Dennis started to make something 
better than Unix called Plan 9 (because God was successful 
in foiling Brian and Dennis' previous seven plans [there was 
no Plan 8 because Brian and Dennis pulled the wool over 
God's eyes and just jumped to Plan 9, which was too bright a 
move for even God to figure out.] ) 
<P>
Eventually, God figured out how to create Larry. 
<P>
No one knows how or why he created Larry, except perhaps to 
reduce productivity at the Jet Propulsion Labs at NASA. 
[Rumors are that God created Larry because he secretly liked 
what Dennis and Brian had done with C, but didn't think C 
and Unix was enough--this probably isn't true because God 
believed he had destroyed Brian and Dennis' plans by 
destroying Plans 1-7, and by creating Microsoft to slay 
their beloved Unix. 
<P>
Anyhow, Larry created Perl (using Unix and C, of course), 
and God saw it was good, so he made Randal. Larry and Randal 
wrote books about Perl. And everyone saw that this was good, 
except snobs who were too much into C, Windows, and Intel. 
(It so happens that Randal was so cool he figured out a way 
to break into Unix at Intel, and Intel sued him for it but 
that's another story also--chances are Randal would not 
have been able to break into *Plan 9* at Intel, but Intel 
isn't cool enough to be running Plan 9) 
<P>
Anyhow, back to Randal. So Randal and Larry wrote books, but 
they had to be nice because of the people they worked for. 
So then came Tom.  But back to Tom later. 
<P>
Anyhow, God saw Netscape (made using Unix and C, of course), 
and he saw it was good, and that annoyed Bill quite a bit. 
And that made Him very happy, and made Marc very rich. But 
Bill was very very rich.  But that's a <B>completely</B> 
different story. 
<P>
But as good as Larry's creation, Perl, was, it couldn't do 
everything, so God created Scott. Scott announced Java, and 
this was big news.  Now Java really pissed Bill off, because 
Bill also created Blackbird, and Java killed Blackbird. This 
was bad because killing Blackbird also meant killing the 
Microsoft Network. And many rejoiced over that, but that, too 
is another story. 
<P>
Now Java, obviously had done much to annoy Bill. For Java 
was so good that Bill had to license Java. All this time, 
Scott poked lots of fun at Bill because Sun, which was where 
Scott worked, made a better OS, derived--of course--from 
Unix, which was better than Bill's and Microsoft's Windows. 
<P>
Anyhow, even God's creations Steve and Steve who created 
Apple couldn't make Bill license the much superior MacOS. 
But finally, Bill had to license Java. So justice was 
served, and Bill's ego was served him on a platter for him 
to eat his words. Or something. That part is unclear. 
<P>
So by this time Windows and Microsoft and Bill in general 
really sucked. Especially considering the advantages that 
Brian and Dennis' C and Unix, running Marc's Netscape and 
Mosaic over Tim's World Wide Web, doing cool CGI stuff with 
Larry's Perl, which you learned from Randal and Tom, and got 
to program with Scott's Java. 
<P>
And God realized he had put Bill down too far. So then God 
made it so that Marc's Netscape and Mosaic could run on 
Windows. We already know that Bill had to license Java from 
Scott. We know that Bill missed the boat for not beating Tim 
to the punch on the World Wide Web.  The last straw was for 
God to make it possible for Larry's Perl to run on Bill's 
Windows. 
<P>
So back to Tom. Tom was a Perl God. And God didn't like 
this, but Tom's a God so there isn't much God could do, so 
He couldn't stop Tom from saying things like "install an 
operating system on your poor lonely computer the way God 
and Dennis intended," and "Espousing the eponymous 
/cgi-bin/perl.exe?FMH.pl execution model is like reading a 
suicide note--three days too late." 
<P>
The moral to the story? God is fickle. That's why Microsoft 
and Bill and Windows exists. Do what God intended, install 
C, Unix, Mosaic/Netscape, Java, and Perl on your system, and 
make Brian, Dennis, Larry, Tim, Tom, Randal, Scott, and even 
Steve and Steve, I'm sure, happy by doing so. 
<P>
Oh yeah, Linus was cool too. He's the guy you thank for 
being able to run all the cool stuff on your crappy little 
Pee Cee. 
<P>
