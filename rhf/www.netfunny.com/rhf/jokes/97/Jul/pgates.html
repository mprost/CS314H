<PRE>
	Saint Peter is standing in front of the pearly gates with a line 
of people waiting to be accepted or denied into heaven.
	"Okay, now you, what was your occupation?"  Saint Peter asks the 
next man in line.
	"Well, I was a salesperson."  He responded.
	"Hmmm, how interesting, you may enter."  The man enters.  "Okay, 
what was your occupation?"  Saint Peter asks the next man in line.
	"Well, I was a church minister."  He responded.
	"Okay could you stand in that other waiting line there please."  
The minister comlpies to Saint Peter's request hoping that this line 
wasn't the line to hell.  "How about you, what was your occupation?".  He 
asked the next man in line.
	"Well Mr. Peter, I was a taxi cab driver."  He responded.
	"Okay, you may enter."  Saint Peter said.
	"Wait a minute!" The minister screams after hearing that; "I was 
a minister teaching religion and HE WAS A TAXI CAB DRIVER!  Why do I have 
to wait here and he can go in?!?"
	"Ahh my child, that is simple."  Saint Peter explains his 
choice.  "While you were preaching to your congregation, people slept.  
When he was driving, people were praying."
