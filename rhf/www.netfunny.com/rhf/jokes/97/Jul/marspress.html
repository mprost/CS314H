AIR FORCE DENIES STORIES OF UFO CRASH 
<P>
Valles Marineris (MPI) - A spokesthing for Mars Air Force denounced 
as false rumors that an alien space craft crashed in the desert, 
outside of Ares Vallis on Friday.  Appearing at a press conference 
today, General Rgrmrmy The Lesser, stated that "the object was, in 
fact, a harmless high-altitude weather balloon, not an alien 
spacecraft." 
<P>
The story broke late Friday night when a major stationed at nearby 
Ares Vallis Air Force Base contacted the Valles Marineris Daily 
Record with a story about a strange, balloon-shaped object which 
allegedly came down in the nearby desert, "bouncing" several times 
before coming to a stop, "deflating in a sudden explosion of alien 
gases."  Minutes later, General Rgrmrmy The Lesser contacted the 
Daily Record telepathically to contradict the earlier report. 
<P>
General Rgrmrmy The Lesser stated that hysterical stories of a 
detachable vehicle roaming across the Martian desert were blatant 
fiction, provoked by incidences involving swamp gas.  But the 
general public has been slow to accept the Air Force's explanation 
of recent events, preferring to speculate on the "other-worldly" 
nature of the crash debris.  Conspiracy theorists have condemned 
Rgrmrmy's statements as evidence of "an obvious government 
cover-up," pointing out that Mars has no swamps.
