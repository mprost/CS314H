<PRE>
You may have heard that there was a general election in the United Kingdom
last week.  You may not have heard the full story. In addition to the 10
parties which won seats, a further one hundred and fifty-eight parties
presented candidates. Some are from the left or the right, some are based
on special local issues, some are an anarchic strike against the system,
some are different...

I have listed below the parties which seem most interesting to me, with
results for some constituencies. My apologies for any omissions or counting
errors.

21st Century Independent Foresters            (Forest of Dean, 80 votes)

                                              candidate Edward Bear)

(For those unacquainted with the British electoral system, the country is
divided into 659 parliamentary constituencies, each with about 50000 to
80000 people eligible to vote. This time 71% of electors actually voted,
and the winning candidates usually received 15000 to 30000 votes. The votes
listed above may seem insignificant, but in one constituency, Winchester,
the Liberal candidate won the seat from the Conservatives by 2 votes.)
