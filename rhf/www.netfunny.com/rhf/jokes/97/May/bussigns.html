<PRE>
     A friend of mine sent this to me, and he got it from a friend, who got
it from a friend, etc.  So I don't really know where it came from, but I
thought I would pass it along.


  ONLY IN MERRY OLDE ENGLAND (actual trial)

     A young woman who was several months pregnant boarded a bus.  When she
     noticed a young man smiling at her she began feeling humiliated on
     account of her condition. She changed her seat and he seemed more
     amused. She moved again and then on her fourth move he burst out
     laughing.  She had him arrested.

     When the case came before the court, the young man was as asked why he
     acted in such a manner.  His reply was:

     When the lady boarded the bus I couldn't help noticing she was
     pregnant.  She sat under an advertisement which read "Coming Soon The
     Gold Dust Twins", then she moved under one that read "Sloans Liniments
     remove Swelling".  I was even more amused when she sat under a shaving
     advertisement which read "William Stick Did The Trick".  Then I could
     not control myself any longer when on the fourth move she sat under an
     advertisement which read "Dunlop Rubber would have prevented this
     accident."

     He won the case.
