MAIN RITUAL 
<P>
Pillsbury Dough Boy 
Listen to the words of the Mother of Chocolate, who was of old called: 
Godiva, Suzi Q, Little Debbie, Dolly Madison, Fanny Farmer, Sara Lee, 
and by many other names: 
<P>
Swiss Miss 
Whenever you have one of those cravings, 
once in a while and better it be when your checkbook is full, 
then shall you assemble in a great public place 
and bring offerings of money to the spirit of Me, 
who is Queen of all Goodies. 
<P>
In the mall shall you assemble, 
you who have eaten all of your chocolate and are hungry for more. 
To you I shall bring Good Things for your tongue. 
And you shall be free from depression. 
And as a sign that you are truly free, 
you shall have chocolate smears on your cheeks, 
and you shall munch, nosh, snack, feast, and make yummy noises all in 
my 
presence. 
<P>
For mine is the ecstasy of theobromine, 
and mine is also the joy on earth, 
yea, even into high orbit 
for my law is "melts in your mouth, not in your hand." 
Keep clean your fingers, 
carry Wet Ones always, 
let none keep you from Me. 
<P>
For Mine is the secret that opens your mouth, 
and Mine is the taste that puts a smile on your lips 
and comfy padding pounds on your hips. 
I am the gracious Goddess who gives the gift of joy 
onto the tummies of women and men. 
<P>
Upon earth, I give knowledge of all things delicious, 
and beyond death 
well, I can't do much there. 
Sorry about that. 
<P>
I demand only your money in sacrifice, 
for behold, 
chocolate is a business, 
and you have to pay for those truffles 
before you eat them. 
<P>
Pillsbury Dough Boy 
Hear now the words of the Goodie Goddess, 
she in the dust of whose feet are the cheap imitations, 
whose body graces candy racks and finer stores everywhere: 
<P>
Betty Crocker 
I, who am the beauty of chocolate chips, 
and the satisfying softness of big bars, 
the mystery of how they get the filling inside truffles, 
and fill the hearts of all but Philistines with desire, 
call unto thy soul to arise and come unto Me. 
<P>
For I am the soul of candy, 
from Me do all confections spring, 
and unto Me all of you shall return, 
again.... and again... and again.... and again. 
<P>
Before My smeared face, 
beloved of women and men, 
thine innermost divine self shall be enfolded in the rapture of 
overdose. 
Let My taste be within thy mouth that rejoices. 
For behold, all acts of yumminess and pleasure are My rituals. 
<P>
Therefore let there be gooeyness and mess, 
crispness and crackling, 
big slabs and bite size pieces, 
peanut butter and chocolate covered cherries all within you. 
<P>
And you who think to seek Me, 
know that your seeking and yearning shall avail you not 
unless you know the Mystery: 
"We shall sell no chocolate until you pay for it" 
<P>
For behold: 
I have been with you since you were just a baby, 
and I am that which is attained at nearly any shop in the land. 
Messed be. 
<P>
Pillsbury Dough Boy 
Hear now the words of the Chocolate God, who was of old called: 
Milton Snavely Hershey, 3 Muskateers, Fudgesicle, Devil Dog, Mars, 
Willy 
Wonka and by many other names: 
<P>
Mr. Goodbar 
I am the strength of the candy rack, 
and the piece that fell on the floor but looks like it may not have 
gotten 
too dirty, and the deepest bitterness of dark chocolate. 
<P>
No matter how you try to resist the call of chocolate, 
I will hunt you out, 
and I will become your sacred prey. 
<P>
I am warmth of hot cocoa in the dead of winter, 
and the call of the road that leads you to that really expensive 
Godiva 
store downtown. 
<P>
I give you My creatures, 
the fire of love of chocolate, 
the power of jaw strength to bite off a piece of that frozen Milky Way 
bar 
and the shelter of Haagen Dazs when that big date didn't work out. 
<P>
You are dear to Me, 
and I instill in you the power of a piece of chocolate that you had 
forgotten you had hidden, and the power of vision and magickal sight 
with which you can spot a candy counter a mile away. 
<P>
By the powers of the half melted bar in the glorious sun, 
I charge you, 
by the darkest depths of the bottom of the cocoa pot 
and lingering smell of bittersweet chocolate, I charge you, 
and by the beauty of a perfectly formed Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, I 
charge 
you. 
<P>
Follow your heart and your instinct, wherever they lead you. 
The wealth in your pocket can buy you treats that a Mayan king would 
envy. 
Take joy in that first bite of lecithin emulsified cocoa, 
and in the last satisfying slurp of Yoo-Hoo. 
<P>
Yet you must be wary of deceit. 
Eat not of that which is called "baking chocolate," 
for it is vile and bitter. 
<P>
Lastly, always remember to leave some chocolate behind you. 
Be not greedy, 
but let yourself be known as a connoisseur. 
Leave a little for someone else. 
<P>
I am with you always, 
just over your shoulder, 
or around the next corner. 
<P>
I am the Lord of Chocolate, 
and when you have reached the end of you hoard, 
I will never be further away from you than that 7-Eleven on the 
corner. 
<P>
I am the spirit of the wild child, 
the inner child who can never get quite enough. 
If you are a true chocolate lover, 
then your soul and mine are intertwined. 
<P>
Cupcakes and Yoo-Hoo 
<P>
Blessing of the Yoo-Hoo 
<P>
Mr. Goodbar 
Be it known that milk chocolate is not better than dark chocolate 
<P>
Betty Crocker 
Nor is dark chocolate better than milk chocolate 
<P>
Pillsbury Dough Boy 
For both are better than the falsely named "white chocolate" 
<P>
Swiss Miss 
And neither one is carob 
<P>
Mr. Goodbar 
As the frosting is to the cupcake 
<P>
Betty Crocker 
So the creamy nougat is to the Milky Way bar 
<P>
Pillsbury Dough Boy 
And when they are eaten, 
they are yummy in truth, 
<P>
Swiss Miss 
for there is no greater snack in all the world 
than one made of chocolate. 
<P>
blessing of the cupcakes 
<P>
Mr. Goodbar &amp; Pillsbury Dough Boy 
Frosting is keen 
<P>
Betty Crocker &amp; Swiss Miss 
And frosting is neat 
<P>
Mr. Goodbar, Pillsbury Dough Boy, Betty Crocker &amp; Swiss Miss 
Great Goddess! Let's eat! 
<P>
Feasting and Drinking 
<P>
