Q:  How many internet mail list subscribers does it take 
to change a light bulb? 
<P>
A:  1,331: 
1 to change the light bulb and to post to the mail 
list that the light bulb has been changed 
14 to share similar experiences of changing light 
bulbs and how the light bulb could have been 
changed differently. 
7 to caution about the dangers of changing light bulbs. 
27 to point out spelling/grammar errors in posts about 
changing light bulbs. 
53 to flame the spell checkers 
156 to write to the list administrator complaining about 
the light bulb discussion and its inappropriateness 
to this mail list. 
41 to correct spelling in the spelling/grammar flames. 
109 to post that this list is not about light bulbs and 
to please take this email exchange to alt.lite.bulb 
203 to demand that cross posting to alt.grammar, 
alt.spelling and alt.punctuation about changing 
light bulbs be stopped. 
111 to defend the posting to this list saying that we 
are all use light bulbs and therefore the posts 
<B>*are*</B> relevant to this mail list. 
306 to debate which method of changing light 
bulbs is superior, where to buy the best light bulbs, 
what brand of light bulbs work best for this 
technique, and what brands are faulty. 
27 to post URLs where one can see examples of 
different light bulbs 
14 to post that the URLs were posted incorrectly, and 
to post corrected URLs. 
3 to post about links they found from the URLs that 
are relevant to this list which makes light bulbs 
relevant to this list. 
33 to concatenate all posts to date, then quote 
them including all headers and footers, and then 
add "Me Too." 
12 to post to the list that they are unsubscribing 
because they cannot handle the light bulb 
controversey. 
19 to quote the "Me Too's" to say, "Me Three." 
4 to suggest that posters request the light bulb FAQ. 
1 to propose new alt.change.lite.bulb newsgroup. 
47 to say this is just what alt.physic.cold_fusion 
was meant for, leave it here. 
143 votes for alt.lite.bulb. 
<P>
[Note - making the list and newsgroups rounds in a big way, original 
author unknown - ed.]
