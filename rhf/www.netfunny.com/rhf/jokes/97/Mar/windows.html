 "What if Data (from "Star Trek, The Next Generation")
         were Microsoft Windows compatible?"
 
 WORF:  Captain, there are three Romulan warships uncloaking dead
 ahead.
 
 PICARD:  On screen.
 
 The main viewing screen changes to a pattern of horizontal lines,
 each only a single pixel wide.
 
 PICARD:  Data, what's wrong here?
 
 DATA: Captain, the main viewscreen does not have sufficient video
 memory to display an image of this size.  May I suggest that you
 select a lower resolution?
 
 PICARD:  Make it so.
 
 The screen blanks, and then an image appears, with big, blocky square
 pixels. Three objects appear in the center, which could be Romulan
 warbirds, but which actually look more like the aliens in Space
 Invaders.
 
 PICARD:  Data, open a hailing channel to the Romulans.
 
 DATA:  Aye, sir.
 
 Data picks up an hourglass from the floor beside him, turns it over,
 and places it on the console in front of him.  He punches some buttons
 on the console and sits motionless for several seconds.  A flash of
 light blossoms from one of the Romulan ships on the viewscreen.
 
 WORF:  Incoming plasma torpedo, Captain!
 
 PICARD:  Shields up!
 
 DATA:  I'm sorry, Captain, but I am still attempting to complete your
 last instruction.  I must ask you to wait until I have finished before
 you issue your next command.
 
 PICARD: What on earth do you mean?  Data, this is *important*!  I want
 those shields up *right now*.
 
 DATA:  I'm sorry, Captain, but I am still attempting to complete your
 last instruction.  I must ask you to wait until I have finished before
 you issue your next command.
 
 LAFORGE:  Allow me, captain.   to Data Control-alt-delete, Data.
 
 Data removes the hourglass from the console, and returns it to the
 floor.
 
 DATA:  The Romulans are not responding to my hails.  Press my nose to
 cancel and return to Windows.  Pull my left ear to close this
 communications channel which is not responding.  You will lose any
 information sent by the Romulans.
 
 LaForge pulls Data's left ear.
 
 PICARD:  Shields...
 
 There is a tremendous explosion.  The bridge shakes violently, and all
 the crew members are thrown to the floor.  A shower of sparks erupts
 from Wesley Crusher's station at the helm, throwing Wesley back away
 from the console.
 
 PICARD:  Up, Data!
 
 DATA:  Aye, sir.
 
 RIKER:  All decks, damage report!
 
 WORF:  Captain, Ensign Crusher is injured.  He appears to be
 unconscious.
 
 Data picks up the hourglass again, places it on his console, and
 punches some more buttons.  He waits a few seconds, then puts the
 hourglass back on the floor.
 
 DATA:  Shields are now up, captain.
 
 PICARD:  And not a moment too soon.  Worf, lock all phasers on the
 lead Romulan ship.
 
 WORF:  Aye, sir.   He punches buttons on the weapons console.
 
 PICARD:  Mr. Data, take the helm, and prepare for evasive action.
 
 DATA:  I am sorry, sir, but I do not have the proper device driver
 installed for that console.
 
 PICARD:  Well, damn it, install the right one.
 
 DATA:  Please insert Setup Implant  1 in my right nostril.
 
 PICARD:  Number One, where do we keep Data's setup implants?
 
 RIKER:  I left them with Geordi.
 
 LAFORGE: (in a surprised voice)  What!!?  I thought you still had
 them!
 
 PICARD:  Data, don't you have device drivers stored in your internal
 memory?
 
 DATA:  Not found, sir.  Please insert Setup Implant  1 in my right
 nostril.
 
 PICARD:  Data, I don't <b>have</b> Setup Implant  1.
 
 DATA:  Not ready reading right nostril.  Abort, Retry, Fail?
 
 PICARD:  Abort!
 
 DATA:  Not ready reading right nostril.  Abort, Retry, Fail?
 
 PICARD:  Well, fail, then!
 
 DATA:  Current nose is no longer valid.
 
 Data walks over to the helm, and presses several buttons.  The ship
 lurches, the images of the Romulan warships suddenly shift to one side
 of the viewscreen, and a high-pitched whining noise is heard coming
 from somewhere else in the ship.
 
 LAFORGE:  alarmed  Data, what the hell are you doing?
 
 PICARD:  Number One, do we have a customer service number for Data?
 
 RIKER:  Yes sir, but last time I tried to call them, I got put on hold
 for two hours before I was able to talk to anyone.  And that person
 wasn't knowledgeable about androids of Data's model.  She specialized
 in industrial control robots.
 
 Suddenly, the lights all go out, the viewscreen goes blank, and all
 the usual noise of fans, motors, and so on whines to a halt.  After a
 few seconds, the red emergency lights come on.  Data is standing by
 the console, absolutely motionless.
 
 PICARD:  What's going on?
 
 LAFORGE: (checking the helm console)  Lieutenant Data has caused a
 General Protection Violation in the warp engine core.
 
 PICARD: These androids look really sharp, but you can't really do
 anything with them.
 
 The shimmer of the transporter effect appears, and six Romulans in
 full battle dress materialize on the bridge.  A seventh figure, a
 Ferengi, appears moments later.
 
 FERENGI:   (with a mercenary grin) Can I interest you in a Macintosh,
 Captain?
