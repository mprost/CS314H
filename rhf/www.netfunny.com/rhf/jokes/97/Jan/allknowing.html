There is a thread about those supermarket "discount customer" cards 
in misc.consumer. Here's MY followup: 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Dear Mr. Jones: 
<P>
We noticed you've not picked up any condoms at SpiffyMart recently. 
(Your last purchase was 8 weeks ago.) Further, you have stopped 
buying feminine hygiene products, but have sharply increased 
your frozen pizza and dinners usage in the same time frame. 
<P>
It's clear that Ms. Jody Sanders has dumped you.  (It's probably 
for the best - we knew she was a loser from that cheap shampoo she 
buys.) We confirmed this with the Post Office database--yep, she 
filed a change of address. 
<P>
We at Horny International offer our condolences.  As the number-one 
vender of hot X-rated videos, we'd like to help you out in this 
time of stress. If you're feeling lonely, check out our catalog of 
both VHS and super 8 tapes. 
<P>
Order now and we throw in an extra tape FREE! 
<P>
Yours Truly; 
<P>
Sleazy Jerk, Marketing Manager. 
<P>
ps: That "blond" at O'Dougles last Saturday--you bought her 
2nd Strawberry Martini? Forget it! She's on her third yeast 
infection in as many months, and is a 'regular' at Acme Pharmacy. 
(Her HMO computer gossips with ours.) You never know what else she 
might have. Our tapes are LOTS safer!.. 
<P>
