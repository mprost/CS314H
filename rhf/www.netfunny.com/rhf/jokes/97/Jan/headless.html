<P>
I received this one from a girlfriend whose husband works at a mortuary. 
<P>
This woman goes into a funeral home to make arrangements 
for her husband's funeral.  She tells the director that she wants 
her husband to be buried in a dark blue suit. 
<P>
He asks, "Wouldn't it just be easier to bury him in the black 
suit that he's wearing?" 
<P>
But she insists that it must be a blue suit and gives him a blank 
check to buy one. 
<P>
When she comes back for the wake, she sees her husband in the 
coffin and he is wearing a beautiful blue suit.  She tells the 
director how much she loves the suit and asks how much it cost. 
He says, "Actually, it didn't cost anything.  The funniest thing 
happened.  As soon as you left, another corpse was brought in, 
this one wearing a blue suit.  I noticed that they were about the 
same size, and asked the other widow if she would mind if her 
husband were buried in a black suit.  She said that was fine with 
her. So... I switched the heads" 
<P>
