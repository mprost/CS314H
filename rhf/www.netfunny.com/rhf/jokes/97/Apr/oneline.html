<PRE>What follows are the latest entries in the one-liner file.  These are jokes
which are funny, but which didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post
such a digest whenever I have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly
selective readers will probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to
killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in the title - ed.

According to Reuters, Japan's Mitsubishi Electric plans to manufacture a color
television set which an also be used to surf the Internet.    The set will
allow users to watch television programs, exchange e-mail and browse the web
via the TV's built-in 32-bit CPU, WWW browser and modem.

Given the state of today's browser technology, this also means for the first
time that users will be able to crash their television sets.

This is original with me, except for the first sentence, which came
from a routine by Irish comic Niall MacCanna, broadcast on British TV
on Sep. 3rd.

-

Isn't it cruel that "dyslexia" is so hard to
spell? A dyslexic will often write the letters in
a word in the wrong order. So, if he wants to
write about his dyslexia, it might come out as
"Ever since I was a child I've had daily sex."
