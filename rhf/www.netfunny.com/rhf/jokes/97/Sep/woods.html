The Pope met with the College of Cardinals to discuss a proposal from 
Shimon Peres, the former leader of Israel. "Your holiness," said one of 
the Cardinals, "Mr. Peres wants to determine whether Jews or Catholics 
are superior, by challenging you to a golf match." The Pope was greatly 
disturbed, as he had never held a golf club in his life. 
<P>
"Not to worry," said the Cardinal, "we'll call America and talk to Jack 
Nicklaus. We'll make him a Cardinal, he can play Shimon Peres... We 
can't lose!" Everyone agreed it was a good idea. The call was made and, of 
course, Jack was honored and agreed to play. 
<P>
The day after the match, Nicklaus reported to the Vatican to inform the 
Pope of his success in the match. "I came in second, your Holiness," said 
Nicklaus. 
<P>
"Second?!!" exclaimed the surprised Pope. "You came in second to Shimon 
Peres?!!" 
<P>
"No," said Nicklaus, "second to Rabbi Woods."
