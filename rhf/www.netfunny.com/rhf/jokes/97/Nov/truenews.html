A couple of years ago I was invited to volunteer to work with the<BR>
youth programs at a large evangelical church. Because of the tight<BR>
security requirements, I had to sign a release form giving permission<BR>
to have a background check done on me. I also had to fill out an<BR>
application form that asked a number of very personal questions. This<BR>
wasn't a problem, since I had nothing to hide, until I got to the<BR>
following question:<BR>

"Have you ever been [cured] of sexual immorality?"<BR>
