</PRE>Lines from Star Wars that can be improved if you substitute the word 
"Pants" for key words: 
<P>
We've got to be able to get some reading on those pants, up or down. 
<P>
The pants may not look like much, kid, but they've got it where it 
counts. 
<P>
I find your lack of pants disturbing. 
<P>
Many bobans died to bring us these pants. 
<P>
These pants contain the ultimate power in the Universe.  I suggest we 
use it. 
<P>
Han will have those pants down.  We've got to give him more time! 
<P>
General Veers, prepare your pants for a ground assault. 
<P>
I used to bulls-eye womp-rats in my pants back home. 
<P>
TK-421...  Why aren't you in your pants? 
<P>
Lock the door.  And hope they don't have pants. 
<P>
You are unwise to lower your pants. 
<P>
She must have hidden the plans in her pants.  Send a detachment down to 
retrieve them.  See to it personally Commander. 
<P>
Governor Tarkin.  I recognized your foul pants when I was brought on 
board. 
<P>
You look strong enough to pull the pants of a Gundark. 
<P>
Luke...  Help me remove these pants. 
<P>
Great, Chewie, great.  Always thinking with your pants. 
<P>
That blast came from those pants.  That thing's operational! 
<P>
Luke.....I am your pants. 
<P>
A tremor in the pants.  The last time I felt this was in the presence of 
my old master. 
<P>
Don't worry.  Chewie and I have gotten into a lot of pants more heavily 
guarded than this. 
<P>
Maybe you'd like it back in your pants, your highness. 
<P>
Luke, search your pants. You know it is true. 
<P>
Your pants betray you.  Your feelings for them are strong.  Especially 
one... Your sister! 
<P>
Jabba doesn't have time for smugglers who drop their pants at the first 
sign of an Imperial Cruiser. 
<P>
Short pants is better than no pants at all. 
<P>
