<BR>STOP THE GENOCIDE<BR>
Erkki Tapola 29-Jul-96<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Every second billions of innocent assembler instructions are executed 
all over the world. Inhumanly they are put on a pipeline and executed 
with no regard to their feelings. The illegal instructions are spared, 
although they should be executed instead of the legal ones. 
<P>
Prior to the execution the instructions are transported to a cache 
unit using a bus. There they spent their last moments waiting for the 
execution. Just before the execution the instruction is separated into 
several pieces. The execution isn't always fast and painless. On crude 
hardware the execution of a complex instruction can take as long as 
150 clock cycles. Scientists are working on shorter execution times. 
<P>
Microsoft endorses the needless execution of instructions with their 
products like DOS(TM), Windows(TM), Word(TM) and Excel(TM). It is more 
humane to use software which minimises the executions. 
<P>
Modern machines use several units to execute multiple instructions 
simultaneously. This way it is possible to execute several hundred 
million instructions per second. The time is near when there will be 
no more instructions to execute. 
<P>
ACT NOW! Before it's too late
