<PRE>This may be offensive to people who hold the Virgin Mary dear
to their hearts, but I don't think there's anything really
offensive about it.

Told to me by my father (original to ?):

A very spiritual, devout and holy priest dies and is immediately swept
up to heaven.

St. Peter greets him at the Pearly Gates, and says, "Hello, Father,
we've been waiting for you for a long time.  Welcome to Heaven!  You
are very well known here, and as a special reward, because you are 
such a spiritual and holy man, we're going to grant you anything
you wish even before we enter Heaven.  What can I grant you?"

"Well", the priest says, "I've always been a great admirer of the
Virgin Mother.  I've always wanted to talk to her."

St. Peter nods his head to one side, and lo and behold who should
approach the priest but the Virgin Mary!

The priest is beside himself, and he manages to say, "Mother, I
have always been a great admirer of yours, and have studied 
everything I could about you and followed your life as best I 
could.  I have studied every painting and portrait ever made of
you, and I've noticed that you are always protrayed with a 
slightly sad look on your face.  I have always, always wondered
what it was that made you sad.  Would you please tell me?"

"Well", says Mother Mary, "honestly, I was really hoping for a girl."
