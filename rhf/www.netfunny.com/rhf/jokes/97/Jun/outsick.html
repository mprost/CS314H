<PRE>Heard this one on the bus...


A fellow stopped at a rural petrol station and, after filling his tank, he paid
the bill and bought a soft drink.  He stood by his car to drink his cola and
he watched a couple of men working along the roadside.  One man would dig a
hole two or three feet deep and then move on.  The other man came along
behind and filled in the hole.  While one was digging a new hole, the other
was about 25 feet behind filling in the old.  The men worked right past the
fellow with the soft drink and went on down the road. "I can't stand this,"
said the man tossing the can in a trash container and heading down the road
toward the men.

"Hold it, hold it," he said to the men.  "Can you tell me what's going on
here with this digging?"

"Well, we work for the county, " one of the men said.

"But one of you is digging a hold and the other fills it up.  You're not
accomplishing anything.  Aren't you wasting the county's money?"

"You don't understand, mister," one of the men said, leaning on his shovel
and wiping his brow. "Normally there's three of us--me, Rodney and Mike.  I
dig the hole, Rodney sticks in the tree and Mike here puts the dirt back.

Now just because Rodney's sick, that don't mean that Mike and me can't
work."
