</PRE>A local United Way office realized that it had never received a 
donation from the town's most successful lawyer. The person in charge 
of contributions called him to persuade him to contribute. "Our 
research shows that out of a yearly income of at least $500,000, you 
give not a penny to charity. Wouldn't you like to give back to the 
community in some way?" 
<P>
The lawyer mulled this over for a moment and replied, "First, did our 
research also show that my mother is dying after a long illness, and 
has medical bills that are several times her annual income?" 
<P>
Embarrassed, the United Way rep mumbled, "Um...no." 
<P>
"--or that my brother, a disabled veteran, is blind and confined to a 
wheelchair?"  The stricken United Way rep began to stammer out an 
apology but was interrupted, "--or that my sister's husband died in a 
traffic accident," the lawyer's voice rising in indignation, "leaving 
her penniless with three children?!" 
<P>
The humiliated United Way rep, completely beaten, said simply, "I had 
no idea..." 
<P>
On a roll, the lawyer cut him off once again: "--so if I don't give 
any money to them, why should I give any to you?!?" 
<P>
