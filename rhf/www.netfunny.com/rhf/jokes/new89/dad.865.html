It was the 1st day of school.  The 2nd grade teacher 
asked some of her students to tell the class a story 
of something that had happened to them over the summer 
break in which they learned a moral. 
<P>
The first student stood up and said, "Well, I went to 
my father's farm, and one day we counted the eggs in 
the chicken coupe to see how many chicks we would get, 
but that night a wolf came and ate 1/2 of the eggs. 
The moral I learned was don't count your chickens 
before they're hatched." 
<P>
"Very good," said the teacher. 
<P>
The second student stood up and said, "Well, one day 
my mother sent me to the market to get some milk, and 
on my way home, I got beat up by the neighbor bully who 
spilled my milk all over the ground.  I went home crying 
to my mother. And she said not to cry over spilled milk." 
<P>
"Very good," said the teacher. 
<P>
The third student stood up and said, "My father told me 
one of his war stories, and it went like this:  He was 
stranded in a fox hole with only one bottle of Jack Daniels, 
12 rounds of ammo, and 2 grenades.  Well he drank the 
whiskey, then the enemy came.  He shot up 12 guys, and 
blew up 20 more with the grenades." 
<P>
"Well, what moral could you have possibly have gotten 
from such a story?" asked the teacher. 
<P>
"Don't fuck with my dad when he's drunk."
