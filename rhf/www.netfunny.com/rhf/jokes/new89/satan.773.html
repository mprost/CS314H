Resent-From: Charles Forsythe &lt;convex!forsythe@uxc.cso.uiuc.edu&gt; 
<P>
This was sent to me by Linda Branagan--Convex doc. writer and Connie Dobbs 
look-alike.  I think its an excellent illustration of why "Bob" began his 
mission in Dallas. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The following is a true story. 
<P>
Last week I walked into a local "home style cookin' restaurant/watering hole" 
to pick up a take out order.   I spoke briefly to the waitress behind the 
counter, who told me my order would be done in a few minutes. 
<P>
So, while I was busy gazing at the farm implements hanging on the walls, I was 
approached by two, uh, um... well, let's call them "natives."  These guys 
might just be the <B>original</B> Texas rednecks--complete with ten-gallon hats, 
snakeskin boots and the pervasive odor of cheap beer and whiskey. 
<P>
"Pardon us, ma'am.  Mind of we ask you a question?" 
<P>
Well, people keep telling me that Texans are real friendly, so I 
nodded. 
<P>
"Are you a Satanist?" 
<P>
Well, at least they didn't ask me if I liked to party. 
<P>
"Uh, no, I can't say that I am." 
<P>
"Gee ma'am.  Are you <B>sure</B> about that?" they asked. 
<P>
I put on my biggest, brightest Dallas Cowboys cheerleader smile and said, "No, 
I'm positive.  The closest I've ever come to Satanism is watching Geraldo." 
<P>
"Hmm.  Interesting. See, we was just wondering why it is you have the lord of 
darkness on your chest there." 
<P>
I was this close to slapping one of them and causing a scene--then I 
stopped and noticed the T-shirt I happened to be wearing that day.  Sure 
enough, it had a picture of a small, devilish looking creature that has for 
quite some time now been associated with a certain operating system.  In this 
particular representation, the creature was wearing sneakers. 
<P>
They continued: "See, ma'am, we don't exactly <B>appreciate</B> it when people show 
off pictures of the devil. Especially when he's lookin' so friendly." 
<P>
These idiots sounded terrifyingly serious. 
<P>
Me: "Oh, well, see, this isn't really the devil, it's just, well, it's sort of 
a mascot." 
<P>
Native: "And what kind of football team has the devil as a mascot?" 
<P>
Me: "Oh, it's not a team.  It's an operating-- uh, a kind of computer." 
<P>
I figured that an ATM machine was about as much technology as these guys could 
handle, and I knew that if I so much as uttered the word "unix" I would only 
make things worse. 
<P>
Native: "Where does this satanical computer come from?" 
<P>
Me: "California.  And there's nothing satanical about it really." 
<P>
Somewhere along the line here, the waitress has noticed my predicament--but 
these guys probably outweighed her by 600 pounds, so all she did was look at 
me sympathetically and run off into the kitchen. 
<P>
Native: "Ma'am, I think you're lying.  And we'd appreciate it if you'd leave 
the premises now." 
<P>
Fortunately, the waitress returned that very instant with my order, and they 
agreed that it would be okay for me to actually pay for my food before I left. 
While I was at the cash register, they amused themselves by talking to each 
other. 
<P>
Native #1: "Do you think the police know about these devil computers?" 
<P>
Native #2: "If they come from California, then the FBI oughta know about 
'em." 
<P>
They escorted me to the door.  I tried one last time: "You're really blowing 
this all out of proportion.  A lot of people use this `kind of computers.' 
Universities, researchers, businesses.  They're actually very useful." 
<P>
Big, big, BIG mistake.  I should have guessed at what came next. 
<P>
Native: "Does the government use these devil computers?" 
<P>
Me: "Yes." 
<P>
Another BIG boo-boo. 
<P>
Native: "And  does the government <B>pay</B> for 'em? With <B>our</B> tax dollars?" 
<P>
I decided that it was time to jump ship. 
<P>
Me: "No.  Nope.  Not at all.  You're tax dollars never entered the picture at 
all.  I promise.  No sir, not a penny. Our good Christian congressmen would 
never let something like that happen.  Nope.  Never. Bye." 
<P>
Texas.  What a country. 
<P>
