A nun and a priest were traveling across the desert and 
realized halfway across that the camel they were using for transportation 
was about to die. They set up a make-shift camp, hoping someone would 
come to their rescue, but to no avail. Soon the camel died. 
<P>
After several days of not being rescued, they agreed that 
they were not going to be rescued. They prayed a lot (of course), and 
they discussed their predicament in great depth. 
<P>
Finally the priest said to the nun, "You know, Sister, I am 
about to die, and there's always been one thing I've wanted here on 
earth--to see a woman naked. Would you mind taking off your clothes 
so I can look at you?" 
<P>
The nun thought about his request for several seconds and 
then agreed to take off her clothes. As she was doing so, she remarked, 
"Well, Father, now that I think about it, I've never seen a man naked, 
either. Would you mind taking off your clothes, too?" 
<P>
With little hesitation, the priest also stripped. Suddenly the 
nun exclaimed, "Father! What is that little thing hanging between your 
legs?" 
<P>
The priest patiently answered, "That, my child, is a gift from 
God. If I put it in you, it creates a new life." 
<P>
"Well," responded the nun, "forget about me. Stick it in the 
camel!"
