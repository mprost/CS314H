<STRONG>[Ed: I wrote this, but David sent it in--I don't do my own stuff 
unless other people prompt it.  It was prompted by the slew of silly 
suggestions on how to deal with the question of whether aquariums are a 
science or a hobby.]</STRONG> 
<P>
Here's a better idea.  When an idea for a new group comes up, we should 
have a vote on who gets to propose it.  After that is decided, we can vote 
on who gets to pick the names.  Then we'll get a list of names, and 
use 'New Zealand' voting rules.  Under NZ rules, (OK!) each person gets 8 
votes.  They use 2-4 votes on the name they like most, 1-4 votes on the 
2nd best name and so on.  In addition, you get 8 negative votes for names 
you don't like.  In the end, the vote totals are multipied by rand() and 
the one closest to e^sqrt(pi) is the winner. 
<P>
Once a name has been decided, we vote on whether we want the group or not. 
At the end, we vote on whether there should be a 5 day cooling-period after 
the vote, and if so, the duration of the period, if not to be five, is 
decided by New Zealand rules.  If the group champion wishes to go to the 
bathroom, he or she must conduct a vote lasting 14 to 30 days to decide if it 
is to be #1 or #2. 
<P>
Finally, if it is decided that the group is to be created, and the group 
champion has not yet exploded, the group champion can send a request for 
a newgroup to wouldnot@ncar.ucar.edu.  If the people on that list like the 
group, they will create it.  If they do, each admin can then decide, as they 
wish, whether to carry and/or forward the group on their own machine.  But 
otherwise the vote is binding.  (Unless a vote declares it to be non-binding) 
<P>
