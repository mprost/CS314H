<P>
I should state that Ronald MacDonald is probably a registered 
trademark of the MacDonald's Restaurant Corporation of 
America or something. 
<P>
I recently saw an advertisement for MacDonalds.  In it, a young 
girl is talking to Ronald MacDonald.  The setting is somewhere 
in North America, most likely, judging from the accents and 
scenery.  The girl says she's running away to MacDonaldLand, 
and Ronald says, "MacDonaldland?  That's where I'm from." 
<P>
Suddenly, it all made sense.  Why is Ronald MacDonald, the 
grotesquely made-up and attired being, so far from MacDonaldland, 
the only place where he could fit in?  Obviously, he's in exile. 
<P>
A few years ago in MacDonaldLand, Mayor McCheese, having grown 
paranoid and megalomaniacal in his years secluded in his 
mayoral residence, declared a state of emergency.  He rationalized 
this act by pointing out increased felonious activities by the 
Hamburgler, and obliquely referring to rumors that those French-Fry 
Weasels (whose names I forget) were carrying some sort of disease. 
Mayor McCheese's brother, the police officer with a similarly 
hamburger-shaped head (whose name I also forget), rounded up the 
Hamburgler, the Hamburgler's family, business associates of the 
Hamburgler, the French-Fry Weasels, and any life forms in MacDonaldLand 
who veered too much from basic hamburger-humanoid form.  These 
purges were justified by a new theory of eugenics, which stated that 
large, round, flat heads with lettuce in them are signs of a higher 
form of life, a sort of Hamburgerubermensch, who were divinely 
granted sole political power of MacDonaldLand.  Obviously, Ronald 
MacDonald, not being a Hamburgerubermensch, did not fit it, and yet 
the people would not accept his execution, since he was beloved by 
all and besides his great-grandfather, Helmut MacDonald, founded 
MacDonaldLand, so instead of being killed or forced to work in the 
salt mines with the other victims of the purges or being ground 
into a paste and turned into Big Macs for sale abroad, he was exiled 
to the United States, due to the friendly relations the United States 
had always had with MacDonaldLand, a result of the tireless efforts of 
the US Ambassador to MacDonaldLand, Ray A. Kroc. 
<P>
But then, why would Ronald MacDonald just casually try to talk 
the young girl out of running away to MacDonaldLand, instead of 
sternly warning her against the dangers there?  Obviously, he 
harbors a great resentment against Americans.  Perhaps he is 
angry that we did not intervene and stop the human rights abuses 
perpetrated by Mayor McCheese (after all, the declaration of 
a state of emergency did happen during the Reagan Presidency), 
or perhaps he's just a snob.  "Stupid Americans!" he mutters 
to himself at night, as he sits at his formica table while drinking 
cheap coffee and reading the only MacDonaldLand-language newspaper 
printed in the U.S., "they dress like fools!  Drab colors...no 
bright yellow smocks or oversized red shoes...and like barbarians, 
they do not paint their faces!  When I show them the sign of 
the arches, they stare at me as if I'd gone mad!  Were they 
educated with pigs?"  Late at night, he hangs around the mini- 
playgrounds built outside of MacDonald's franchises.  "It is, 
so little," he whispers, before taking a swig of bourbon from 
a bottle he thinks he's hiding in a paper bag, "but it reminds 
me of home."
