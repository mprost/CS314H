Here's the transcript of my recent communication to Bigelow, inspired by a 
sampling of their atrocious  "I Love Lemon Herb Tea." 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Dear Sirs, 
<P>
I am writing to complain about the performance of one of your products, to 
wit: Bigelow I Love Lemon Herb Tea.  Having recently sampled said item in a 
culinary context, I am convinced that it is the most unappealing, tasteless, and 
unprofessional tea I have ever encountered. 
<P>
Each teabag is enveloped in a package that reads "A year-round valentine 
for everyone who really loves lemon."  Well, I happen to be an ardent 
enthusiast for that particular flavor, and I can assure you that this alleged 
tea tastes less like lemon than most electric home appliances.  The only way 
this substance could be considered a "year-round valentine" is by taking the 
meaning of "valentine" as "a heart," which, if left out in the open for a 
year, would be encrusted with congealed blood and covered with small, 
creeping insects. 
<P>
This tea breaks all previously-conceived boundaries of the concept bland.  It 
invokes in the drinker a level of excitement usually associated with shoelace 
collections or counting one's own armpit hairs.  I notice that the tea is 
classified as as "Herb Tea" rather than an "Herbal Tea," and that Herb has 
traditionally been a name denoting banal, tedious people. Another tumbler of 
the Bigelow corporate lock falls into place. 
<P>
The outer wrapper of the teabag - whose taste may be compared favorably to 
that of the tea itself - is colored yellow.  One may conjecture that this 
represents some twisted attempt to conjure associations with other objects 
that R.C. Bigelow, Inc. regards as the paradigm of tastiness, such as fire 
hydrants, old math textbooks, and yield signs.  A quick glance at the 
packages of some of your other herbal tea products confirms our suspicions. 
One tea package depicts a small cat, playfully clawing a ball or mouse or 
small child, while your propagandistic legend assures us the paragon of 
beverages is contained within.  What sort of baldfaced nonsequitor is this? 
The only thing a cat and tea have in common is that one dislikes being 
immersed in the other.  Clearly, your marketing skills are equivalent to your 
prowess at teamaking, which is probably on level with the cat's. 
<P>
In short, I find I Love Lemon Herb Tea a thoroughly detestable product, and 
recommend changing its name to I Used To Love Lemon Until I Drank This Herb 
Tea.  In view of its exceeding worthlessness as a viable drink, it is difficult 
not to inductively extend this condemnation to include the entire product line 
of R.C. Bigelow, Inc.  However, if I were sent a free sample of each of your 
other tea products, I might be able to constrain my loathing to this 
particular specimen, and not gallop through the streets of Pittsburgh howling 
obscenities about your company and your activities, which, as you know, it 
exceedingly deleterious to healthy public relations. 
<P>
Sincerely, 
<P>
Michael Shapiro 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
They responded promptly, within a week: 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Dear Mr. Shapiro: 
<P>
I must say your letter was one of the more descriptive letters we have 
received.  It is always unfortunate when ever we have a dissatisfied consumer 
and normally we will send them free coupons in order to try and better 
satisfy their needs with many of our other products.  However, in your case I 
feel you have reached a point of no return.  My only recommendation to you is 
try Celestial Seasonings, they offer a very nice lemon tea.  Perhaps they will 
have better luck pleasing you. 
<P>
Thank you for taking the time to share with us your tremendous displeasure. 
We continually try to improve our products, and each letter does mean a great 
deal to us. 
<P>
Sincerely, 
<P>
<BR>Ms. Bigelow<BR>
Operations Manager<BR>
<P>
</PRE><P>

<P>
The letter was accompanied by a generous portion of No Tea.  I was rather 
hoping that they'd send me a sample. 
<P>
The irony is that I'm actually very fond of Bigelow tea products.  I really 
just wanted to see what they'd say. 
<P>
