<PRE>
Due to the large number of Branch Davidian jokes,
I'm putting out this special issue.  For those of
you unaware of the situation, this religious group's
compound was consumed by fire recently, ending a
long siege by US Federal agents.

Obviously, most of these jokes are in the "sick" or
"offensive" category.  You've been warned.

Original jokes are so designated.

From: MSINCLAI@drew.drew.edu (Matthew Sinclair)

[My brother, a currency trader in NYC, told me this one; he heard it on the 
trading floor soon after the burning of the Branch Dravidian's compund was 
first reported.]

What does Waco stand for?

What a cook out!

Subject: What happened in Waco - history as theatre
From: oaf@martigny.ai.mit.edu (Oded Feingold)
Keywords: topical, original, smirk, sick, religion
Approved: funny@clarinet.com

The events in Waco could have been foreseen, had anyone in the FBI
understood that David Koresh was encapsulating Jewish history.

First they re-enacted Passover, then there was the re-enactment of the
Warsaw ghetto uprising.

Subject: Blaze of Glory
From: hitz@cuhhca.hhmi.columbia.edu (Ben Hitz)
Keywords: topical, original, smirk, religion

Sadly enough, I made this one up:

Well, since the traditional 45 minute mourning period has passed,
it's time for:

BAD WACO ONE LINERS!

These are originals, thought up on the drive to work this morning:

A: Because of their contribution to global warming.

Q: Did you hear that David Koresh lost his job as the second messiah?
A: He got fired.

Q: Did you hear about the tragedy at Waco?
A: Evidently an NBC News crew was trying to move in for a close-up...

Q: Did you know that Ranch Apocalypse had an Internet connection?
A: Yes, and Koresh's last news post started: "Feel free to flame me, but..."

This is too easy...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: Oops! Sorry about that!
From: mjassels@cs.concordia.ca (Michael Assels)

I bet the Branch Davidians were really surprised when they
woke up in Hell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: Another WACO Acronym
From: edg@netcom.com (Ed Greenberg)
Keywords: topical, original, smirk, religion

WACO:  We're A Combustible Organization

From: john@chance.gts.org (John R MacMillan)
