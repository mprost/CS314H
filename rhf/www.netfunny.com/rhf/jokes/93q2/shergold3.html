<PRE>
I just heard a tragic tale on the radio.  I'd like to help out, and I'm
sure all of you would too so I'm trying to send this to as many people
as I can.

The tale revolves around two humor moderators, Brad Templeton and Maddi
Hausmann.  They're both afflicted with a sense of humor for which there
is no present cure.  Their big goal in life is to collect as many jokes
as possible and get in the Guiness Book of World Records that way.

Now I know you'll all want to help them achieve this goal, so please,
send as many jokes as you can to funny@clarinet.com.  They particularly
want to receive anything related to "mouse balls," dyslexic agnostics,
Iraqi driver's ed, Administratium, strings in bars and bell-ringers.

The doctors aren't sure how long they have to live, so don't delay and
send your jokes now!  Also, please forward this to as many people as you
can.  One of my friends got this request and didn't forward it.  The
next day he lost his job.  A week later he forwarded it to some people
and now he has his job back with a raise!  Good luck is sure to come to
all those who help Maddi and Brad.
