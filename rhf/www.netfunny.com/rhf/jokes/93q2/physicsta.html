<PRE>As physics TAs, we often read funny answers to physics questions.  We then 
compile them for the amusement of all.  If you wish to flame me about how poor
a teacher I <b>MUST</b> be, please be aware that NONE of the responses given below
are from my students. 

When asked to state 2 of Newton's 3 Laws of Motion, students responded:


	If an object is at rest and a force acts upon it, it is then in motion.
But if an object is already in motion, and a force acts upon it, then it is
not moving.

Law 3-If a force is put on a object which does not move the object will give 
      back an equal opposite force.

Law 1-A mass which is at rest will remain at rest, and an mass which is in     
      motion will remain moving in a straight line if not interfered with.

An object in motion will remain in motion until acted upon by an out side force.
Remain at rest until acted upon.
 

A force acting on an object needs an equal force reacting on the object to keep
the object in place.

A system always moves toward a lower state of energy.

An object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an opposite force.

An object in motion will remain in motion unless a force is acted upon it, and 
an objcet will remain at rest until a force is acted upon it.

1.  A Law that everything that moves has an opposite attraction to it (something
    is always pulling at it)

2.  What ever the mass of an object on the earth, it applies to outer space
    (mass doesn't change).


These students were also asked to define "Work":

how much time and power it takes to do something

Work is equal to the amount of force done on which the displacement is going

A force put on an object to move it a certain displacement

The ability to use energy
