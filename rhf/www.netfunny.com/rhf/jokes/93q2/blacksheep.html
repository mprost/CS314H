An old joke, so old I don't remember the source - sorry :) 
<P>
There was this white missionary working in the jungles of Africa with a 
local tribe there. 
<P>
One day the wife of the tribe's chief got pregnant and eventually 
gave birth. The Chief was utterly shocked when he found out that 
the baby was a white boy. He was really confused so he decided to 
pay a visit to the missionary. 
<P>
"Father, my wife gave birth to a baby" 
<P>
"Why, that's a very good news, Chief. Congrats" 
<P>
"But Father, it is a white boy!?!?!?" 
<P>
The missionary thinks for sometime and in a deep voice replies, 
"Well Chief, sometimes nature does work in some strange ways.... 
The other day I was taking a stroll along the mountain side 
and I saw this beautiful black sheep in a herd of white 
sheep.." 
<P>
The Chief looked very surprised and was silent for a moment 
before he spoke, 
<P>
"Okay Father, here's the deal. You tell no one, and I'll tell 
no one." 
<P>
