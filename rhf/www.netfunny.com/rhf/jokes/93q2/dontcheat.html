<PRE>The Finals Week item, with 50 things to do during a final you
know you will flunk, inspires me to pass along this true story from
RIT.  Acknowledgements are due my colleague Ken Reek, and former
graduate student Ed Ford, who together pulled the scam off with
aplomb.

Several years ago, Ken was assigned two sections of a large service
course taken primarily by business students.  The final exam was
multiple choice, and had a well-deserved reputation for being easy to
cheat on (one proctor, 250-300 students).  Ken was determined to plug
this hole, at least for one term.

One nice thing about such a large class is that no student knows
everyone else who is enrolled.  Using this, Ken asked Ed to attend the
final and pretend to take it like everyone else.  Ken also told Ed to
be as blatent as possible about cheating.

At the start of the exam, Ken announced that anyone caught cheating
off another student's paper would have his or her exam confiscated and
would fail the course.  As the exam progressed, Ed was peering all
around, while Ken periodically called out "eyes on your own paper."
After about three such warnings, Ken bounded up the stairs, crossed to
Ed's seat, grabbed the exam, tore it to shreds, and shouted "You're
outta here!"  According to Ken, Ed's facial expression was a perfect
combination of shock and terror.

For the rest of the exam, the room resembled a monastery where monks
were carefully and studiously working on sacred scrolls.
