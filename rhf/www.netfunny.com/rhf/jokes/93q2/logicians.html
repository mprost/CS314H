Heard at 1992 Europ. Summer Meeting of Assn. of Symb. Logic. Author unknown.

1. A logician saves the life of a space alien and is rewarded with an offer to
answer any question. After a thought he asks: What is the best question to ask
and the correct answer to it? After a brief panic the alien consults her
computer and says: The best question to ask is the one you just did and the
correct answer to it is the one I gave.

2. In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice.
 But, in practice, there is.

3. Profound Truth differs from simple truth in that the negation of a simple
truth is a simple falsehood, while the negation of a Profound Truth may be
another Profound Truth. E.g. a button with "Life is just as simple as it seems"
on one side and "Life is not as simple as it seems" on the other.

I found this while preparing class for my graduate students:

[figure of a tree of numbers looking roughly like the following]
    
          0,0
       1,0   0,1
     2,0  1,1  0,2
   3,0  2,1  1,2  0,3
  ...  ... ... ... ...

"We will often refer to this object, which we will freely call a tree,
although it isn't, calling the levels |A| &lt; [aleph-null] the finite
part (although it is infinite), and the set of pairs ([aleph-null]a,
x) (for certain a) a diagonal (although its geometrical properties are
not those of a straight line)."

from Kees van Deemter (1985) "Quantifiers:  Finite vs. Infinite", in
J. van Bentham and A. ter Meulen _Generalized Quantifiers in Natural
Language_
