</PRE>In our R&amp;D department, persons are required to request the use of any IP 
addresses for testing before configuring their device with it.  Normally this 
is a straightforward process of ensuring nobody else is using the desired 
address.  Of course some people around here like to re-define normal! 
<P>
The following is an email conversation I saw earlier today: 
[I have assigned random names to protect the guilty] 
<P>
<BR>***********************<BR>
&gt;From: Stephan<BR>
&gt;Subject: IP 192.168.1.153<BR>
This is an email requesting the official use of 192.168.1.153 for SNMP test.<BR>
<P>
Please direct me to the proper place where I can use/buy this address for<BR>
testing.<BR>
<P>
Thank you for your help.<BR>
<P>

&gt;From: Al H.<BR>
&gt;Subject: RE: IP 192.168.1.153<BR>
Hi...<BR>
<P>
Congratulations! You are the proud new owner of an IP address, 192.168.1.153 .<BR>
<P>
Accounting has been notified, and payment will be via payroll deduction. Please<BR>
keep your receipt for exchange/refund/tax purposes.<BR>
<P>
***********************<BR>
&gt;From: Stephan<BR>
&gt;Subject: RE: IP 192.168.1.153<BR>
<P>
What kind of negotiation is that? Forwarding that request off to payroll.  Is<BR>
it kinda of like "you touch it you bought it?" You haven't even heard my bid<BR>
price for it.  I was hoping to get this one cheap.  I have been testing it out,<BR>
and it appears to ping slower than the other ones you gave me.  I think it is<BR>
fairly used and I was wondering what type of a warranty comes with it?  Also,<BR>
what is the trade in value of the other IP's I have, out of curiosity, if I<BR>
should no longer need them.<BR>
<P>
Thanks<BR>
<P>

<P>
Hi...<BR>
<P>
I don't remember using the word 'negotiation'... Your original email did not<BR>
specify an offered price, only a willingness to 'use/buy' the address - and<BR>
this aint no library kid! This is big business!! By using the address already,<BR>
you've implicitly agreed to the purchase/usage agreement, which explicitly<BR>
states that exchanges and refunds will only be considered <B>before</B> additional<BR>
usage takes place.<BR>
<P>
That address was previously owned by a little old lady who only downloaded<BR>
bondage .gifs on Sundays, so it had low milage, and besides - it worked *just<BR>
fine* before you started using it.<BR>
<P>
We're in the business of <B>providing</B> IP addresses, not buying them, so if *you*<BR>
don't want <B>your</B> IP addresses anymore, you can check with your co-workers to<BR>
see if they want to buy it from you - but I'll warn you up front, the resale<BR>
value on them isn't great!<BR>
<P>

Al H.,<BR>
<P>
It seems that you have now further devalued the worth of 192.168.1.153 by<BR>
attaching a dirty porn reference to it and passing it around the email<BR>
group (and you said it was hardly USED).  This should be further cause to<BR>
dicount this one, not to mention the fact that it isn't even a full ip<BR>
address.  Next time i'll apply for a broadcast address, or at least one<BR>
that contains bits closer to 255.<BR>
<P>
***********************<BR>
&gt;From the Law Firm of Dewey, Cheatham and Howe:<BR>
<P>
Dear Sir;<BR>
My client wishes to inform you that pursuant to the transaction that has<BR>
occurred between yourself and my client, my client has fulfilled all aspects of<BR>
the purchase/usage agreement by providing you with the address you requested,<BR>
in a timely fashion, which you implicitly agreed to by using said address.<BR>
At that point, <B>you</B> (the purchasor and new owner of said address) became<BR>
completely and wholly responsible for said address as well as all references<BR>
and usages of said address, and discussions regarding said address. My client<BR>
is no longer responsible for, nor will he accept any further responsibility<BR>
for any problems with said address. It was delivered when requested - as<BR>
requested. It was your (the purchasor) responsibility to verify the pedigree<BR>
and suitability of said address before the transaction was entered into.<BR>
<P>
Your claim that "it isn't even a full ip address" is incorrect (as can be<BR>
confirmed by any approved regulatory agency), and borders on libelous. Trust<BR>
us, we know, we're lawyers.<BR>
<P>
***********************<BR>
&gt; From the law firm of Hewey, Duwey, and Lewey:<BR>
<P>
Dir Sir;<BR>
<P>
Pursuant to your recent transaction and email exchange with our client we<BR>
have been contracted to represent Stephan in the matter of "Stephan vs Al H.."<BR>
Although we have been given full authority to pursue this matter in a court<BR>
of law, we feel that you will see the benefits of reaching a settlement<BR>
agreement which is satifactory to all parties concerned.<BR>
<P>
To assist in clarifying your current situation in this matter, we submit<BR>
the documents attached below for your review.  As you will note, sufficient<BR>
evidence is present for a judgement in the favor of our client.<BR>
<P>
[Document 09453B-1999-06-02]<BR>
<P>
To whom it may concern:<BR>
<P>
I feel that I must come to the defense of Stephan in this blatant example of<BR>
"Used Car Saleman Syndrome" which Al H. has fell victum too.<BR>
<P>
Reportedly the IP address in question is to be considered to be in "good<BR>
working condition" where infact I have evidence to the contrary!  A simple<BR>
search of the Software Problem Database will return numerous examples of<BR>
cases where this specific address has been subjected to a variety of<BR>
abusive tests; including subnet masking, ICMP redirects, network<BR>
unreachables and other torturous proceedures.<BR>
<P>
In a few documented cases it even states that the device configured with<BR>
the IP address 198.169.1.153 would not respond to pings, telnets, or any<BR>
other form of IP based queries.  This further supports Stephan's case that<BR>
the requested IP address can not be considered to be in good working order.<BR>

MEMORANDUM<BR>
&gt;From: Office of R&amp;D Internal Affairs.<BR>
To: [source unpublished at this time]<BR>
<P>
Dear Sir,<BR>
<P>
With respect to your request for a background check on one Al H., regarding<BR>
past and present IP address transactions, please be aware that this<BR>
individual is under current investigation for IP Address Fraud.  An<BR>
transactions entered into with this individual should be approached with<BR>
EXTREME CAUTION.<BR>
<P>
With regard to your question as to the integrity of Al H., interviews with<BR>
several co-workers have uncovered facts which indicate that he is the Boss<BR>
of the local IP address black market.  Reviews of log books has show<BR>
repeated resale of the same addresses.  Inspection of the local intranet<BR>
web site has shown how Al H. controls IP address and assigns them to<BR>
co-workers in return for "special favors."<BR>
<P>
In your request you mention Al H.'s suggestion that the addresses have<BR>
little or know resale value.  This office believes that this is simply an<BR>
attempt by Al H. to re-gain control of abandoned addresses so as to benefit<BR>
&gt;From their resale to future unsuspecting clients.<BR>
<P>
I would suggest that you immediately contact the local R&amp;D Consumer<BR>
Protection branch before any monies is transferred.<BR>
<P>
-----<BR>
<P>
Regarding the question of the validity of the claim "it isn't even a full<BR>
ip address" as presented in the letter from your legal representative:<BR>
<P>
Please note that the mentioned approved regulatory agency also states that<BR>
a full valid IP address must include a subnet mask!  Failure on your part<BR>
to provide this required information in the afore mentioned transaction<BR>
with our client provides the basis for Breach of Contract as per Article<BR>
2.01 "Genuine Intention" under the Contractual Law Act.<BR>
<P>
Lastly we must inform you that we are currently pursing a Court Injuction<BR>
to prevent an futher transaction of the afore mentioned type until this<BR>
issue is settled to our clients satisfactions.<BR>
<P>
Regards,<BR>
<P>
***********************<BR>
<P>
To the law firm of Hewey, Duwey, and Lewey:<BR>
<P>
My client suggests that a law firm with your professed reputation would be<BR>
able to afford not only a spell-checker, but also a clue-checker.<BR>
<P>
Please provide <B>concrete</B> examples of the test documents you refer to, or the<BR>
*shoe* will be on the other foot in terms of liability, and your 'organization'<BR>
*will be swimming* in stacks of legal red-tape. Our organization has<BR>
successfully represented many groups, including one from Marine Land known only<BR>
as *the fishes*.<BR>
<P>
Let me dummy it down a notch for you: We successfully represented New York's<BR>
'Teflon Don' until he refused to pay his bill, at which point he was reminded<BR>
that non-stick items should not come into contact with sharp metal objects.<BR>
<P>
Pursuant to your obviously mis-informed arguments regarding this matter, and<BR>
your libelous characterization of my client, I'm reminded of the case of 'My<BR>
Uncle Vinny's Foot Vs Your Butt'.<BR>
