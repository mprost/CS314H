</PRE>Next time you think you have had a bad day at work, think about this guy... 
Brian is a commercial saturation diver for Global Divers out of Louisiana 
and performs underwater repairs on offshore drilling rigs. Below is an email 
he sent to his sister. Anytime you think you have had a bad day at the 
office, remember this letter....True story. 
<P>
<BR>April 1998<BR>
Hi Sue,<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Just another note from your bottom dwelling brother. Last week I had a bad 
day at the office. Before I can tell you what happened to me, I first must 
bore you with a few technicalities of my job. As you know my office lies 
at the bottom of the sea. I wear a suit to the office. It's a wetsuit.  This 
time of year the water is quite cool.  So what we do to keep warm is this: 
<P>
We have a diesel powered industrial water heater. This $20,000 piece of shit 
sucks the water out of the sea. It heats it to a delightful temp.  It then 
pumps it down to the diver through a garden hose which is taped to the air 
hose. Now this sounds like a damn good plan, and I've used it several times 
with no complaints. What I do, when I get to the bottom and start working, 
is I take the hose and stuff it down the back of my neck. This floods my 
whole suit with warm water. It's like working in a Jacuzzi. 
<P>
Everything was going well until all of a sudden, my ass started to itch. 
So, of course, I scratched it. This only made things worse. Within a few 
seconds my ass started to burn. I pulled the hose out from my back, but the 
damage was done. In agony I realized what had happened.  The hot water 
machine had sucked up a jellyfish and pumped it into my suit.  This is even 
worse than the poison ivy you once had under a cast. Now I had that hose 
down my back. I don't have any hair on my back, so the jellyfish couldn't 
get stuck to my back. My ass crack was not as fortunate. When I scratched 
what I thought was an itch, I was actually grinding the jellyfish into my 
ass. 
<P>
I informed the dive supervisor of my dilemma over the communicator. His 
instructions were unclear due to the fact that he along with 5 other divers 
were laughing hysterically. Needless to say I aborted the dive.  I was 
instructed to make 3 agonizing in-water decompression stops totaling 35 
minutes before I could come to the surface for my chamber dry decompression. 
I got to the surface wearing nothing but my brass helmet.  My suit and gear 
were tied to the bell. When I got on board the medic, with tears of laughter 
running down his face, handed me a tube of cream and told me to shove it "up 
my ass" when I get in the chamber.  The cream put the fire out, but I 
couldn't shit for two days because my asshole was swollen shut. I later 
found out that this could easily have been prevented if the suction hose was 
placed on the leeward side of the ship. 
<P>
Anyway, the next time you have a bad day at the office, think of me.  Think 
about how much worse your day would be if you were to shove a jellyfish up 
your ass. I hope you have no bad days at the office. But if you do, I hope 
this will make more tolerable. Take care, and I hope to hear from you soon. 
<P>
Love, Brian
