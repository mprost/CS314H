</PRE>A man was in court on the charge od assault against his landlord. 
Entering a plea of guilty, his lawyer pled for clemency.  The lawyer 
pointed out that this was the defendent's first offense, and that he 
had been a productive ctizen, a veteren of WW II... 
<P>
At this point the judge, also a veteren of WW II, took interest.  He 
asked the defendent questions and determined he had been at the battle 
of the bulge (as had the judge) and killed a number of the enemy. 
<P>
The judge then asked the defendent what unit he was with.  After a 
pause, the defendent hesitently answers "9th Panzer, Your Honor."
