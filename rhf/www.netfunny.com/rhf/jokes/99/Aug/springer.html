</PRE>THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW 
<P>
Crowd: Jer-ry! Jer-ry! Jer-ry! 
<P>
Jerry: Today's guests are here because they can't agree   on fundamental 
philosophical principles. I'd like to welcome Todd to the show. 
<P>
Todd enters from backstage. 
<P>
Jerry: Hello, Todd. 
<P>
Todd: Hi, Jerry. 
Jerry: (reading from card) So, Todd, you're here to tell your girlfriend 
something. What is it? 
<P>
Todd: Well, Jerry, my girlfriend Ursula and I have been going out for three 
years now.  We did everything together.  We were really inseparable.  But 
then she discovered post-Marxist political and literary theory, and it's 
been nothing but fighting ever since. 
<P>
Jerry: Why is that? 
<P>
Todd: You see, Jerry, I'm a traditional Cartesian rationalist.  I believe 
that the individual self, the "I" or ego is the foundation of all 
metaphysics.  She, on the other hand, believes that the contemporary self is 
a socially constructed, multi-faceted  subjectivity reflecting the political 
and economic realities of late capitalist consumerist discourse. 
<P>
Crowd: Ooooohhhh! 
<P>
Todd: I know! I know! Is that infantile, or what? 
<P>
Jerry: So what do you want to tell her today? 
<P>
Todd: I want to tell her that unless she ditches the post-modernism, we're 
through.  I just can't go on having a relationship with a woman who doesn't 
believe I exist. 
<P>
Jerry: Well, you're going to get your chance.  Here's Ursula! 
<P>
Ursula storms onstage and charges up to Todd. 
<P>
Ursula: Patriarchal colonizer! 
<P>
She slaps him viciously.  Todd leaps up, but the security guys pull them 
apart before things can go any further. 
<P>
Ursula: Don't listen to him!  Logic is a male hysteria!  Rationality equals 
oppression and the silencing of marginalized voices! 
<P>
Todd: The classical methodology of rational dialectic is our only road to 
truth!  Don't try to deny it! 
<P>
Ursula: You and your dialectic!  That's how it's been through  our whole 
relationship, Jerry.  Mindless repetition of the post-Enlightenment 
meta-narrative.  "You have to start with radical doubt, Ursula." 
"Post-structuralism is just classical sceptical thought re-cast in the 
language of semiotics, Ursula." 
<P>
Crowd: Booo! Booo! 
<P>
Jerry: Well, Ursula, come on.  Don't you agree that the roots of 
contemporary neo-Leftism simply have to be sought in Enlightenment political 
philosophy? 
<P>
Ursula: History is the discourse of powerful centrally located voices 
marginalizing and de-scribing the sub-altern! 
<P>
Todd: See what I have to put up with?  Do you know what it's like living 
with someone who sees sex as a metaphoric demonstration of the anti-feminist 
violence implicit in the discourse of the dominant power structure?  It's 
terrible.  She just lies there and thinks of Andrea Dworkin.  That's why we 
never do it any more. 
<P>
Crowd: Wooooo! 
<P>
Ursula: You liar!  Why don't you tell them how you haven't  been able to 
get it up for the past three months because you couldn't  decide if your 
penis truly had essential Being, or was simply a  manifestation of Mind? 
<P>
Todd: Wait a minute!  Wait a minute! 
<P>
Ursula: It's true! 
<P>
Jerry: Well, I don't think we're going to solve this one right away. Our 
next guests are Louis and Tina. And Tina has a little  confession to make! 
<P>
Louis and Tina come onstage. Todd and Ursula continue bickering in the 
background. 
<P>
Jerry: Tina, you are... (reads cards) ... an  existentialist, is that 
right? 
<P>
Tina: That's right, Jerry. And Louis is, too. 
<P>
Jerry: And what did you want to tell Louis today? 
<P>
Tina: Jerry, today I want to tell him... 
<P>
Jerry: Talk to Louis.  Talk to him. 
<P>
Crowd hushes. 
<P>
Tina: Louis... I've loved you for a long time... 
<P>
Louis: I love you, too, Tina. 
<P>
Tina: Louis, you know I agree with you that existence  precedes essence, 
but...well, I just want to tell you I've been reading  Nietzsche lately, and 
I don't think I can agree with your egalitarian politics 
<P>
Crowd: Wooooo! Woooooo! 
<P>
Louis: (shocked and disbelieving) Tina, this is crazy. You know that Sartre 
clarified all this way back in the 40's. 
<P>
Tina: But he didn't take into account Nietzsche's radical critique of 
democratic morality, Louis.  I'm sorry.  I can't ignore the contradiction 
any longer! 
<P>
Louis: You got these ideas from Victor, didn't you?  Didn't you? 
<P>
Tina: Don't you bring up Victor!  I only turned to him when I saw you were 
seeing that dominatrix!  I needed a real man!  An Uber-man! 
<P>
Louis: (sobbing) I couldn't help it. It was my burden of freedom. It was 
too much! 
<P>
Jerry: We've got someone here who might have something to add.  Bring 
out...Victor! 
<P>
Victor enters. He walks up to Louis and sticks a finger in his face. 
<P>
Victor: Louis, you're a classic post-Christian intellectual.  Weak to the 
core! 
<P>
Louis: (through tears) You can kiss my Marxist ass, Reactionary Boy! 
<P>
Victor: Herd animal! 
<P>
Louis: Lackey! 
<P>
Louis throws a chair at Victor; they lock horns and wrestle.   The crowd 
goes wild.  After a long struggle, the security guys pry them apart. 
<P>
Jerry: Okay, okay. It's time for questions from the audience.  Go ahead, 
sir. 
<P>
Audience member: Okay, this is for Tina.  Tina, I just wanna know how you 
can call yourself an existentialist, and still agree with Nietzsche's 
doctrine of the Ubermensch.  Doesn't that imply a  belief in intrinsic 
essences that is in direct contradiction with with the fundamental 
principles of existentialism? 
<P>
Tina: No! No! It doesn't.  We can be equal in potential, without being 
equal in eventual personal quality.  It's a question of Becoming, not Being. 
<P>
Audience member: That's just disguised essentialism!  You're no 
existentialist! 
<P>
Tina: I am so! 
<P>
Audience member: You're no existentialist! 
<P>
Tina: I am so an existentialist, bitch! 
<P>
Ursula stands and interjects. 
<P>
Ursula: What does it [bleep] matter?  Existentialism is just a cover for 
late capitalist anti-feminism! Look at how Sartre treated  Simone de 
Beauvoir! 
<P>
Women in the crowd cheer and stomp. 
<P>
Tina: [Bleep] you! Fat-ass Foucaultian ho! 
<P>
Ursula: You only wish you were smart enough to understand Foucault, bitch! 
<P>
Tina: You the bitch! 
<P>
Ursula: No, you the bitch! 
<P>
Tina: Whatever! Whatever! 
<P>
Jerry: We'll be right back with a final thought! Stay with us! 
<P>
Commercial break for debt-consolidation loans, ITT Technical  Institute, 
and Psychic Alliance Hotline. 
<P>
Jerry: Hi! Welcome back. I just want to thank all our guests for being 
here,and say that I hope you're able to work through your differences and 
find happiness, if indeed happiness can be extracted from the dismal miasma 
of warring primal hormonal impulses we call human relationship. 
<P>
(turns to the camera) 
<P>
Well, we all think philosophy is just fun and games. Semiotics, 
deconstruction, Lacanian post-Freudian psychoanalysis, it all seems like 
good, clean fun. But when the heart gets involved, all our painfully 
acquired 
metaphysical insights go right out the window, and we're reduced to battling 
it out like rutting chimpanzees. It's not pretty. If you're in a 
relationship, and differences over the fundamental principles of your 
respective subjectivities are making things difficult, maybe it's time to 
move on. Find someone  new, someone who will accept you and the way your 
laughably limited human intelligence chooses to codify and rationalize the 
chaos of existence. After all, in the absence of a clear, unquestionable 
revelation from God, that's all we're all doing anyway. So remember: take 
care of yourselves--and each other. 
<P>
Announcer: Be sure to tune in next time, when KKK strippers battle it out 
with transvestite omnisexual porn stars! Tomorrow on Springer.
