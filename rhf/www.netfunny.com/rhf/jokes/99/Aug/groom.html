</PRE>Fed up with the way the bride invariably steals the show at her own 
wedding, the University at which Rob Tombes works carried in its news 
weekly its own unbiased account of his recent marriage here to Mary Beth 
Snyder: 
<P>
Mr Robert Tombes, son of Dr. and Mrs. Averett S. Tombes of Fairfax, Va., 
became the bridegroom of Miss Mary Elizabeth Snyder today at Fairfax 
Presbyterian Church. 
<P>
Mr. Tombes was attended by his brother Thomas Hamilton Tombes as best 
man.  As the groom approached the altar he was the cynosure of all eyes. 
Blushing handsomely, he replied to the questions of the clergyman in low 
but firm tones.  He was charmingly clad in a 3-piece suit consisting of 
coat, vest and pants.  The coat, of some dark material, was draped 
handsomely about the shoulders and tastefully gathered under the arms.  A 
touching story was current among the guests that the coat was the one worn 
by his father and grandfather on their wedding days.  Mr. Tombes would 
neither affirm nor deny the truth of this sentimental touch.  The vest was 
sleeveless and met in the front.  It was gracefully fashioned with pockets 
and at the back was held together by a strap and buckle of the same 
material. 
<P>
The groom's pants were of some dark material, and were suspended from 
the waist, falling in a straight line almost to the floor.  The severe 
simplicity of the garment was relieved by the right pantelet which was 
caught up about four inches from the floor by a Boston Brighton worn 
underneath, revealing just the artistic glimpse of leather, laced with 
string of the same color.  The effect was rather chic. 
<P>
Beneath the vest the groom wore blue galluses attached to the pants fore 
and aft and passing in a graceful curve over each shoulder.  His neck was 
encircled with a collar characterized by a delicate sawedge, and around the 
collar a cravat was loosely knotted so that it rode up under his left ear 
with a studied effect of carelessness which marks supreme artistry in 
dress. 
<P>
The best man's costume was essentially the same as the groom's, and as 
the two stood at the altar, a hush of awed admiration enveloped the 
audience. 
<P>
As Miss Snyder led the groom from the nuptials, it was noted that she 
wore the conventional white veil and orange blossoms.
