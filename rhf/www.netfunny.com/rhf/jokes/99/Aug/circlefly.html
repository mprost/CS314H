</PRE>It's the middle of summer and a Highway Patrolman pulls over a motorist 
for speeding.  While he's writing the ticket, flies keep buzzing around 
his head, annoying him considerably. 
<P>
"Circle flies sure are bad this year, aren't they?" says the motorist. 
<P>
"Yeah," says the patrolman, "if that's what these are, you're sure 
right.  But I've never heard of a circle fly before.  What's that?" 
<P>
"Well," the motorist responds, "circle flies are a species of fly that 
are particularly partial to horses.  Specifically, they tend to circle 
around a horse's rear end.  That's why they call 'em circle flies." 
<P>
The patrolman, catching the implication, replies, "You don't say.  Well, 
that's very interesting.  But it strikes me that you might be trying to 
call me a horse's ass.  You wouldn't be making that kind of implication 
about an officer of the law, would you?" 
<P>
"Oh, no sir!" responds the motorist.  "No, sir, not at all.  I have the 
utmost respect for law enforcement officers, and would never dream of 
implying that one of them was a horse's ass.  No, sir, I'm terribly 
sorry if that's how it sounded." 
<P>
"Yeah, I didn't think so," replied the patrolman. 
<P>
"Yeah," the motorist continued, "but there's just no fooling those 
circle flies, is there?" 
<P>

he got it.]
