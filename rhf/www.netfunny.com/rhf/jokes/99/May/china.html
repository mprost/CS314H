</PRE>What follows are some quickies sent in regarding the U.S. bombing of the 
Chinese embassy in Belgrade.  These are jokes which are funny, but which 
didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post such a digest whenever I 
have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly selective readers will 
probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to killfile RHF jokes with 
"Digest" in the title. 
<P>
I want to apologize in advance to any Chinese readers who may be offended 
by this material.  I further want to point out that this digest should not 
be taken to mean that Americans are treating the matter lightly.  We joke 
about our own disasters too, being the sick bastards that we are - ed. 
<P>

&gt;Subject: Only steal what works<BR>
<P>
</PRE>After the recent NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, the 
Chinese government has publicly announced the abandonment of its efforts to 
steal US mapping technology.  The US Defense Mapping Agency released a 
statement saying that they weren't worried anyway, because it would take a 
long time for Chinese agents to get back across the Antarctic circle to 
China with the stolen documents.

</PRE>Of COURSE the Chinese Government is angry.  How would you 
feel if YOU had invested millions of dollars in a perfectly 
good corrupt politician only to have him bomb YOUR embassy?

<P>
</PRE>Here, we have vast masses of angry Chinese demonstrators almost rioting 
outside the U.S. embassy, and an ambassador who won't give an ounce of 
credit to U.S. apologies or investigative efforts... 
<P>
Granted, it's not much fun to have your embassy bombed, but why can't 
the Chinese just act like civilized people and fire a few missiles at 
one of our pharmaceutical plants? 
<P>
