</PRE>Dear Bob: 
<P>
Q: My fiancee still has feelings for his old girlfriends. I'm afraid 
he will not be faithful. 
<P>
A: A man's capacity to love is boundless. It has been proven to 
increase with the number of sexual partners. Thus, by having a few 
other women, your partner is really increasing his love for you. Best 
thing to do is to buy him a nice, expensive present, and cook him a 
nice meal and don't mention this aspect of his behavior. 
<P>
Q: My husband has too many nights out with the boys. 
<P>
A: This is perfectly natural behavior - and it should be encouraged. 
The man is a hunter and he needs to prove his prowess with other men. 
Far from being pleasurable, a night out with the boys is a stressful 
affair, and to get back to you is a relief for your partner. Just look 
back at how emotional and  happy the man is when he returns to his 
stable home. Best thing to do is to buy him a nice, expensive present, 
and cook him a nice meal and don't mention this aspect of his 
behavior. 
<P>
Q: My husband wants to experience three-in-a-bed-sex with me and my 
sister. 
<P>
A: Your husband is clearly devoted to you. He cannot get enough of 
you, so he goes for the next best thing - your sister. Far from being 
an issue, this will bring all of the family together. Why not get some 
cousins involved? If you are still apprehensive, then let him go with 
your relatives, buy him a nice, expensive present, and cook him a nice 
meal and don't  mention this aspect of his behavior. 
<P>
Q: My husband continually asks me to perform oral sex with him. 
<P>
A: Do it. Sperm is not only great tasting, but has only 10 calories a 
spoonful. It is nutritious and helps you to keep your figure and gives 
a great glow to the skin.  Interestingly, a man knows this. His offer 
to you to perform oral sex with him is totally selfless. Oral sex is 
extremely painful for a man. This shows he loves you. Best thing to do 
is to thank him, buy him a nice, expensive present, and cook him a 
nice meal. 
<P>
Q: My husband doesn't know where my clitoris is. 
<P>
A: Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband. If you must mess 
with it, do it in your own time. To help with the family budget you 
may wish to video tape yourself while doing this, and to sell it at 
flea markets. To ease your selfish guilt, buy your man a nice 
expensive present, and cook him a delicious meal. 
<P>
Q: My husband goes straight to sleep after making love - we have no 
time to talk. 
<P>
A: Sex is an extremely difficult task for a man. Afterwards he needs 
rest. In fact, the more he loves you, the more hard work his 
love-making is, and the more rest he needs. Stop putting pressure on 
him. Buy him a nice, expensive present, and cook him a nice meal. 
<P>
Q: My husband's efforts at lovemaking only last 30 seconds. 
<P>
A: Your husband loves you very much. He is so turned on  by you that 
he cannot control himself. In fact, the shorter the 'effort' the more 
he loves you. Return this love by buying a nice, expensive present, 
and cooking him a nice meal. 
<P>
Q: My husband is uninterested in foreplay. 
<P>
A: Foreplay to a man is very hurtful. What it means is that you do not 
love your man as much as you should - he has to work a lot to get you 
in the mood. Abandon all wishes in this area, and make it up to him by 
buying a nice expensive present, and cooking a nice meal. 
<P>
Q: My husband has never given me an orgasm. 
<P>
A: The female orgasm is a  myth. It is fostered by militant, 
man-hating feminists and is a danger to the family unit.  Don't 
mention it again to him and show your love to him by buying a nice 
expensive present ..and don't forget to cook him a delicious meal. 
<P>
