</PRE>Raleigh, NC--When Joe Celery upgraded his home computer system, he ended 
up with a machine that was hotter than he bargained for. 
<P>
Joe Celery was a member of an elite group of computer enthusiasts that call 
themselves the "3l1t3 0v3rCl0cK3rz Gu1Ld." The group's focus is a technique 
called "overclocking," which is a technical term for running a system faster 
than it is rated. Some overclockers do it to save money, but many, like Joe 
Celery, overclock for fame. 
<P>
"I started out with a [Intel Corp. Celeron(tm)] 450A [300A processor 
overclocked to 450MHz," Mr. Celery stated in an exclusive interview from his 
hospital ward. "Sure, it ran Quake II real fast, but that wasn't enough. So 
then I tried watercooling." 
<P>
Using approximately $500 worth of supplies, including copper tubing and a 
small air conditioner, he managed to get his computer to run as fast as one 
with a Pentium II chip that cost almost $300 more than his Celeron(tm) 
processor. It would process millions of instructions per second for as long 
as an hour before crashing. 
<P>
He continued, "it was an incredible success. But I just wasn't satisfied. I 
wanted more." His next exploit involved a stack of Peltier cooling elements, 
flat devices that electrically transfer heat from one surface to another. 
The Peltier elements allowed him to crank his watercooling setup another 
10%, to match the performance of a Pentium II chip costing $500 more than a 
stock Celeron. It used only $300 worth of Peltier elements, as well as the 
original watercooling apparatus. 
<P>
Celery was markedly silent on how, exactly, he ended up in the hospital. 
After half an hour of prodding, he finally admitted what his latest creation 
was: "I tried to cool my system with hydrogen gas. It worked, until my hard 
drive spun up." 
<P>
The resultant explosion caused approximately $15,000 worth of damage to 
Celery's neighbors' homes, notwithstanding the destruction of his own home. 
Analysts estimate the amount of damage was greater than the damage possible 
if a Pentium III Xeon chip costing $1000 more than Joe Celery's Celeron(tm) 
chip was used. 
<P>
Celery left us with this final comment: "my next computer is going to be a 
Macintosh."
