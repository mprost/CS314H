</PRE>Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Heaven, God went missing for six days. 
Eventually, Michael the archangel found him, resting on the seventh day. 
He inquired of God, "Where have you been?" 
<P>
God sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction and proudly pointed downwards 
through the clouds, "Look Michael, look what I've made." 
<P>
Archangel Michael looked puzzled and said, "What is it?" 
<P>
"It's a planet," replied God, "and I've put LIFE on it. I'm going to call 
it Earth and it's going to be a great place of balance." 
<P>
"Balance?" inquired Michael, still confused. 
<P>
God explained, pointing to different parts of Earth, "For example, 
Northern Europe will be a place of great opportunity and wealth while 
Southern Europe is going to be poor; the Middle East over there will be a 
hot spot. Over there I've placed a continent of white people and over there 
is a continent of black people," God continued, pointing to different 
countries.  This one will be extremely hot and arid while this one will be 
very cold and covered in ice." 
<P>
The Archangel, impressed by Gods work, then pointed to a large land mass 
in the top corner and asked, "What's that one?" 
<P>
"Ah," said God.  "That's Canada, the most glorious place on Earth. 
There's beautiful mountains, lakes, rivers, streams and an exquisite 
coast-line. The people from Canada are going to be modest, intelligent and 
humorous and they're going to be found traveling the world.  They'll be 
extremely sociable, hard-working and high-achieving, and they will be known 
throughout the world as diplomats and carriers of peace.  I'm also going to 
give them super-human, undefeatable ice hockey players who will be admired 
and feared by all who come across them." 
<P>
Michael gasped in wonder and admiration but then proclaimed. "What about 
balance, God. You said there will be BALANCE!" 
<P>
God replied wisely. "Wait until you see the loud-mouth bastards I'm 
putting next to them." 
<P>
(CANADA:  132 years in the same location!  Open to serve you 24 hours per 
day, 7 days per week.  Now with 3 Territories!|)
