</PRE>There's going to be an extra scene included in the DVD release 
of EMPIRE STRIKES BACK coming up next year! 
<P>
Basically, it expands on the scene where Vader reveals his fatherhood to 
Luke, and ties up some loose ends created with the release of Episode 1... 
<P>
<BR>The Empire Strikes Back: Extra-Special Edition<BR>
<P>
<HR>
INT: BESPIN GANTRY - MOMENTS LATER:<BR>
<P>
</PRE>A furious lightsaber duel is underway. DARTH VADER is backing LUKE 
SKYWALKER towards the end of the gantry. 
<P>
A quick move by Vader, chops off Luke's hand! It goes spinning off into the 
ventilation shaft. 
<P>
Luke backs away. He looks around, but realizes there's nowhere to go but 
straight down. 
<P>
Darth Vader: Obi Wan never told you what happened to your father. 
<P>
Luke: He told me enough! He told me you killed him! 
<P>
Darth Vader: No... I am your father! 
<P>
Luke: No, it's not true! It's impossible. 
<P>
Darth Vader: Search your feelings... you know it to be true... 
<P>
Luke: NO! 
<P>
Darth Vader: Yes, it is true... and you know what else? You know that brass 
droid of yours? 
<P>
Luke: Threepio? 
<P>
Darth Vader: Yes... Threepio... I built him... when I was 7 years old... 
<P>
Luke: No... 
<P>
Darth Vader: Seven years old? And what have you done? Look at yourself, no 
hand, no job, and couldn't even levitate your own ship out of the swamp... 
<P>
Luke: I destroyed your precious Death Star! 
<P>
Darth Vader: When you were 20! When I was 10, I single-handedly destroyed a 
Trade Federation Droid Control ship! 
<P>
Luke: Well, it's not my fault... 
<P>
Darth Vader: Oh, here we go... "Poor me... my father never gave me what I 
wanted for my birthday... boo hoo, my daddy's the Dark Lord of the 
Sith...waahhh wahhh!" 
<P>
Luke: Shut up... 
<P>
Darth Vader: You're a slacker! By the time I was you're age, I had 
exterminated the Jedi knights! 
<P>
Luke: I used to race my T-16 through Beggar's Canyon 
<P>
Darth Vader: Oh, for the love of the Emperor... 10 years old, winner of the 
Boonta Eve Open... Only human to ever fly a Pod Racer... right here baby! 
<P>
Luke looks down the shaft. Takes a step towards it. 
<P>
Darth Vader: I was wrong... You're not my kid... I don't know whose you 
are, but you sure ain't mine... 
<P>
Luke takes a step off the platform, hesitates, then plunges down the shaft. 
<P>
Darth Vader looks after him. 
<P>
Darth Vader: Get a haircut! 
<P>
