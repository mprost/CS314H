</PRE>Our SysAdmin is kind enough to keep all of us users updated with notices of any 
particularly dangerous and/or rampant viruses.  Of course not all of us have the 
privilege of being able to take full advantage of the information.  His latest 
posting prompted me once again to attempt to become one of the privileged elite 
with a simple reply... 
<P>
[Up front, I send apologies to my Grade 12 English Teacher :-) ]

<BR>&gt;From: Merlin<BR>
&gt;To: SysAdmin<BR>
&gt;Subject: Re: PC VIRUS WARNING<BR>
<P>
Your friendly neighborhood System Administrator wrote:<BR>
[snip of irrelevant data to the point of my discussion]<BR>
&gt; If you have anti-virus software (e.g., Norton Anti-Virus, McAfee VirusScan,<BR>
&gt; etc.) installed on your PC, make sure you are updating the virus definitions<BR>
&gt; at LEAST once per month, preferably once per week.  Also be sure that<BR>
&gt; the "auto-protection" feature is enabled, which catches most viruses BEFORE<BR>
&gt; they infect your system.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<P>
To install or not install:  That is the question:<BR>
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<BR>
The slings and arrows of wild viruses,<BR>
Or to take up arms against sea of SysAdmins and Bean Counters,<BR>
And by installing end them? To infect: to be infected;<BR>
No more; and by an install to say we end<BR>
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<BR>
That Windows is heir to, 'tis a consummation<BR>
Devoutly to be wish'd. To install, to protect;<BR>
"If you have": perchance to upgrade: ay, there's the rub;<BR>
For with that feeling of safety what mortal conflicts may come<BR>
When IS with its licensing policies and<BR>
The Managers with their budget constraints discover his deed,<BR>
Must give us pause: there's the respect<BR>
That makes calamity of system maintenance;<BR>
For who would bear the whips and scorns of IS,<BR>
the bean counting oppressor's wrong, the SysAdmins contumely,<BR>
the pangs of despised system rebuilds,<BR>
When he himself might his safety make<BR>
With a "typical" install?<BR>
<P>
I could go on but wouldn't a site license be A WHOLE LOT EASIER for all<BR>
of us?!?!?<BR>
<P>
Signed,<BR>
A simple user under moral conflict.<BR>
