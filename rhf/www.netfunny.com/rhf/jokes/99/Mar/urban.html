</PRE>I know this guy whose neighbor, a young man, was home recovering from 
having been served a rat in his bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. So 
anyway, one day he went to sleep and when he awoke he was in his bathtub 
and it was full of ice and he was sore all over. When he got out of the 
tub he realized that HIS KIDNEYS HAD BEEN STOLEN and and he sw a note on 
his mirror that said  "Call 911!"  But he was afraid to use his  phone 
because it was connected to his computer, and there was a virus on his 
computer that would destroy his hard drive if he opened an e-mail 
entitled "Join the crew!" 
<P>
He knew it wasn't a hoax because he himself was a computer programmer 
who was working on software to save us from armageddon when the year 
2000 rolls around.  His program will prevent a global disaster in which 
all the computers get together and distribute the $600 Neiman Marcus 
cookie recipe under the leadership of Bill Gates.  (It's true-I read it 
all last week in a mass e-mail from BILL GATES HIMSELF, who was also 
promising me a free Disneyworld vacation and $5,000 if I would forward 
the e-mail to everyone I know.) 
<P>
The poor man then tried to call 911 from a pay phone to report his 
missing kidneys, but reaching into the coin-return slot he got jabbed 
with an HIV-infected needle around which was wrapped a note that said, 
"Welcome to the world of AIDS." 
<P>
Luckily he was only a few blocks from the hospital-the one, actually, 
where that little boy who is dying of cancer is, the one whose last wish 
is for everyone in the world to send him an e-mail and the American 
Cancer Society has agreed to pay him a nickel for every e-mail he 
receives.  I sent him two e-mails and one of them was a bunch of x's and 
o's in the shape of an angel (if you get it and forward it to twenty 
people you will have good luck but ten people you will only have ok luck 
and if you send it to less than ten people you will have BAD LUCK FOR 
SEVEN YEARS). 
<P>
So anyway the poor guy tried to drive himself to the hospital, but on 
the way he noticed another car driving along without his lights on.  To 
be helpful, he flashed his lights at him and was promptly shot as part 
of a gang initiation. 
<P>
And it's a little-known fact that the Y1K problem caused 
the Dark Ages.
