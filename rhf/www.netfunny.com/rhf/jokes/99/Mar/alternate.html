<P>
<BR>Women<BR>
<P>
Car Parking:<BR>
The smallest kerbside space successfully reversed into by a woman was one of<BR>
19.36m, equivalent to three standard parking spaces, by Mrs. E. Simpkins<BR>
(GB) driving an unmodified Vauxhall Nova Swing on 12th October 1993.  She<BR>
started the manoeuvre at 11:15am in Roper Street, Pontefract, and<BR>
successfully parked within three feet of the pavement, 8 hours 14 mins<BR>
later.  There was slight damage to the bumpers and wings of her own and the<BR>
two adjoining cars, as well as shop frontage and two lampposts.<BR>
<P>
Incorrect Driving:<BR>
The longest journey completed with the handbrake on was one of 313 miles<BR>
from Stranraer to Holyhead, by Dr. Julie Thorn (GB), at the wheel of a Saab<BR>
900 on 2nd April 1987. Dr. Thorn smelled burning two miles into her journey<BR>
at Aird, but pressed on to Holyhead with smoke billowing from the rear<BR>
wheels.  This journey also holds the records for the longest completed with<BR>
the choke fully out and the right indicator flashing.<BR>
<P>
Traffic Light Cosmetics:<BR>
The longest spell spent oblivious to traffic lights whilst applying make up<BR>
was one of 1hr 51min 38sec by Miss J. Dobson (GB) at a road junction in the<BR>
centre of Preston on the 1st August 1975. Miss Dobson, a piano teacher,<BR>
beautified herself through 212 cycles of the light, creating a tailback of<BR>
irate motorists stretching 28 miles towards the Lake District.<BR>
<P>
Group Toilet Visit:<BR>
The record for the largest group of women to visit a toilet simultaneously<BR>
is held by 147 workers at the dept. of  Social Security, Long Benton. At<BR>
their annual celebration at a nightclub in Newcastle upon Tyne on 12th Oct<BR>
1994, Mrs. Beryl Crabtree (GB) got up to go to the toilet and was<BR>
immediately followed by 146 other female members of the party.  Moving en<BR>
masse, the group entered the toilet at 9:52pm and after waiting for everyone<BR>
to finish, emerged 2hrs 37mins later.<BR>
<P>
Men<BR>
<P>
Expletives:<BR>
On 9th June 1996, Mr. Harold Brayson (GB) struck his thumb with a<BR>
stonemason's mallet whilst breaking concrete in his back yard in Tewkesbury,<BR>
Gloucestershire. He went on to swear for 14min 7sec without stopping once or<BR>
repeating a swear word. He later attempted to better this feat on BBC TV's<BR>
Record Breakers programme by dropping a car battery on his foot. It ended in<BR>
failure when he repeated the word 'bastard' after 12mins 58secs.<BR>
<P>
Holiday Gymnastics:<BR>
The greatest number of press-ups done in front of some girls on a beach is 6<BR>
by Wayne Fletcher (GB) whilst on holiday in San Antonio, Ibiza on 19th<BR>
August 1988. The girls went off with a waiter.<BR>
<P>
Car Customisation:<BR>
Judged as a proportion of the overall value of the car, the accessories<BR>
fitted to the Mark 2 Escort of Wayne Fletcher (GB) add up to the world's<BR>
most expensive car customisation project at 105761%. Between 8th March 1986<BR>
and 22nd September 1996, Fletcher has spent a grand total of 63,456.99 at<BR>
the Stockport branch of Halfords in attempt to attract girls to his vehicle.<BR>
His fruitless purchases include a Paddy Hopkirk Full Body Styling Kit<BR>
(3500),  'Nightrider' style Disco Stop Lights (199), Split 45 Weber<BR>
Carburettors x4 (200),  Scorpion Talking Alarm, (500) and a Chromium<BR>
plated Mock Twin Exhaust Extension (285).  The car is currently valued at<BR>
50 to 60.<BR>
<P>
Beer Drinking:<BR>
The greatest amount of beer drunk before going to the lavatory was 25.5<BR>
litres (45 pints) of assorted weak lagers, by Mr. George Wingfield (GB)<BR>
downed in various pubs in Knutsford, Cheshire between 12:15pm and 2:38pm on<BR>
22nd December 1986.<BR>
<P>
Urinating:<BR>
The longest urination delivered at one continuous scoot was one of 36 mins<BR>
24secs by Mr George Wingfield (GB) in the doorway of a newsagent's shop in<BR>
Knutsford High Street on 22nd December 1986.  Mr Wingfield was arrested and<BR>
charged with a public order offence 17 mins into his record attempt, but<BR>
arresting officers had to wait a further 19mins 24sec before taking him back<BR>
to the station, where he reputedly broke the world falling downstairs'<BR>
record.  However, this could not be substantiated because there were<BR>
apparently no witnesses.<BR>
<P>
Hottest Curry Eaten:<BR>
Many claims are made about the ferocity of curries eaten, but in the main<BR>
they are difficult to substantiate. The hottest verifiable curry eaten was a<BR>
XXX Hot Chicken Murg Phaal with extra chillies consumed by George Wingfield<BR>
(GB) at the Bengal Tiger Restaurant, Knutsford on 23rd December 1986.  The<BR>
curry was reportedly so hot that between kitchen and table it spontaneously<BR>
burst into flames, singeing the waiter's eyebrows.<BR>
<P>
Biggest Gaseous Excretion:<BR>
The largest and most catastrophic 'botty burp' was one dropped by Mr.  George<BR>
Wingfield (GB) in the car park of the Dog and Duck, Knutsford, on the<BR>
morning of the 24th December 1986.  Suffering from bad guts, Mr. Wingfield<BR>
gingerly attempted to squeeze one out whilst bending to pick up his car<BR>
keys, but the resulting flatulent explosion blew his entire digestive tract<BR>
out of his anus. Attending firemen hosed down his smoking guts for two hours<BR>
before paramedics with breathing apparatus could begin the process of<BR>
pushing them back up.<BR>
