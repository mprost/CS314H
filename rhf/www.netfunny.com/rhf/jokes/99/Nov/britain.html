</PRE>I work in Boston, Massachusetts.  A co-worker just told me this true 
story that happened to him this morning.  He had a dispute about a 
phone-card bill for long distance service from his long-distance carrier, 
which we shall refer to by the three-letter acronym TLA to protect 
the guilty.  Towards the end of his very long and unproductive call 
he was starting to get exasperated, and the following (paraphrased) 
exchange ensued. 
<P>
("CW" = my co-worker; "TLA" = TLA's front-line customer support; "SUP" 
= TLA support supervisor.) 
<P>
CW:  Look, it's 9:20, I'm late for work, and I need to get this resolved. 
<P>
TLA: It's not 9:20; it's only 7:30. 
<P>
CW:  Where are you located? 
<P>
TLA: I'm in Colorado. 
<P>
CW:  Well, I'm in New England, and here it's 9:20. 
<P>
TLA: Oh, <B>that's</B> your problem!  Your phone card doesn't work overseas. 
<P>
CW:  I'm in <B>New</B> England, I'm not overseas! 
<P>
TLA: Yes you are; your phone card doesn't work in England. 
<P>
CW:  Listen, can I talk to your supervisor? 
<P>
[Pause, pause.  The supervisor comes on the line.] 
<P>
SUP: Hey, are you calling from Great Britain? 
<P>
*Sigh*.  And not only did he not get his billing problem straightened 
out, but they charged him for what was supposed to be a toll-free call 
to their support line. 
<P>
