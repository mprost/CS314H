</PRE>Dear Cassius: 
<P>
Are you still working on the Y zero K problem?  This change from BC to AD is 
giving us a lot of headaches and we haven't much time left.  I don't know 
how people will cope with working the wrong way around.  Having been working 
happily downwards forever, now we have to start thinking upwards. You would 
think that someone would have thought of it earlier and not left it to us to 
sort it all out at this last minute. 
<P>
I spoke to Caesar the other evening.  He was livid that Julius hadn't done 
something about it when he was sorting out the calendar.  He said he could 
see why Brutus turned nasty.  We called in Consultus, but he simply said 
that continuing downwards using minus BC won't work and as usual charged a 
fortune for doing nothing useful.  Surely we will not have to throw out all 
our hardware and start again?  Macrohard will make yet another fortune out 
of this I suppose. 
<P>
The money lenders are paranoid of course!  They have been told that all 
usury rates will invert and they will have to pay their clients to take out 
loans.  Its an ill wind ...... 
<P>
As for myself, I just can't see the sand in an hourglass flowing upwards. We 
have heard that there are three wise men in the East who have been working 
on the problem, but unfortunately they won't arrive until it's all over. 
<P>
I have heard that there are plans to stable all horses at midnight at the 
turn of the year as there are fears that they will stop and try to run 
backwards, causing immense damage to chariots and possible loss of life. 
<P>
Some say the world will cease to exist at the moment of transition.  Anyway, 
we are still continuing to work on this blasted Y zero K problem. I will 
send a parchment to you if anything further develops. 
<P>
If you have any ideas please let me know, 
<P>
