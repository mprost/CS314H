</PRE>What follows are the latest entries in the true news file.  These are "this 
really happened" or "I saw this" jokes which are funny, but which didn't 
really warrant posting separately.  I post such a digest whenever I have 
enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly selective readers will probably 
not enjoy the digests, and may want to killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in 
the title - ed.
