</PRE>Below find the better Kennedy jokes I've received so far.  These are jokes 
which are funny, but which didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post 
such a digest whenever I have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly 
selective readers will probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to 
killfile RHF jokes with "Digest" in the title. 
<P>
If you are at all disturbed by sick humor, don't read any farther.

<H1 align=center>What we learned from the experiment</H1>
<P>
&gt; Q: Why did Maria Shriver marry Arnie?<BR>
&gt; A: They were trying to breed bullet-proof Kennedys.<BR>
<P>
Maybe she should have married Dean Cain.  Then we'd have bullet-proof<BR>
Kennedys that can fly...<BR>

The universe has a twisted sense of humor.  The only Kennedy that's able to<BR>
survive, despite all his own efforts to the contrary, is Ted.<BR>

If you don't think that the JFK Jr. story is important,<BR>
answer me this:<BR>

When was the last time the news led off with the deaths<BR>
of a publicist, an investment banker, and a lawyer, and<BR>
you actually felt sad about it?<BR>

<H1 align=center>JFK, Jr. crash.......</H1>
<P>
There has already been a lot of speculation as to what may have caused<BR>
JFK, Jr.'s plane to crash. Some have even suggested that he may have run<BR>
into a bird. Others have questioned how many and what type of bird would<BR>
be enough to bring down an airplane under these circumstances.<BR>
<P>
I myself subscribe to the single pullet theory...<BR>
