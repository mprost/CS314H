</PRE>A True Story, if she had killed herself she'd be a shoe-in for the Darwin 
Award. 
<P>
Last summer, down on Lake Isabella, located in the high desert, an hour east 
of Bakersfield, a blonde, new to boating was having a problem. No matter how 
hard she tried, she just couldn't get her brand new 22-ft Bayliner to 
perform. It wouldn't get on a plane at all, and it was very sluggish in 
almost every maneuver, no matter how much power she applied. 
<P>
After about an hour of trying to make it go, she putted over to a nearby 
marina. Maybe they could tell her what was wrong.  A thorough topside check 
revealed everything was in perfect working order. The engine ran fine, the 
outdrive went up and down, the prop was the correct size and pitch.  So, one 
of the marina guys jumped in the water to check underneath.  He came up 
choking on water, he was laughing so hard.  Under the boat, still strapped 
securely in place, was the trailer. 
<P>
