</PRE>In a surprise announcement today, Microsoft President Steve Ballmer 
revealed that the Redmond-based company will allow computer resellers 
and end-users to customize the appearance of the Blue Screen of Death 
(BSOD), the screen that displays when the Windows operating system 
crashes. 
<P>
The move comes as the result of numerous focus groups and customer 
surveys done by Microsoft. Thousands of Microsoft customers were asked, 
"What do you spend the most time doing on your computer?" 
<P>
A surprising number of respondents said, "Staring at a Blue Screen of 
Death." At 54 percent, it was the top answer, beating the second place 
answer "Downloading XXXScans" by an easy 12 points. 
<P>
"We immediately recognized this as a great opportunity for ourselves, 
our channel partners, and especially our customers," explained the 
excited Ballmer to a room full of reporters. 
<P>
Immense video displays were used to show images of the new 
customizable BSOD screen side-by-side with the older static version. 
Users can select from a collection of "BSOD Themes," allowing them to 
instead have a Mauve Screen of Death or even a Paisley Screen of Death. 
Graphics and multimedia content can now be incorporated into the 
screen, making the BSOD the perfect conduit for delivering product 
information and entertainment to Windows users. 
<P>
The BSOD is by far the most recognized feature of the Windows 
operating system, and as a result, Microsoft has historically insisted 
on total control over its look and feel. This recent departure from 
that policy reflects Microsoft's recognition of the Windows desktop 
itself as the "ultimate information portal." By default, the new BSOD 
will be configured to show a random selection of Microsoft product 
information whenever the system crashes.  Microsoft channel partners 
can negotiate with Microsoft for the right to customize the BSOD on 
systems they ship. 
<P>
Major computer resellers such as Compaq, Gateway, and Dell are 
already lining up for premier placement on the new and improved BSOD. 
<P>
Ballmer concluded by getting a dig in against the Open Source 
community.  "This just goes to show that Microsoft continues to 
innovate at a much faster pace than open source. I have yet to see any 
evidence that Linux even has a BSOD, let alone a customizable one."
