</PRE>A true story... 
<P>
My wife and I recently had our first house built.  Since we moved in I have 
been very busy with "do-it-yourself" projects such as adding water filters, 
building shelves, installing garage door openers, and even some pretty 
involved projects like building retaining walls and installing a lawn 
sprinkler system.  My wife has been complaining that I've become quite 
obsessed with doing everything myself without professional help, to which 
I've always countered that I can do these projects cheaper and with more 
care than the average professional. 
<P>
Last night I had a dream that my great aunt, who is currently in poor 
health, passed away.  In my dream I convinced my cousin that I could perform 
the embalming of her mother at home "cheaper and with greater care" than the 
mortuary. 
<P>
First thing this morning I called my landscaping company and said they could 
go ahead and lay my sod for me instead of just delivering it.
