</PRE>A CHORISTER'S GUIDE TO KEEPING CONDUCTORS IN LINE 
<P>
1. Never be satisfied with the starting pitch.  If the 
conductor uses a pitch-pipe, make known your preference 
for pitches from the piano, and vice-versa. 
<P>
2. Complain about the temperature of the rehearsal 
room, the lighting, crowded space, or a draft.  It is 
best to do this when the conductor is under pressure. 
<P>
3. Bury your head into the music just before the cues. 
<P>
4. Ask for a re-audition or seating change.  Ask often. 
Give the impression you are about to quit.  Let the 
conductor know your are there as a personal favor. 
<P>
5. Loudly clear your throat during pauses.  (Tenors are 
trained to do this from birth.)  Quiet instrumental 
interludes are a good chance to blow your nose. 
<P>
6. Wait until well into a rehearsal before letting the 
conductor know that you do not have the music. 
<P>
7. Look at your watch frequently.  Shake it in 
disbelief occasionally. 
<P>
8. Find an excuse to leave the rehearsal fifteen 
minutes early so that others will become restless and 
start to fidget. 
<P>
9. Tell the conductor, "I can't find the beat." 
Conductors are always sensitive about their "stick 
technique," so challenge it frequently. 
<P>
10. If your articulation differs from that of others, 
stick to your guns.  Do not ask the conductor which is 
correct until backstage just before the concert. 
<P>
(In other words, make every effort to take the 
attention away from the podium and put it on you, where 
it belongs.)
