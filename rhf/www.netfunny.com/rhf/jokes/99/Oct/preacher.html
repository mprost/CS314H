<PRE>.d

A newly appointed young preacher was contacted by the local funeral
director to hold a graveside service at a small country cemetery. There was
to be no funeral, just the committal, because the deceased had no family or
friends left. The young pastor started early to the cemetery, but soon lost
his way. After making several wrong turns, he finally arrived a half-hour
late. The hearse was no where in sight, and the workman were relaxing under
a nearby tree, eating their lunch. The pastor went to the open grave and
found that the vault lid was already in place. He took out his book and
read the service. As he returned to his car, he overheard one of the
workman say, "Maybe we'd better tell him that's a septic tank."
