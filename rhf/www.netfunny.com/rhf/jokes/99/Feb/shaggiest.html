</PRE>A man who lived in a block of apartments thought it was raining and put 
his head out the window to check.  As he did so a glass eye fell into his 
hand. 
<P>
He looked up to see where it came from in time to see a young woman 
looking down. 
<P>
"Is this yours?" he asked. 
<P>
She said, "Yes, could you bring it up?" and the man agreed. 
<P>
On arrival she was profuse in her thanks and offered the man a drink.  As 
she was very attractive he agreed.  Shortly afterwards she said, "I'm 
about to have dinner.  There's plenty; would you like to join me?" 
<P>
He readily accepted her offer and both enjoyed a lovely meal. As the 
evening was drawing to a close the lady said, "I've had a marvelous 
evening.  Would you like to stay the night?" 
<P>
The man hesitated then said, "Do you act like this with every man you 
meet?" 
<P>
"No," she replied, "only those who catch my eye." 
<P>
[This was sent to me via e-mail from somebody who <B>just</B> ceased being 
my friend.]
