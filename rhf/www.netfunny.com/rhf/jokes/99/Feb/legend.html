</PRE>I know this guy whose neighbor, a young man, was home recovering from 
having been served a rat in his bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. So 
anyway, one day he went to sleep and when he awoke he was in his bathtub 
and it was full of ice and he was sore all over.  When he got out of the 
tub he realized that HIS KIDNEYS HAD BEEN STOLEN and he saw a note on his 
mirror that said, "Call 911!"  But he was afraid to use his phone because 
it was connected to his computer, and there was a virus on his computer 
that would destroy his hard drive if he opened an e-mail entitled "Join 
the crew!" He knew it wasn't a hoax because he himself was a computer 
programmer who was working on software to save us from Armageddon when the 
year 2000 rolls around. And it's a little-known fact that the Y1K problem 
caused the Dark Ages. 
<P>
His program will prevent a global disaster in which all the computers 
get together and distribute the $600 Neiman-Marcus cookie recipe under the 
leadership of Bill Gates.  (It's true--I read it all last week in a mass 
e-mail from BILL GATES HIMSELF, who was also promising me a free Disney 
World vacation and $5,000 if I would forward the e-mail to everyone I 
know.)  The poor man then tried to call 911 from a pay phone to report his 
missing kidneys, but reaching into the coin-return slot he got jabbed with 
an HIV-infected needle around which was wrapped a note that said, "Welcome 
to the world of AIDS." 
<P>
Luckily he was only a few blocks from the hospital--the one where 
that little boy who is dying of cancer is, the one whose last wish is for 
everyone in the world to send him an e-mail and the American Cancer 
Society has agreed to pay him a nickel for every e-mail he receives.  I 
sent him two e-mails and one of them was a lunch of x's and o's in the 
shape of an angel (if you get it and forward it to 20 people you will have 
good luck but 10 people you will only have OK luck and if you send it to 
less than 10 people you will have BAD LUCK FOR SEVEN YEARS). 
<P>
So anyway the poor guy tried to drive himself to the hospital, but on 
the way he noticed another car driving along without its lights on.  To be 
helpful, he flashed his lights at him and was promptly shot as part of a 
gang initiation. 
<P>
STOP THE INSANITY! NO URBAN LEGEND EMAIL STRINGS IN 1999!
