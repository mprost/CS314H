</PRE>The General went out to find that none of his G.I.s were there. 
One finally ran up, panting heavily. 
<P>
"Sorry, sir!  I can explain, you see I had a date and it ran a 
little late. I ran to the bus but missed it, I hailed a cab but 
it broke down, found a farm, bought a horse but it dropped dead, 
ran 10 miles, and now I'm here." 
<P>
The General was very skeptical about this explanation but at 
least he was here so he let the G.I. go.  Moments later, eight 
more G.I.s came up to the general panting, he asked them why 
they were late. 
<P>
"Sorry, sir!  I had a date and it ran a little late, I ran to 
the bus but missed it, I hailed a cab but it broke down, found a 
farm, bought a horse but it dropped dead, ran 10 miles, and now 
I'm here." 
<P>
The General eyed them, feeling very skeptical but since he let 
the first guy go, he let them go, too.  A ninth G.I. jogged up 
to the General, panting heavily, 
<P>
"Sorry, sir!  I had a date and it ran a little late, I ran to 
the bus but missed it, I hailed a cab but..." 
<P>
"Let me guess," the General interrupted, "it broke down." 
<P>
"No," said the G.I., "there were so many dead horses in the 
road, it took forever to get around them."
