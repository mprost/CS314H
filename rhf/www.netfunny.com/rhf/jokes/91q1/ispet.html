<P>
(This allegedly really happened in Canada.  I heard it from a 
friend.  After posting it in rec.backcountry I got some requests to 
post it here.) 
<P>
Some guy on drugs jumped over a cliff but did not quite succeed in 
killing himself.  The rescue team tied his unconscious body into a 
Stokes litter and proceeded to evacuate by means of a "fixed line 
flyaway."  This means that the litter is suspended a couple of 
hundred feet below a helicopter which then flies to a level place 
where they can set him down (carefully) and either load him in the 
aircraft or otherwise take further care of him.  The patient is 
accompanied by one attendant tied into the litter. 
<P>
This patient began to regain consciousness during the flight. 
Remember he is flying across the sky and being marginally conscious 
(as well as probably still feeling the effects of whatever drug he 
took) probably doesn't notice either the helicopter or the cable 
attaching him to it.  The attendant, who happens to have a nice 
bushy beard, notices that the patient is starting to "come around" 
and in an effort to keep him calm says in his most soothing voice: 
<P>
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.  My name is Peter. 
<P>
The effect was somewhat less soothing than hoped for and the 
attendant decided that next time he would use a name other than 
Peter. 
<P>
