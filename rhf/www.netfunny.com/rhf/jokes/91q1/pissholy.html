<P>
There were three pious monks.  These monks were so pious, in fact, that 
the head abbot decided one day to reward their devotion by granting 
them each one day of sin, on the condition that they confess their 
activities to him at the end of the day. 
<P>
So, the day cometh, and the three monks go off into the night to indulge 
in all manner of sin. 
<P>
The first monk saunters in at 1:00 in the morning, and tries to sneak 
upstairs to bed.  But the head abbot, who was waiting up for the three, 
stopped him and demanded that he relate his doings. 
<P>
"No, head abbot," the first monk said, "it's too evil for me to admit!" 
<P>
"The deal was for you to tell me everything you did, otherwise you 
will not receive absolution!" said the abbot. 
<P>
So the first monk agreed to tell what he did.  "I - I - I drank!  And I did 
all manner of drugs!  And I smoked tea bags and old polyester ties, and I 
snorted coffee whitener...." 
<P>
"Enough!"  said the head abbot, enraged.  "Those are evil sins, but I 
promised to forgive you.  Go out back, drink some Holy Water, say some 
prayers and you will be forgiven in the morning." 
<P>
The first monk thankfully went off to follow the abbot's instructions. 
<P>
The second monk wanders in at 2:00 AM.  "What did you do last night?" demanded 
the head abbot. 
<P>
"I can't say!  It's much too evil!" 
<P>
"The agreement was that you must tell me everything you did!" 
<P>
"Okay," agreed the second monk.  "I had all manner of sex.  I had sex with 
young girls, young boys, small furry quadrupeds, large species of flora, 
my CD player..." 
<P>
"Enough!"  cried the head abbot.  "That is a truly great sin.  But I 
promised to give you absolution.  Go out back and drink some Holy Water. 
Then say some prayers and you will be forgiven in the morning." 
<P>
The second monk sauntered off to do just that. 
<P>
And the third and final monk crawls in at 3:00 in the morning. 
<P>
"What," asks the head abbot, "did you do this evening?" 
<P>
"No, head abbot, it's too great a sin to admit.  I cannot tell!" 
<P>
"The agreement, monk!  You must tell me!" 
<P>
The third monk bowed his head and nodded.  "All right, head abbot.  Last 
night I...I..." 
<P>
"Yes?" 
<P>
"I pissed in the Holy Water."
