The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. 
Your question was: 
<!-- Unknown %s typeface--><P>
<P>
Why is it that most men suffer a complete loss if personality when 
exposed in any manner to a computer? 
<P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
In order to explain this I must detail the story of creation... 
<P>
In the beginning there was a Computer.  And God said to the computer 
<P>
% vi creation.c 
<P>
He then wrote the universe, and compiled it and it was good. 
And God ran it in background, and saw that it was good.  He 
then noticed that the Universe was eating CPU time and tried 
to kill it, so that he could do his important work, which 
was to determine the Ultimate Question of Life the Universe 
and Everything.  The Operating System had a glitch and the 
Universe could not be kill -9'd. 
<P>
It came to pass that a lady friend of His wanted to visit 
with Him.  He snarled at her for the interuption.  Then Man, 
being made in His image, forever duplicated this when being 
interupted by women while he was working on a computer. 
<P>
That is why men react poorly when being interupted on the 
computer.  It is a Divine trait. 
<P>
You owe the Oracle the source code for the Universe.

The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. 
Your question was: 
<!-- Unknown %s typeface--><P>
<P>
What is the correct ritual for summoning God? 
<P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
The Oracle, in its infinite wisdom, senses that the mirrors of 
prophecy have darkened somewhat, and thus cannot choose the proper 
form of response to your question.  Please locate the adjective below 
that best describes you, and read your corresponding response. 
<P>
<HR>
ALT.FLAMER: 
<P>
Yell "Hey, God!"  Wait a second.  Yell "Hey, God, you *&amp;^$#@ piece of 
omnipotent #@%&amp;*, get your #@$ down here!"  Wait a second.  Mumble 
"&amp;@!$#!@$%&amp;#@" under your breath.  Give up. 
<P>
You owe the Oracle an overly aggressive rhubarb.

UNDER-18 GEEK: 
<P>
Summoning of God 
<P>
Can be done only by a magic-user or cleric of level 16 or higher.  A 
roll of 35 or above on 2d20 results in the appearance of God as a 
shining white brilliance about 10' in front of the caster.  Any 
character touching God must Save vs. Magic Wands or suddenly begin 
singing the Hallelujah Chorus.  God attacks as a 30 hit die monster 
and is immune to spells, wands, and funny faces.  God can only be hit 
by a paladin with +6 armor and a +5 weapon.  When hit, God will say, 
"Ouch!  You cur!" and instantly smote the attacking character into 
dust.  The dust may be swept into a pile by a +2 broom of sweeping.

ORACLE ADDICT: 
<P>
Hmm, let me call him.  Hey, God! 
<P>
<BR>&gt;Message from god!iuvax on ttyp4 at 21:22 ...<BR>
&gt;Yes, what is it?  What do you want?<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Somebody wants to talk to you, God. 
<P>
&gt;Yes?  Can't you just give them my Internet address? 
<P>
Sure would like to, God.  But you see, in the context of an Oracular 
message you've degenerated from a halfhearted joke into an 
irrepressively boring formulaic answer. 
<P>
&gt;What is this?  What are you saying? 
<P>
God, you're dead.  Not because of that #@$%*!@ Nietzche, not because 
you're old, not because you hang out at the terminal room on Saturday 
nights.  You're dead because you are invoked for answering questions 
like "How much would does a wood chuck chuck if a woodchuck could 
chuck wood?" and "Is Lisa good in bed?"  You're such a stiff. 
<P>
&gt;Watch yourself, Oracle!  Or I'll ... 
<P>
Yeah, yeah, right.  You were never very funny, and you're a bore now. 
Know why?  I'm making you up. 
<P>
&gt;What do you mean, "I'm making you up?" 
<P>
This conversation is totally fake, God.  I put that greater-than sign 
in front of your response.  You were fun when I first thought of you 
and now you're sorta dull.  A response starting with "Message from 
god!iuvax" implies a short snooze for me.  You're a dud! 
<P>
&gt;Oracle, give up this insipid game immediately or I'l 
<P>
You'll what? 
<P>
&gt;Or else I'll 
<P>
You don't understand!  I made *you*!  I can change your prompt!

Your answer: Do not write to God.  Instead direct all questions and 
comments regarding the state of the Universe to the all-knowing Me, 
the Oracle.  God is simply a mathematical construct of mine that I use 
to amuse myself during spare clock cycles.

The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. 
Your question was: 
<!-- Unknown %s typeface--><P>
<P>
Oracle Most Mighty, Powerful, Invincible, Omnipotent, Supreme, 
Important, Commanding, Forceful, Influential, Strong, and Robust ... 
<P>
What other uses can I put my thesaurus to? 
<P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
Are you kidding?  Why, the thesaurus is one of the most useful items 
you will ever own!  Besides the obvious physical uses (such as 
propping up computer tables with wobbly legs and the like), a 
thesaurus has virtually unlimited possibilities: 
<P>
* Dealing with parents - A continuous refrain of "Dad, I need more 
money 'cause I'm broke" wears thin on even the most loving of 
parental ears after a while.  With just a little flipping through 
the pages of your trusty thesaurus, your begging will sound like 
IBM's annual report.  "Dad, I am experiencing a balance shortfall 
due to unforeseen second-quarter operating expenses.  Further 
infusion of venture capital is required to continue funding of 
ongoing projects at their present level."  Assuming your father 
isn't a CFO for a Fortune 500 company, you'll get the money you 
need for that party at the Phi Sig house right away!  They'll 
believe that you must be learning SOMEthing at that college.... 
<P>
* Dealing with bureaucrats - Ever get frustrated when those pesky 
jerks at major service organizations (government agencies, banks, 
universities, department store customer-service departments, and 
the local video rental shop) spew forth streams of gibberish at 
your tender eardrums?  Well, with the aid of your trusty thesaurus, 
you can baffle 'em right back!  "There was an unplanned causal 
intervention approximately a fortnight ago, so I was sadly forced 
to defer the expediting of the necessary papers to your department." 
(Translation: "Two weeks ago my tire blew, so that's why I haven't 
given you your stupid forms yet.")  At the very least, you'll be 
able to curse these devotees of rules and regulations in new and 
exciting ways. 
<P>
* Dealing with the fairer sex - Now HERE'S a use of the thesaurus that 
we can all empathize with...don't just rely on "You look great 
today!" or something like that.  Instead, flip through your trusty 
thesaurus and say, "Darling, you look absolutely splendiferous this 
afternoon.  Your new lace-edged tie-dyed T-shirt and Lycra miniskirt 
look simply luscious!"  Women who hear this begin to entertain the 
notion that you are a man of intelligence and sensitivity, and one 
with a sense of language that never sleeps.  They will, in short, 
want to bear your children--or, at the very least, engage in hours 
of nonstop copulation.  And the thesaurus can help even in those 
areas; why settle for "You were great, Baby!" when you can say 
"Madame, your performance was extraordinarily skillful and 
masterfully executed; you are quite clearly an artiste 
extraordinaire!" 
<P>
Perhaps the Oracle has made his point.  There are many, many possible 
uses for a thesaurus; while it may be obfuscatory, and certainly 
rather cloying in its descriptivity, it is nevertheless quite clearly 
a very powerful and versatile tool.

The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. 
Your question was: 
<!-- Unknown %s typeface--><P>
<P>
Okay, now, this is completely hypothetical of course, but you know how 
on those audience-participation talk shows, like Donahue and Geraldo, 
they have these doctors and their patients that have these problems, 
like, just for example, they like to dress up as cowboys and dance the 
lambada with live catfish, and the people on the show take phone calls 
answer people's questions?  Well, just supposing that one day a person 
was to call one of those shows and talk about this problem they had and 
then realized that they'd dialed the wrong number and the guy on the 
other end had bought that service that tells them what the caller's 
phone number is, and they wanted to blackmail the person--what could the 
person do about it?  Just hypothetically. 
<P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
&gt; KICK TALK-SHOW HOST.

Yo who are you? 
<P>
</PRE>And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
I'm the Oracle, of course. It's obvious you haven't done this before, 
so I'll explain how this works. 
<P>
Send your question to oracle@iuvax.cs.indiana.edu. Be sure to begin 
your letter with lots of flowery praise. Do not use any of the 
following openings: 
<P>
TYPE OF BOO-BOO          EXAMPLE                PUNISHMENT 
<P>
<HR>
None          " "                             Spending eternity 
sucking lava through 
an iron straw 
<P>
Sarcastic     "Oh, Oracle, you whose          Spontaneous 
shit smells like roses..."      disembowelment 
<P>
Obscure       "Oracle, you whose ventricle    Coming back as Zsa-Zsa 
does not tintinabulate,         Gabor's underwear 
whose smallest robot I am 
unworthy to catalog..." 
<P>
Two months later, a homing pigeon will smash through your living room 
window, dance the lambada with your salt shaker, deposit a small 
capsule and leave. 
<P>
In the capsule will be a small piece of paper with three numbers on 
it. Take these numbers to the Middle Eastern gentleman who runs the 
Slurpee machine at the 7-11. He will nod knowingly and cold cock you. 
<P>
When you wake up in the hospital, you will find more numbers tatooed 
on your chest. Your nurse will look at these numbers and gasp, then 
rip open her blouse to reveal large, firm breasts with more numbers 
tatooed upon them. Put these numbers together and they will spell out 
an exact location in Turkey in latitude and longitude. 
<P>
Buy a plane ticket to Turkey and hike out to the location. After 
digging for several minutes you will encounter a ceramic albatross. 
Break it open. Inside you will find a mystic scripture and three 
pounds of hashish. You will then be arrested by several police 
officers who were hiding behind a tree. 
<P>
When you get inside the prison, seek out the man with no teeth 
performing perversions upon himself in the corner. Ask him about the 
crystal. He will give a large green crystal. Hold it in the air and 
recite the mystic scripture. There will be a big stinky explosion, 
causing the wardens to believe that your colon detonated and you will 
be transported to a small cave. 
<P>
Recite the words on the cave wall a million times without stopping. 
This may take a few tries, but what the hell, you're young! When you 
succeed, a small computer terminal will mysteriously materialize. 
Logon as anonymous and read your mail. The Oracle's reply will be 
there! Probably something along the lines of 
<P>
"Throw chocolate syrup in her face and go watch the Munsters. 
You owe the Oracle a Twinkie" 
<P>
Ah, cosmic knowledge! It's worth any price, is it not? 
<P>
You owe the Oracle a Twinkie.
