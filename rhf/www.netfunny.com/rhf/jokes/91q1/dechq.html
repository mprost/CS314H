Two lions escape from the zoo. They decide that they'd better split 
up, but agree to meet three months later at a given spot. 
<P>
Three months go by and they meet at the appointed place. One is very 
skinny and the other appears very robust. 
<P>
The Robust One (TRO): What happened to you? You look terrible! 
<P>
The Skinny One (TSO): When we split up, I went to a nearby village. 
All I did was to eat one small person, and the villagers got very 
upset. They started chasing me with guns! I've been on the run ever 
since and haven't had a thing to eat since then. 
<P>
TRO: That's too bad. 
<P>
TSO: What about you? You seem to be doing well. 
<P>
TRO: Well, I made my way to Digital headquarters in Maynard. 
<P>
I've been eating a manager a week, and nobody seems to notice. 
<P>
I think this could apply to most conglomerates.
