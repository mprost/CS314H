I put this message on my machine during the baseball season.  In the 
background is the sound effect of a cheering crowd at a baseball game. 
<P>
``We're back at Wrigley Field for this, the final game of the 1990 baseball 
season.  The Cubs and Mets are tied for first, whoever wins this game takes 
home the National League Eastern Division championship. We're in the 9th 
inning, Cubs trailing 2-1, but they have Dunston on third with two 
outs.  Coming up to bat now, here is BOB! (crowd cheers in background)  This 
has been a solid season for Bob, 26 home runs, 87 runs batted in.  A base hit 
now will tie it for the Cubs, while a home  run will give them the 
championship.. 
<P>
"Bob digs in against Dwight Gooden.  Gooden has been masterful today,  striking 
out 16, while only allowing 3 base hits.  Here comes the  pitch . . .   AND 
THERE'S A LONG DRIVE DEEP TO RIGHT!  THAT COULD BE  OUT OF HERE!  DARRYL 
STRAWBERRY RACES OVER AND MAKES A LEAPING CATCH AT THE WALL AND BOB IS OUT!!!! 
Yes, Bob is out, but he'll be happy to return your call as soon as possible." 
<P>

Since I once worked in radio as a newscaster and DJ, I was able to do this so 
that it sounded like an actual radio broadcast.  The response to this 
message, which ran a full 60 seconds, was interesting.  Men loved it, and 
passed my phone number around so that their buddies could call in and hear it. 
Women, in general, didn't understand it, and left messages complaining that it 
was too long, too loud, or didn't make any sense. 
<P>
