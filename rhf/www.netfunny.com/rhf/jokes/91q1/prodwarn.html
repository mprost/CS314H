<CENTER>A Call for More Scientific Truth in Product Warning Labels</CENTER><BR>
<P>
<CENTER>by Susan Hewitt and Edward Subitzky</CENTER><BR>
<P>
As scientists and concerned citizens, we applaud the recent trend 
towards legislation that requires the prominent placing of warnings 
on products that present hazards to the general public. Yet we must 
also offer the cautionary thought that such warnings, however 
well-intentioned, merely scratch the surface of what is really necessary 
in this important area. This is especially true in light of the 
findings of 20th century physics. 
<P>
We are therefore proposing that, as responsible scientists, we 
join together in an intensive push for new laws that will mandate 
the conspicuous placement of suitably informative warnings on the 
packaging of every product offered for sale in the United States of 
America. Our suggested list of warnings appears below. 
<P>
WARNING: This Product Warps Space and Time in Its Vicinity. 
<P>
WARNING: This Product Attracts Every Other Piece of Matter in the 
Universe, Including the Products of Other Manufacturers, with a 
Force Proportional to the Product of the Masses and Inversely 
Proportional to the Distance Between Them. 
<P>
CAUTION: The Mass of This Product Contains the Energy Equivalent 
of 85 Million Tons of TNT per Net Ounce of Weight. 
<P>
HANDLE WITH EXTREME CARE: This Product Contains Minute Electrically 
Charged Particles Moving at Velocities in Excess of Five Hundred 
Million Miles Per Hour. 
<P>
CONSUMER NOTICE: Because of the "Uncertainty Principle," It Is 
Impossible for the Consumer to Find Out at the Same Time Both 
Precisely Where This Product Is and How Fast It Is Moving. 
<P>
ADVISORY: There is an Extremely Small but Nonzero Chance That, 
Through a Process Know as "Tunneling," This Product May Spontaneously 
Disappear from Its Present Location and Reappear at 
Any Random Place in the Universe, Including Your Neighbor's 
Domicile. The Manufacturer Will Not Be Responsible for Any 
Damages or Inconvenience That May Result. 
<P>
READ THIS BEFORE OPENING PACKAGE: According to Certain Suggested 
Versions of the Grand Unified Theory, the Primary Particles 
Constituting this Product May Decay to Nothingness Within 
the Next Four Hundred Million Years. 
<P>
THIS IS A 100% MATTER PRODUCT: In the Unlikely Event That This 
Merchandise Should Contact Antimatter in Any Form, a Catastrophic 
Explosion Will Result. 
<P>
PUBLIC NOTICE AS REQUIRED BY LAW: Any Use of This Product, in 
Any Manner Whatsoever, Will Increase the Amount of Disorder in 
the Universe. Although No Liability Is Implied Herein, the 
Consumer Is Warned That This Process Will Ultimately Lead to 
the Heat Death of the Universe. 
<P>
NOTE: The Most Fundamental Particles in This Product Are Held 
Together by a "Gluing" Force About Which Little is Currently Known 
and Whose Adhesive Power Can Therefore Not Be Permanently Guaranteed. 
<P>
ATTENTION: Despite Any Other Listing of Product Contents Found 
Hereon, the Consumer is Advised That, in Actuality, This Product 
Consists Of 99.9999999999% Empty Space. 
<P>
NEW GRAND UNIFIED THEORY DISCLAIMER: The Manufacturer May 
Technically Be Entitled to Claim That This Product Is Ten-Dimensional. 
However, the Consumer Is Reminded That This 
Confers No Legal Rights Above and Beyond Those Applicable 
to Three-Dimensional Objects, Since the Seven New Dimensions 
Are "Rolled Up" into Such a Small "Area" That They Cannot 
Be Detected. 
<P>
PLEASE NOTE: Some Quantum Physics Theories Suggest That When 
the Consumer Is Not Directly Observing This Product, It May 
Cease to Exist or Will Exist Only in a Vague and Undetermined 
State. 
<P>
COMPONENT EQUIVALENCY NOTICE: The Subatomic Particles (Electrons, 
Protons, etc.) Comprising This Product Are Exactly the Same in 
Every Measurable Respect as Those Used in the Products of Other 
Manufacturers, and No Claim to the Contrary May Legitimately Be 
Expressed or Implied. 
<P>
HEALTH WARNING: Care Should Be Taken When Lifting This Product, 
Since Its Mass, and Thus Its Weight, Is Dependent on Its 
Velocity Relative to the User. 
<P>
IMPORTANT NOTICE TO PURCHASERS: The Entire Physical Universe, 
Including This Product, May One Day Collapse Back into an 
Infinitesimally Small Space. Should Another Universe Subsequently 
Re-emerge, the Existence of This Product in That Universe Cannot 
Be Guaranteed.
