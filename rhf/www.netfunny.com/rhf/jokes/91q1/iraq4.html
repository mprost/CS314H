Here is the latest edition of the Iraq war joke digest.  These are the

<H1 align=center>Iraq Does Not Exist!</H1>
<ADDRESS><CENTER>ata@sage.cc.purdue.edu (Don Dodson)</CENTER></ADDRESS><BR>
<P>
President Bush went on national TV today with a startling 
announcement.  It seems that Iraq does not actually exist. 
<P>
"We've been taught since elementary school that the 
letter 'q' is always followed by 'u'.  It should be 
clear that a country called Iraq cannot exist." 
<P>
The President went on to explain that Desert Storm has 
been a massive simulation to help prepare for the war 
against broccoli. 
<P>
Bush refused to answer accusations that this "technicality" 
was just an excuse to end the war gracefully.

<TITLE>The REAL surrender terms [rec.humor.funny]</TITLE>
<H1 align=center>The REAL surrender terms</H1>
<ADDRESS><CENTER>jms@netcom.com (John Schonholtz)</CENTER></ADDRESS><BR>
<P>
(Original.  Inspired by George Bush's calling Hussein's order of withdrawal 
an "outrage.") 
<P>
1)  Iraqi troops are to surrender all chemical weapons.  Chemical weapons 
are defined as containing such substances as hydrogen cyanide, mustard 
gas, gunpowder, gasoline, and vulcanized rubber. 
<P>
2)  All Iraqi troops are to walk from Kuwait back into Iraq.  Those who 
say unkind words or look at coalition soldiers in an unkind way are 
to crawl back. 
<P>
3)  Iraq must compensate Kuwait for all war reparations, outstanding debts, 
lodging for the duration of the troops' stay in Kuwait, and import 
duties for the weapons left behind. 
<P>
4)  All Iraqi military installations and government ministry are to have 
a bulls-eye at least 15 meters across on top, painted in luminescent 
colors. 
<P>
5)  The battleship Missouri, currently on patrol in the Gulf, will be 
moored near Basra, and the treaty-signing ceremony is to be held 
on board. 
<P>

<H1 align=center>Iraqi Dictionary</H1>
<ADDRESS><CENTER>pt@geovision.UUCP (Paul Tomblin)</CENTER></ADDRESS><BR>
<P>
A sample entry from the new Iraqi Dictionary of Saddam-speak: 
<P>
Victory: [vic-tor-e] n. Total rout by opposing forces, 
complete and utter destruction of your forces by an enemy, 
esp. in war time.  Retreat and surrender.  Known as 
defeat(q.v.) in other countries.

<TITLE>How To Pronounce "Saddam" (original) [rec.humor.funny]</TITLE>
<H1 align=center>How To Pronounce "Saddam" (original)</H1>
<ADDRESS><CENTER>scs@iti.org (Steve Simmons)</CENTER></ADDRESS><BR>
<P>
After seeing the early days of the ground war and the effectiveness of 
the "Saddam Line" defensive system, the correct pronunciation of "Saddam" 
has finally become obvious: "Maginot."

<H1 align=center>Bush's Response to the Hussein Condom</H1>
<ADDRESS><CENTER>murray@vs2.scri.fsu.edu (John R. Murray)</CENTER></ADDRESS><BR>
<P>
Much as I hate to admit it, this is original: 
<P>
By now, I am sure we have all heard about the Saddam Hussein 
Condom - the one for little pricks who don't pull out in time. 
<P>
Not to be outdone, President Bush has released his own 
prophylactic device, the Bush Condom - if the little prick 
doesn't pull out in time, it makes damn sure he doesn't have 
enough equipment left to bother anyone in the future...

Q: Why does the Iraqi Navy have glass bottom boats? 
<P>
A: So they can see their Air Force.

[Heard on a morning radio show] 
<P>
Newscaster:  "Saddam Hussein claims that his forces are winning the war against 
Allied forces."

Q: What does Ted Kennedy have in common with the "luckiest man in 
Iraq" [referring to Gen. Swarzkopf's caption of a video showing

<P>
A: They both know how it feels to be bombed when crossing a bridge.
