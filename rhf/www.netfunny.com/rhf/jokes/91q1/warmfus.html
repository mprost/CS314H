ABSTRACT 
<P>
We report the observation of warm nuclear fusion of deuteron pairs 
catalyzed by a concentrated colloidal suspension of avian lipids. We 
present a simple theoretical model relating this process to superstring 
theory, quantum wormholes, fractal geometry, and high temperature 
superconductors. A straightforward scaling argument shows that the 
total annual energy requirements of the United States can be produced 
from approximately 137.03602 g of catalyst. 
<P>
1. INTRODUCTION 
<P>
Recent observations of cold nuclear fusion of deuteron pairs, through 
electrolysis in solutions of metallic salts, has generated considerable 
excitement in the physics community and elsewhere.  The fusion catalysis 
process described by Fleischmann and Pons does, however, have several 
drawbacks when considered as a putative means of mass power generation. 
The process is slow, requiring a continuous electrical power input of 
several hours before the onset of fusion.  In addition, this process requires 
costly palladium or titanium cathodes, as well as highly toxic combinations 
of dissolved metallic salts. 
<P>
The modified <B>warm</B> fusion process which we have discovered (independently) 
and which is described in this paper suffers none of these disadvantages. 
In our process, the salt solution is augmented by a concentrated colloidal 
suspension of certain avian lipid compounds, available in an inexpensive 
commercial preparation (i.e., Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup) in arbitrarily 
large quantities.  This preparation is not only nontoxic, but actually 
healthful.  Instead of requiring several hours of applied external current, 
our process induces fusion after gentle heating to 90 degrees Celsius, 
maintained for five minutes.  The palladium cathode is replaced by an inexpensive 
chromium-plated utensil, which is given an approximately circular motion 
induced by elementary mechanical means. 
<P>
Since our fusion catalysis technique is so simple, we will not belabor the 
description of the process itself, but instead focus on the analysis of the 
data and present an obvious theoretical model for the underlying physics. 
<P>
2. NEUTRON CALORIMETRY AND DATA ANALYSIS 
<P>
Although, as we shall demonstrate, our warm fusion technique can readily 
produce a net power output in the terawatt range, our initial experimental 
setup operated at a more modest scale.  Rather than resorting to direct 
detection of fusion product neutrons, we employed a highly accurate neutron 
calorimetry procedure.  We first measured the total external power supplied 
to our system.  This involved reading the electric meter on the circuit 
containing our (electrically powered) heating apparatus, and correcting for 
other power drains on the circuit, such as lightbulbs, radios, and video 
cassette recorders.  We then corrected this power reading for the 
electricity/heat conversion efficiency of our apparatus, taken from an authoritative 
source (c.f. <I>The World Book Encyclopedia</I>).  Further corrections were made 
for cosmic ray background radiation incident on our apparatus, energy 
deposition from proton decay within the apparatus, and additional heat from minor 
amounts of paprika contamination. 
<P>
To determine the total energy output from 300 seconds of catalyzed fusion 
events, 400 cc of the solution was ingested by a 75 kg male homo sapien 
volunteer subject.  After a short digestion period, the subject was led 
through a series of mechanical tasks ("The Jane Fonda Ultimate Challenge 
Workout") and the resulting power output--estimated by sophisticated 
nonlinear biodynamic integro-differential hyperelliptic functional analysis, 
simulated numerically on a Cray XMP supercomputer.  Details of this 
analysis will be presented in a future publication. 
<P>
The results of our analysis for a 400 cc catalytic solution were as follows:

3. THEORETICAL MODEL 
<P>
Although our experimental results may seem somewhat surprising to the 
uninitiated, there is a simple theoretical explanation of the underlying 
physics responsible for efficient warm fusion catalysis in lipid 
suspensions.  As is well known, the principal obstacle to deuteron fusion 
is the Coulombic potential barrier induced by the electrostatic repulsion 
of the positively charged particles.  A straightforward application of 
ten-dimensional heterotic superstring dynamics shows that deuterons can 
percolate through the Coulomb barrier through the spontaneous generation 
of quantum wormholes.  One can easily see why this process is enhanced 
in the presence of suspended avian lipids by applying the Anthropic 
Principle.  Obviously, if the laws of physics did not produce such an 
enhancement, we could not have observed it in our universe, and a 
contradiction of our material existence would result.  The perforation of 
the Coulomb barrier by quantum wormholes is elegantly described in terms 
of fractal geometry; an analytic continuation to planar surfaces produces 
analogous electromagnetic anomalies in resonant spin liquids, thus 
explaining the behavior of high temperature superconductors.  Details of 
this model will appear in a future publication. 
<P>
4. FUTURE OUTLOOK 
<P>
We have considered the problem of scaling up our warm fusion technique 
to provide the commercial and strategic defense power requirements of the 
United States.  The appropriate scaling law was obtained by repeating our 
initial experiment, but adding only half as much water to our commercial 
preparation as called for in the instructions.  With this additional 
concentration of the catalytic solution, we obtained a net power output increase 
of 0.00016%.  Clearly, by continuing to halve the amount of added water, we 
can obtain an arbitrarily high power of this enhancement factor, and thus 
any level of power output desired.  We estimate that, by limiting the amount 
of added water to 3 micrograms (easily accomplished through national 
technical means), more than 10 terawatts of warm fusion power could be produced. 
<P>
We strongly urge, and fervently hope, that the power of chicken soup will 
only be used for peaceful purposes.
