Answering machines. Nowadays almost everyone has one, complete with a snappy 
message of their own device. Wait for the BEEP and then read on. 
This is a short adaptation of Simon Butler-White's and Clive Archer's 
"could-be" phone messages released in Australian Cleo, August 1989. 
(Some of them are bit old, Maggie ain't prime minister of the UK, and 
Kylie Minogue isn't seeing Jason Donovan anymore, but you'll get the meaning 
anyway, I'm sure).

You dummy! You've called while I'm OUT! Five minutes You've missed me by AT 
LEAST five minutes. Are you stupid or what? Can't you get anything right? 
You people make me sick! Leave a message and I'll call you back! <B>BEEP</B>.

(Giggle) Hello, this is Fergie...er (sound of hand being placed over 
receiver and a loud whisper). Andrew! What's that title again? What? Oh hello, 
this is the Duchess of York. The Duke and I are out skiing, so when you hear 
the jolly old pip pip, leave your message and we'll give you a tinkle when 
we get back--in November. <B>BEEP</B>.

Hi. I can't come to the phone right now. Actually I can't do much of anything 
right now because I've been dead since 1977. But my spirit lives on and if 
you'd like to leave your name and number, I'll try to contact you via ouija 
board, Madame Zenda or garbled tape recording. This is also the number of 
John F. Kennedy, Adolf Hitler, Harold Holt, Lucille Ball, Roy Orbison...<B>BEEP</B>.

the glorious Communist Party of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, 
Commander-In-Chief of the Combined Armies of the Proletariat Peoples of 
Russia, First Citizen of the Order of Lenin, Supreme Patron of the Soviet 
Institute of Literature and Domestic Sciences, President of the Soviet 
People's Council of Peace and Happiness and Captain of the Kremlin B Squash 
Team. But hey, call me Mike. <B>BEEP</B>.
