Did you hear the one about the day Oral Roberts, Jerry Falwell and Robert 
Schuler were driving to a big "tent meeting" together?  Unfortunately, 
they were involved in a terrible accident and all three were killed. 
As you might expect they all ascended into heaven and came to standing in 
front of the Pearly Gates.  St. Peter greeted them and welcomed them to 
heaven.  Then he started to hem and haw around and finally explained that 
they hadn't any advance notice of this situation and so weren't quite 
prepared for three so illustrious and holy men.  He explained how all 
three of them qualified for the very finest accommodations heaven had to 
offer including very large and splendid mansions, but they weren't quite 
ready so would they mind waiting a few days? 
<P>
They replied that they wouldn't mind waiting, but were they just going 
to have to stand there for several days?  St. Peter said no, he 
believed he could arrange temporary quarters for them in Hell.  Sometimes 
Satan was willing to help out in emergencies, whereupon he placed a call 
to Brother Satan and made the arrangements.  They descended into Hell. 
<P>
Noon on the fourth day after their descent St. Peter gets a frantic 
phone call from the Devil demanding that he remove these three guys from 
hell immediately.  St. Peter couldn't believe his ears and asked what 
could possibly be wrong with these three upstanding people. 
<P>
The Devil replied, "They are ruining my place down here.  In less than 
four days Jerry Falwell has saved everybody, Oral Roberts has healed 
everybody, and Robert Schuler has raised enough money to air condition 
the whole damn place!!"
