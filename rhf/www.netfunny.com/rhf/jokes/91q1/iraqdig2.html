Have you seen the types of people going to anti-war protests?  Some look quite 
like a freak show...  Do you know why they want to "bring the troops home?" 
Because they can't wait to get their hands on all the surplus Army boots.

The War in the Persian Gulf gives the opportunity for the first true

This is original to me, and started as a response to an 
Oracle Question. 
<P>
If you've never seen Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day in 
<I>The Man Who Knew Too Much</I>, you should really make 
an effort.  Doris Day sings "Que Sera Sera" to her 
kid, who by the end of the film is pretty shook up. 
Here's the new version, updated for current events: 
<P>
<PRE>    When I was just a little boy 
    I asked my mother, what will I be? 
    Will I be handsome,  
	will I be rich? 
    Here's what she said to me: 
<P>
    Hey Saddam, Saddam, 
    Whatever will be will be 
    But you're messing with Mean Marines, 
    Hey Saddam, Saddam. 
<P>
    When I was just a boy in school 
    I asked my teacher, what should I try? 
    Should I try gassing,  
	or making bombs? 
    Here was her wise reply: 
<P>
    Hey Saddam, Saddam.... 
<P>
    When I grew up and joined the war, 
    I asked my Sergeant, will I be brave? 
    Will I kick asses,  
	will I take names? 
    Here's what he screamed and raved: 
<P>
    Hey Saddam, Saddam.... 
<P>
    When I sent troops into Kuwait The 19th Province 
    I asked my Generals, how will we do? 
    How long 'till victory  
        is in our hands? 
    These words they spoke were true: 
<P>
    Hey Saddam, Saddam.... 
<P>
    Now I have armies of my own 
    They ask their leader will we survive? 
    Down in the bunkers, 
	Where the bombs fall, 
    They know I'm still alive! 
<P>
    Hey Saddam, Saddam, 
    I guess that we'll all know soon, 
    'Cause Norm has a plan for doom! 
    Hey Saddam, Saddam 
        What will be, will be.

<TITLE>Smart Weapons [rec.humor.funny]</TITLE>
<H1 align=center>Smart Weapons</H1>
<ADDRESS><CENTER>gscott@portia.stanford.edu</CENTER></ADDRESS><BR>
<P>
(This is original.) 
<P>
Early reports from the Persian Gulf have sung the praises of our smart 
weapons.  The cruise missiles would first stop by the Baghdad Post Office 
to see if the target had filed a change of address, then head down the 
main boulevard, carefully observing all traffic lights.  Upon reaching 
the target, the missile would knock on the door, display the correct 
password to gain entrance, and penetrate deeply into the building before 
detonating. 
<P>
The precision of those weapons is most impressive, but I have a different 
concept of a truly "smart" weapon.  It would say to 
the designer, "You want me to crash into a concrete wall and explode?  No, 
no, no.  Let me have a chat with the man.  Give me a letter of 
introduction, `A Mr. Thomas Hauke to see Saddam Hussein' or 
words to that effect.  I'd say to him, `You realize that I'm carrying a 
half-ton of explosive, and if I were to carry out my intended mission, well, 
it would be an enormous headache for your maintenance staff. 
I'd much prefer to have a spot of tea and discuss the latest video technology. 
If you'd be a good man and withdraw from Kuwait, I'm sure we could 
reach an amicable agreement.'" 
<P>
I suppose that there are some problems with my scheme.  Contemplative weapons 
might reflect on their purpose in the universe, and too much of the wrong flavor 
of existentialism could have a devastating effect.  "Whether I destroy an 
Iraqi or Saudi airbase is a matter of complete indifference to the universe." 
There's nothing more dangerous than a nihilistic missile. 
<P>
For the time being, I suspect that while designers will continue to make 
weapons more "intelligent," in the sense of being able to perform more 
complex tasks, they will still pursue their missions with the single-mindedness 
of an untenured professor.  The weapons, that is. 
<P>
