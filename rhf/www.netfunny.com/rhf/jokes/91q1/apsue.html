Apple Corporation Sues Itself. 
<P>
[AP] In a move that has industrial analysts scratching their heads, 
Apple Computers has filed suit against Apple Computer, Inc.  The 
company claims that Apple has violated the Look and Feel of their own 
machines which has helped to make the company famous. 
<P>
An Apple Spokesperson stated "This is no joke.  If we don't protect our 
copyrighted interface, everyone will use it and we could lose the 
exclusive right.  So it is in our best interests to sue anyone who uses 
the Macintosh Look and Feel, including ourselves."  The spokesperson 
says Apple has retained the prestigious LA law firm of Kukla, Fran and 
Ollie to spearhead the lawsuit.  Apple's in house lawyers will defend. 
<P>
Long time Apple observer Ernest Dinklefwat stated that this is a sure 
sign that Apple has too many lawyers and not enough engineers.  "In the 
old days Apple depended on its talented engineers to keep ahead of the 
competition, but now they have lost the edge, as well as their grasp on 
reality." 
<P>
The industry will be sure to watch this case closely.  If Apple wins 
the suit against itself, this could mean a massive recall of all 
Macintosh and Lisa computers which will need to be converted to avoid 
all graphics and desktop metaphors and instead provide a simple 
terminal-like interface.  Such a move would cause a massive digression 
in the personal computer market.  Users of computers would be forced to 
learn to read, which could cause dangerous literacy among college 
students and professionals.
