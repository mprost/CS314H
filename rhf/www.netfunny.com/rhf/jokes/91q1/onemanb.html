Here's a soulful little ditty sung to the tune of "One Night In Bangkok" 
from the musical "Chess." Lyrics by Michael T. Rose and Javier 
Grillo-Marxuach. 
<P>
<STRONG>[Ed: Congratulations.  I usually don't do song parodies, as they rarely 
work in written form....]</STRONG> 
<P>
<H4>Our Man In Baghdad</H4>
<P>
<PRE>Baghdad! 
Middle Eastern city. 
And the city don't know what the city will get. 
The creme de la creme of the arsenal in a raid with  
everything but Dan Quayle. 
<P>
Bombs fly! Doesn't seem a minute since the last one fell  
with some nerve gas in it. 
No chance! Hop into the shelter 
Sitting under fire and your skin begins to swelter 
<P>
It's Cambodia; or Vietnam; or Dresden; or... or this place! 
<P>
Chorus: 
<P>
Our man in Baghdad 
Calls in to Atlanta 
Not much between the press and shell debris 
<P>
We'll hear his broadcast underneath our gas masks 
And if I'm lucky, Scuds won't fall on me 
I can hear an air raid siren close to me 
<P>
One bomb's very like another 
when your head's down under the table, brother 
It's a blast! It's a scream! It's really quite a thrill 
To be out here in the rubble; we're examining the last kill 
<P>
Wait a minute!  If you've seen one network's retired 
military commentators... 
<P>
Skin lice! Open sores! We're not afraid  
of the mustard gas pustules 
<P>
Ca-ble! You're looking at a newsman 
Who's every phrase is out on the tube, man 
I get my news <B>before</B> the networks, Brokaw! 
<P>
I don't see Rather reading the kind of scoops 
I'm postulating 
I'd give you Pete; I'll take Wolf Blitzer 
And the Times will print "whatever fits her." 
<P>
And you better believe that Saddam is watching 
...from his bunker 
<P>
Chorus: 
<P>
Our Man in Baghdad 
Makes the war seem simple 
He's got a platitude for every shot 
<P>
He's not afraid of going over budget 
And if we're lucky, the Allies won't choke 
I can smell a story in the acrid smoke 
<P>
Chorus repeats, and out...
