In a village in South America there was a young man who was what some people 
call a Cassanova, good with the ladies.  He had all kinds of ladies. He liked 
them all, fat ones, short ones, skinny ones, didn't matter. The trouble was that 
he had a true love, a virgin that he was saving for his marriage.  This 
innocent virgin, her name was Mary, did not know anything about sex.  Of 
course our Tiger of the Village wanted to keep things that way.  Well finally 
they were married and on the wedding night Mary was very impressed with sex. 
She told her new husband that she did not know a man was built that way.  What 
a wonderful thing men had to please women.  Our Tiger did not want to her to 
think that all men were the same, so he told her, "I tell you something, 
Honey, I am the only man in the world with such a thing."  She believed him. 
<P>
The "Tiger" of the village was a sheep herder and had to go to the hills for 
weeks at a time.  He had been gone for a couple of weeks when he came back and 
began to look for his new bride.  When he got to their hut she wasn't there. 
He then went down through the village looking for her. "Mary, Mary, where are 
you?" Finally he meets up with her on the street. Mary appears to be very 
angry and frustrated. "You son-a-bitch, bastard, cabron, desgrasiado, no good 
for nothing" and begins to hit and fight with him.  "Hey whoa, what's the 
matter baby, what did I do? I didn't do nothing why you mad at me?" our tiger 
asks. 
<P>
Mary says, "Yeah, you asshole, you know Sancho, the lazy one from across the 
street? Well he has one also" and she points to his genitals.  Our hero thinks 
about it, she must have seen this guy taking a leak, shit I can fix this. 
"Hey Honey, I tell you one something, you know what? Sancho he is my best 
friend, I used to have two of them and since Sancho is my friend, I give him 
one," he is all smiles and goes over to hug Mary. 
<P>
Mary is now angrier and begins to clobber the shit out of him.  "You dumb ass, 
pendejo, stupido, ignorante," she yells at him, "YOU GAVE HIM THE BEST ONE."
