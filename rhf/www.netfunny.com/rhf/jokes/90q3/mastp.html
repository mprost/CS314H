<PRE>[One day when I was praying I suddenly realized that I was talking to
myself.  It was then that I came up with the following story.  
-- the preceding joke is NOT original, but the following story is.]


 v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v
 &gt;                                                                         &lt;
 &lt;  /--\                                                                   &gt;
 &gt;  |  |nce upon a time there was a Master Programmer who created three    &lt;
 &lt;  \--/   intelligent processes.  He started all these processes up       &gt;
 &gt;        with no information about the world.  After a while He came      &lt;
 &lt;     back to the processes.  The first process printed out "I think      &gt;
 &gt;   therefore I am," and continued deriving philosophy from first         &lt;
 &lt;   principles.  The Master Programmer looked upon the process and saw    &gt;
 &gt;   that it was good (though He made a note to himself that the next      &lt;
 &lt;   process that He would write wouldn't fall into the Cartesian          &gt;
 &gt;   Circle).  The second process printed "I don't believe in the Master   &lt;
 &lt;   Programmer.  Fuck the Master Programmer."  The Master Programmer      &gt;
 &gt;   laughed and watched the process evolve its ideas.  Finally, the       &lt;
 &lt;   Master Programmer looked at the third process.  The third process     &gt;
 &gt;   was printing "I love the Master Programmer.  I love the Master        &lt;
 &lt;   Programmer.  I love the Master Programmer..." over and over.  The     &gt;
 &gt;   Master Programmer could see that this process was caught in an        &lt;
 &lt;   infinite loop, so He sent it a kill -9 signal.                        &gt;
 &gt;                                                                         &lt;
 v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v^v
