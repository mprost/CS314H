[ Original collator is Bob Dowling, RJD4@UK.AC.CAMBRIDGE.PHOENIX ] 
<P>
1988 
<P>
(contd..) 
<P>
and another one from a 1A Engineering maths lecture : 
<P>
"Graphs of higher degree polynomials have this habit of doing unwanted 
wiggly things." 
<P>
It is said of some things in maths that a mathematician should read the 
proofs precisely once. 
<P>
"I don't want to go into this in detail, but I would like to illustrate some 
of the tedium." 
<P>
From a <I>single</I> seminar at the King's College Research Centre: 
<P>
"I'm sure it's right whether it's valid or not." 
<P>
"Damn the torpedoes. Full speed ahead." 
<P>
"I can see T is tending to infinity for you as well." 
<P>
"If I am incomprehensible then stop me, but if it's simply wrong then I don't 
think that it matters." 
<P>
From a supervisor: 
<P>
"It's a standard question, made a bit harder by adding some A-level stuff." 
<P>
An introduction to the summation convention: 
<P>
"If you've got a problem with this then go back, write the whole thing out 
using sigma notation and convince yourself that it's better not to have 
problems." 
<P>
And from the University of Bath... 
<P>
"A one by one matrix has one column and one row, and the same number 
in both. " 
<P>
"Using some hand-waving and symmetry ideas... " 
<P>
"You haven't written it in green - your notes will be wrong. " 
<P>
"Any Questions? [pause] You all look asleep - what is it, 
hyperglucocemia? Too much sugar on your cornflakes? Not any 
cornflakes? Never mind - I'm bright eyed and bushy tailed, so let's 
continue." 
<P>
Meanwhile, back in Cambridge... 
<P>
"This is known as the 'Toytown solution'.  Actually, there is a more 
technical term for it ..." 
<P>
And from the DPMMS common room... 
<P>
"Of course this is true for more general values of 5" 
<P>
"Not so much a double coset table, more a pile of junk" 
<P>
A brief conversation - 
<P>
"What have we not got?" 
<P>
"No we have not" 
<P>
"No we don't" 
<P>
"We have not got not" 
<P>
"Ah, Not is what we have not got!" 
-Agreement followed. 
<P>
...what do they put in the coffee?? 
<P>
From an applied maths supervisor (a part III student): 
"All numbers are totally irrelevant, unless you're doing Astrophysics." 
"However well you do [in your Tripos exams] you always find there's someone 
from Trinity who's beaten you." 
<P>
I'm told that countability isn't taught in IA anymore. It doesn't seem to have 
been taught to this Part III lecturer at all! 
<P>
"Damn! I'm running out of integers!" 
<P>
<HR>
1989: 
<P>
Anonymous supervisor, talking about Relativistic Electrodynamics: 
<P>
"There are some bits at the end of the course I don't really 
understand, but the students don't normally get that far." 
<P>
From an EIST lecturer: 
<P>
"When you stick your fingers in the mains, its not the imaginary component 
which you will feel" 
<P>
From substitute lecturer, replacing the scheduled appearance by Dr. X: 
<P>
"Good morning.  For those of you who don't know me, I am not Dr. X; 
I am Dr. X's representative on Earth." 
<P>
And from my source in Bath... 
<P>
"Now, I want you to look very carefully at what we have just proved. 
What we have just proved is false." [slight pause while what he has 
just said sinks in] "Oh dear, that's going to go onto the computer, 
isn't it." 
<P>
[ Fame at last ! ] 
<P>
"I'll give you a clue - it begins with `f' and rhymes with `factor'..." 
- Lecturer to a 1st year problem class 
<P>
"The object of this lecture is to frighten half of you away." 
<P>
"I wrote my first program in 1954, and that didn't work either." 
<P>
"That is the total and absolute generalisation ... well, almost." 
<P>
Back in Cambridge, explanations are up to their usual standards... 
<P>
"Perhaps it would be best if this argument remained a deep mystery to you." 
<P>
"One property which we know very well happens; a+b=b+c." 
(for all a,b,c?) 
<P>
"I shall explain this by waving my hands about in an appropriate manner." 
<P>
"What I've talked about today seems to be uniquely incoherent ... 
I never know if you're as baffled as me, or if you're getting along fine." 
<P>
And our first candidate for the Sybil Fawlty prize for "Stating the Bleeding 
Obvious": 
<P>
"g inverse is called an inverse to g." 
<P>
"This is not really a convention, it's just the normal way of doing things." 
<P>
The things Cambridge does to a lecturer... 
<P>
"Dr. X hasn't lectured a Cambridge group before, so he might be quite 
interesting." 
<P>
"Some students may feel that the contents of Question 33 are both dull and 
useless. I must confess that my first impulse is to reply that it serves them 
right for doing the fast course." 
<P>
From the wonderful world of IA Natsci: 
<P>
"Whenever the maths turns out to be impossible, you have to invent new 
physics." 
<P>
A depressed first year... 
<P>
"I used to be without hope - but now various people have assured me 
that failing the exams is more difficult than Green's functions." 
<P>
"There are ways of managing without cuts, but I do not think the present 
Government is going to find them" - IB Complex variable, October 1979. 
<P>
"I've never tried dividing both sides by infinity before, so here goes." 
<P>
"It's OK to divide by zero, provided you don't cancel it." 
<P>
"It's a <I>real</I> integer, not just any old integer." 
<P>
For once a quote meant to be humourous: 
<P>
"To a mathematician, PI is 1 and PI^2 is 10. 2*PI we're not quite sure about." 
<P>
Descriptions of assorted mathematicians: 
<P>
"He's not just an experimentalist. He's an antitheorist!" 
<P>
"He gets lost on random walks." 
<P>
"Some inspired joker - probably Maxwell." 
<P>
"This is the simple form. [pause] Well, it's simple in the sense that it leaves 
out all the really important bits." 
<P>
"...as Poincare' proved at the beginning of this talk..." 
<P>
"This is obvious. But don't look at it too carefully, or it becomes unobvious, 
until you look at it for a long time when it becomes obvious again." 
<P>
"I need two hands to wave, not just one." 
<P>
"FORTRAN... Then, as now, the language used by scientists with real problems." 
<P>
"Suitably interpreted, this is an exact value." 
<P>
And from the depths of historical apocrypha... 
Supervisor (drawing a graph): "This function has no nodes." 
(Pause) 
"How does it smell?" 
<P>
A good enough philosophy of life: 
<P>
"Theoretical physicists tend to assume that Nature isn't as malevolent as 
our pure mathematical examiners." 
<P>
The following shouldn't really be here but I couldn't resist it: 
Tourist outside DAMTP: "I think it used to be a church." 
<P>
"Bear with me until my starting transient has settled down into doing things 
properly from the notes." 
<P>
"And now, a few examples of fatigue from [my] vast experience." 
<P>
Do we have a Dr. Hobson in the faculty? 
<P>
"If there is a choice, you've got to do it." 
<P>
"Different may mean the same." 
<P>
Picture this... 
<P>
"A sphere isn't that simple when you get into higher dimensions 
- it's a bit non-flat." 
<P>
And those fascinating results come thick and fast in this course: 
<P>
"There are 9 results in there - it looks like it's going to be tedious, and 
indeed it is." 
<P>
Sometimes I think they make Quantum Mechanics deliberately obscure... 
<P>
"There's a number down here which, for the sake of argument, we can 
call 1." 
<P>
Precision? What precision? 
<P>
"We have a correspondence that's nearly one-to-one." 
<P>
And a couple of remarks from the students... 
<P>
"Mathmos think of engineers a bit like lemmings... 
...they're both wooly and jump to the wrong conclusions." 
<P>
"I don't see the point of lecturers talking, except to resolve some of the 
ambiguities in their handwriting." 
<P>
"Various people with suicidal tendencies can even integrate elliptic functions" 
<P>
Said of Algebra III: 
<P>
"This course could be viewed as 1001 things to do with your favourite matrix" 
<P>
The problems that the maths societies have to overcome to get their audience! 
<P>
"Why weren't you at the meeting?" 
<P>
"Because it was boring." 
<P>
"No it wasn't." 
<P>
"Well, it <I>should</I> have been!" 
<P>
Oh, the joys of dual lecturing! 
<P>
"I was going to say 'the cream of the nation's youth', but they're probably at 
the other lecturer." 
<P>
The secret of Pure Mathematics: 
<P>
"...interpreting out of all recognition..." 
<P>
The black art of applied mathematics... 
<P>
"It is traditional to leave the notation ambiguous." 
...and talking about the black arts... 
<P>
"For non-deterministic read 'Inhabited by pixies'." 
<P>
And if that wasn't confusing enough... 
<P>
"I thought I understood Newton's Third Law before that lecture." 
<P>
"This is equation 2, which implies that equation 3 comes someplace earlier." 
<P>
"Unless x is a banana or some other such object that commutes with A." 
<P>
And this year's honesty award must surely go for the following two gems from 
the same lecturer... 
<P>
"I'm going to make a small point in the corner of the board [does so], and come 
back to it later!" 
And later... 
<P>
"The thing which caused me to write 'lies' in extremely small letters in the 
corner of the board was..." 
<P>
And later still... 
<P>
"When you see this, you are entitled to go ` Y'what?! '." 
<P>
A possible candidate for the Tautology Award? 
<P>
"If we want to take the westerly winds into account, we could also do that 
using this method, but then we'd have to take the westerly winds into 
account." 
<P>
"This type of rotor is known as a squirrel-cage rotor because the way it's 
wound looks like a bird cage." 
<P>
CompSci meets Zoology? 
<P>
"What we're trying to do is work things out about elephants." 
<P>
<HR>
1990: 
<P>
A nomination for the Sybil Fawlty "Stating the Bleedin' Obvious" Prize: 
<P>
"A polynomial f is said to have degree m, written deg f equals m, if it does 
have degree m." 
<P>
Now it is fairly well known that lectures are not supposed to be copied down 
mindlessly. But... 
<P>
"Recall word 2 of defn 2.1" 
But then again... 
<P>
"I know you all have very innocent minds, but occasionally a word should be 
allowed to wander through before reaching the paper." 
<P>
And on the subject of teaching styles: 
<P>
"Proof left as an exercise for your supervisor." 
<P>
And this year's first contenders for the Tautology award: 
<P>
"It's obvious that what I've just written down is obvious." 
<P>
"The fixed element can be said to be exactly what it is." 
<P>
Mathematical notation is a minefield of obscure symbols ranging over most 
alphabets and scriptstyles. Any guesses for which character was described by an 
undergraduate as: 
<P>
"It's a script spider"? 
<P>
And with the reading problems come the corresponding writing ones suffered by 
these lecturers: 
<P>
"My script 'y's always end up looking like rabbits." 
<P>
"Little mouse tensored with piece of cheese." 
<P>
However, good notation has its rewards as described by this lecturer: 
<P>
"The prime leaps on to the other factor in a most convenient fashion." 
<P>
And now, back to the content of the lecture courses: 
<P>
"You can hardly underestimate the importance of this." 
<P>
"I've got a lot to say about this theorem, so don't stop me if I go too fast." 
<P>
"Sometimes it's useful to know how large your zero is" 
<P>
Three from the same lecturer who is clearly having real problems... 
<P>
"What am I doing? I haven't written any damn thing yet - I've just written 
total rubbish." 
<P>
"What am I talking about? Does anyone know what I'm talking about? This 
is rubbish." 
<P>
"Every time I go to the board with these notes I write down something completely 
different." 
<P>
Hmmm... do I detect someone almost as cynical as myself? 
<P>
"Theoretical physicist - a physicist whose existence is postulated, to make the 
numbers balance, but who is never actually observed in the laboratory." 
<P>
A IB Chemistry lecturer, refering to a previously derived equation. 
<P>
"This is rigorous.  Well, it's rigorous in the sense that ... All right, 
it's not rigorous." 
<P>
Certain calulations will always be CPU intensive... 
<P>
"This principle is sometimes known as assuming the CIA is paying our computing 
bills." 
<P>
Letter from an editor: 
<P>
"I very much regret to inform you that the review procedure of your paper 
'Approximation of Delay systems by Fourier-Laguerre series', is incurring a 
delay..." 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The end (as of 5th July 1990).
