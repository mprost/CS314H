<CENTER>A GUIDE TO PROPER ETIQUETTE IN THE MEN'S RESTROOM</CENTER><BR>
<P>
Ever since man crawled out of the primordial ooze, he has built himself 
structures to contain the processes of bodily waste removal.  These 
have been known as "restrooms," "bathrooms," "outhouses," "commodes," 
"men's rooms," and several other names.  As with any exclusive 
organization, wholy half the human race aren't allowed through the 
door, and a number of exceedingly complicated customs have arisen to 
maintain a sense of order and dignity. 
<P>
<H4>General rules:</H4>
<P>
1.  Don't talk to somebody you don't know.  You may chat quietly with 
an acquaintance, but must absolutely not call attention to yourself. 
<P>
2.  A quick glance in the mirror is permissible, but absolutely don't 
spend a significant time arranging hair, clothing, etc.  Zit popping 
is only permissable after checking to see nobody else is around. 
<P>
3.  No profanity of any kind.  This is reserved for locker rooms, only. 
<P>
4.  If you must wait, form a single-file line, ragged, and be sure to 
keep looking around.  Read graffiti. 
<P>
<H4>Graffiti rules:</H4>
<P>
5.  All graffiti is anonymous.  If there's any chance somebody can trace 
your graffiti back to you, don't do it. 
<P>
6.  Writing graffiti in the open section of the bathroom is only 
acceptable if nobody can see you.  Writing in the stalls is similarly 
acceptable. 
<P>
7.  If the bathroom is sufficiently public, feel free to insult different 
ethnic/racial/sexual groups.  If the bathroom is used by a small 
few, restrain comments to amusing anecdotes or chit-chat about 
secretaries.  If visiting dignitaries from other companies or the 
government may tend to use the bathroom, graffiti is forbidden. 
<P>
8.  Traditionally, all pictures feature women in various states of undress. 
Modern standards often include portions of male anatomy, discretely 
placed.  Homosexual graffiti is generally frowned upon but is 
gaining popularity. 
<P>
9.  Pictures must only be drawn in toilet stalls. 
<P>
10. Any sufficiently interesting graffiti will be painted over by 
the management of the bathroom. 
<P>
<H4>Urinal rules:</H4>
<P>
11. Given a string of unoccupied urinals, you must choose one on the 
outside.  When one outside urinal is occupied, use the other side, 
then middle.  Avoid standing directly next to somebody at all costs. 
<P>
For example, given seven urinals, here are acceptable configurations: 
<P>
<!--  in 0.4in-->
<blockquote><P>
<BR><tt>X......</tt>    (X == occupied, . == empty)<BR>
<tt>X.....X</tt><BR>
<tt>X..X..X</tt><BR>
<tt>X.X.X.X</tt><BR>
<tt>XXX.X.X</tt>  &lt;-- These are only acceptable when significant<BR>
<tt>XXX.XXX</tt>  &lt;-- "privacy" dividers are available.  If the<BR>
<tt>XXXXXXX</tt>  &lt;-- urinals aren't divided, use a toilet.<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
12. Always look at the wall.  Looking down means you're obsessed or don't 
know what you're doing.  Looking at other people is threatening. 
<P>
13. Flushing is optional.  Over time, the water will become a rich orange. 
At this point, flushing is mandatory. 
<P>
14. Don't start unzipping until you're protected by the privacy of the 
urinal.  Don't step back until you've closed your pants again. 
<P>
<H4>Toilet rules:</H4>
<P>
15. Reduce noise at all costs.  Grunting is not acceptable. 
<P>
16. Always flush. 
<P>
17. When you find an unflushed toilet, leave it alone and use another. 
<P>
<H4>Special cases:</H4>
<P>
18. Some university dormitories have co-ed bathrooms.  New rules apply 
for dealing with the females. 
a. Never, ever, comment on how they look in the morning. 
b. Don't ask what the little wastebasket is for. 
c. If urinals are present, only use them when absolutely no females 
are around.  If you are noticed by a female, try your best to 
ignore her presense until you're dressed again. 
<P>
19. Port-O-Let's and similar constructions are evil.  Use them only 
if absolutely no other option is available. 
<P>
20. In the woods, far from civilization, restrooms typically aren't 
available.  Get behind sufficient growth that you are completely 
invisible to the remainder of your party, before you begin. 
Check carefully that you aren't near any sort of animal or 
insect den.  Ants are especially bad.  If you forgot toilet 
paper, bring a leaf identifying guide.  Poison oak makes 
a poor substitute. 
<P>
