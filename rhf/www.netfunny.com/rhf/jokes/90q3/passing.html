[ Told by the C.O. of HMAS Nirimba at a mess dinner in 1976 ]. 
<P>
In a nearly empty London bar on a filthy winter's day, there were 
several patrons quietly drinking when in comes your stereotypical 
American visitor, obviously unimpressed by the country, its 
weather and everything else about it. 
<P>
He says loudly: 
"What a lousy country. The bars are shut half the time, it's cold, 
wet and windy, the beer tastes like piss and is served at the same 
temperature, the streets are packed and you can't even get a cab." 
<P>
Several people quietly leave. 
<P>
He looks at a gentleman quietly sipping a pink gin and says: 
"Hey, limey: how can you bear to live in such a miserable place?" 
<P>
He is ignored, more people leave.  After much more of this only 
the gentleman with the pink gin, the barman and the American are 
left. 
<P>
He says: 
"Hey, limey: I'm talking to you.  I've been to damn near every 
country in the world and this is the lousiest.  I dunno how 
you can bear to live here.  This country is just the arsehole 
of the world." 
<P>
The gentleman with the pink gin pauses, takes another sip and, 
turning, delicately enquires of the American: 
"Oh, yes.  Just passing through, are you?" 
<P>
