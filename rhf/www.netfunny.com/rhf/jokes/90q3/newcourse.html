I recently posted to the following article to our local newsgroup and got a 
favorable response from several people.  Hope you like it...

<CENTER>NOTICE OF CHANGE IN COURSE SCHEDULE</CENTER><BR>
<P>
Due to the well-publicized budget crunch at UNC, the Fall 1990 graduate 
computer science course schedule has undergone some changes.  The following 
corrections take place immediately : 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<BR><B>Replacing:</B> COMP 122 (ALGORITHMS AND ANALYSIS):<BR>
COMP 123     ALGORITHMS AND PSYCHOANALYSIS<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Investigation into the motives of famous algorithm designers.  Anal 
retentive behavior among sort developers.  Gardening habits of Prim, Kruskal, 
Adel'son-Vel'skii, and Landis.  Examples of Dijkstra's lecture tour routes. 
Karp's early career as a brush salesman.  Scavenger hunt successes of Boyer 
and Moore, with discussion of recent losses to some new guy. 
<P>
REQUIRED TEXT: <I>The Psychology of Computer Programming</I>, Weinberg. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<BR><B>Replacing:</B> COMP 171 (NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING):<BR>
COMP 175     SUPERNATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Tools and techniques in computer analysis of psychic communication. 
Syntactic and semantic models of telepathy.  Technical considerations for 
power outages, especially within the context of the seance.  Implications 
of "ghosts in the machine."  Investigation of various interface strategies, 
including tarot card readers, crystal trackballs, and ouija mousepads. 
<P>
REQUIRED TEXT: Time-Life <I>Mysteries of the Unknown</I>.  Students will 
be required to READ THE BOOK. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<BR><B>Replacing:</B> COMP 213 (FILES AND DATABASES):<BR>
COMP 215     FILES NAND DATABASES<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Due to budgetary limitations, the subject matter for this course 
will be necessarily abridged.  We might cover files; we might not.  Ditto 
for databases.  But we certainly won't cover both.  As a matter of fact, we 
might not cover anything!  Prerequisite: COMP 216 (Digital Logic Techniques), 
just to figure out your options. 
<P>
REQUIRED TEXT: Maybe. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<BR><B>Replacing:</B> COMP 217 (INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES):<BR>
COMP 218     INTRODUCTION IN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Investigation of techniques (in various programming paradigms) of 
creating the "Hello World" program.  Generalization to other useless programs. 
Introduction to NP-easy problems. 
<P>
REQUIRED TEXT: <I>I Didn't Know You Could Do That With A Computer!</I> 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<BR><B>Replacing:</B> COMP 233 (DISCRETE EVENT SIMULATION):<BR>
COMP 235     DISCREET EVENT SIMULATION<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Virtual realization of scenarios that most of us geeks will never 
experience in real-life.  Digitization of glossy pictures.  Redesign of 
WalkThru, and possible renaming of same.  Techniques for interfacing with 
various 1-900 numbers.  Course project required; may need to be evaluated 
several times by instructor. 
<P>
REQUIRED TEXT: It's a secret. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<BR><B>Replacing:</B> COMP 238 (RASTER GRAPHICS):<BR>
COMP 239     RASTA GRAPHICS<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Hey mon.  Let me tell you, mon, you'll be likin' this course.  We 
be jammin' to many important concepts, mon.  Rendering dreadlocks, mon. 
Synchronization with MIDI sources of reggae, mon.  Debugging with voodoo, 
mon.  You get the picture; get it, mon, "get the picture"?  I be seeing 
you, mon.  Take the course. 
<P>
REQUIRED TEXT: None, but bring your Marley and Tosh cassettes. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<BR><B>Replacing:</B> COMP 290-1 (EXPERT SYSTEMS):<BR>
COMP 290-3   NOVICE SYSTEMS<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Design, implementation, and testing of systems that simulate computer 
novices.  Observation and analysis of real novices in Mac Lab.  Course 
project required; end-of-semester demonstration constitutes substantial 
portion of grade.  "Optimal" NS's will behave erratically at this demo: 
complaining, crying, copying other students' disks, failing to do rudimentary 
documentation, and bothering COMP 4 and 14 TA's to distraction.  Extra 
credit given for creative program generation. 
<P>
REQUIRED TEXT: <I>Pascal</I>, Koffman, but students are not allowed to 
refer to it at any time. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<BR><B>Replacing:</B> COMP 290-2 (HIGHLY PARALLEL PROGRAMMING):<BR>
COMP 290-4   HIGHLY PERPENDICULAR PROGRAMMING<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Design of multiprocessor machines, with the emphasis being on 
non-cooperation among the nodes.  Geometric theorem-proving by computer, 
with varying approaches to internal representation of compass and 
straightedge.  Introduction to truly orthogonal programming constructs. 
<P>
REQUIRED TEXT: Who'd write a text on this? 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<BR><B>Replacing:</B> COMP 291 (PROFESSIONAL WRITING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE):<BR>
COMP 292     CONFESSIONAL WRITING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE<BR>
<P>
</PRE>This course further emphasizes UNC's strong commitment to building 
a real sense of ethics in its students.  If you're bound and determined to 
cheat on the job, this course will provide you with the writing skills to 
confess about it later.  Through successive drafts, students refine their 
public catharsis to a razor-sharpness that any politician would find 
enviable.  Special guest lecturers: Jimmy Swaggart, Robert Morris, Jr. 
<P>
REQUIRED TEXT: None--the STUDENTS write the book.
