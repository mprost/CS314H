Heard from a Filipino friend at a cast party: 
<P>
These two Polish hunters are out in the woods.  They are lucky enough to 
bag a moose--a really big buck with a nice spread of antlers. 
<P>
Flushed with satisfaction and eager to get their trophy home, they 
proceed to grab hold of the moose's tail and start pulling the carcass 
out of the woods.  They pull and pull and pull but it won't budge. 
<P>
Finally a fellow hunter comes by and says, "Excuse me for offering some 
advice--but you might find it easier to haul that thing by the 
horns."  The two Polish hunters are ecstatic to hear this!  Thanking the 
visitor heartily, they each grab an antler and start pulling. 
<P>
A few hours later the fellow hunter passes by again and sees the two 
tired Polish hunters still at it, slowly but steadily pulling their 
moose by its horns through the woods. 
<P>
"How's it going?" he asks. 
<P>
"Great!" they reply.  "We only have one problem: we are getting farther 
and farther away from our car." 
<P>
