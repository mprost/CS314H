The two questions that I am asked most often are "does this look infected 
to you?" and "boy, I bet computer science takes up a lot of your time." 
In partial answer to both, I would like to submit the following, 
<P>
Saddam Hussein's Top Ten Hopes for the New Year 
<P>
<HR>
10. That the chef won't continue to serve ``date surprise'' every night 
of the week. 
<P>
9. in between brutally silencing his opponents he'll be able to find 
a little quite time for himself. 
<P>
8. be able to use the Video Toaster to make Iraqi TV footage of 
``Death to American Satan'' rallies look more like a Vanilla Ice 
video. 
<P>
7. no one realizes that Tariq Aziz used to play Larry Tate on 
``Bewitched''. 
<P>
6. there will finally be a college football playoff system. 
<P>
5. that people won't start wondering why they've never seen him 
and the official government spokesmen together. 
<P>
4. that Iraq will have a piece of Saudi Arabia--- oops that 
should be that Iraq will have *peace with* Saudi Arabia. 
<P>
3. the New York Post will stop using his first name as a verb. 
<P>
2. that Noriega's lawyer has received the retainer he sent. 
<P>

he promised the wife last year.
