Everything I need to know I learned on Kindergarten Recess.

"The teacher on duty was a real pain.  We learned to keep on eye on her.
We learned how to sneak off in the woods to play doctor, and if we were
caught it meant time in the principals office.  All the rules and
enforced naps ruined the morale of even the toughest kids.  I remember
this one kid, Robbie Folghum.  God, what a wimp fag little teacher's pet
he was.  At recess we used to take turns beating him up, including the
girls.."
