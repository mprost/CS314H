				Bedroom golf

	The player will furnish his own equipment for play, normally
	one club and two balls.

	Owner of the course must approve equipment before play may begin.

	Unlike regular golf, the object of the game is to get the club
	into the hole while keeping the balls out.

	For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft.
	The course owner may check the stiffness of the shaft before
	allowing play to commence.

	Course owner reserves the right to restrict the shaft length,
	so as to avoid damage to the course.

	The object of the game is to take as many strokes as possible,
	until the course owner is satisfied.

	Players are cautioned to play the correct hole, as indicated by
	the course owner.

	It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately
	upon arrival at the course.  Experienced players will admire the
	course, paying special attention to the well-formed bunkers.

	Players are cautioned not to mention other courses the have played
	recently to the owner of the course presently being played.

	If the course to be played is temporarily under repair, player is
	advised to find alternate means of play.

	It is considered outstanding form to play the hole several times
	in one match.

	Course owner shall be the judge of who is the best player.

	It is considered bad form to reveal your score to other players,
	or even that you have played the course.
