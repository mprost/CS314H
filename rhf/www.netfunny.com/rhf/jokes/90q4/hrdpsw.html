A fellow from the city was driving through the country one day when  he  came 
upon  a  quaint farmhouse alongside of the road - and there was even a farmer 
standing out front.  So the city boy decided to stop and talk to the farmer. 
<P>
"Good morning, sir," he said, "I was driving by, admiring the country, 'cause 
I'm a city boy,  and I couldn't help but notice that you have a field full of 
cows on your farm.  Now I've lived in the city all my  life  and  I've  never 
tried  any  fresh  country milk.  If it's all right with you, I'd like to try 
some fresh country milk from your cows." 
<P>
The farmer replied, "Son, those are bulls!  You don't get milk from bulls!!" 
<P>
And  the  city boy said, "But I won't hurt your cows.  All I want to do is to 
try some fresh country milk." 
<P>
The farmer had to try again, "Son, those are BULLS!!  You don't get milk from 
BULLS!!!" 
<P>
But the city boy persisted,  "Really, I won't hurt your COWS!  I just want to 
try some fresh country milk!!" 
<P>
So the farmer reluctantly gave in, "Son, knock yourself out." 
<P>
In  a  half  an hour the city boy returned from the fields carrying a pail of 
fresh country milk.  The farmer scratched his head and started to speak,  but 
the  city boy jumped in with, "You know, while I was out in the field getting 
this lovely fresh country milk, I saw  a  fence  covered  with  honeysuckles. 
And  you  know,  I've  been city boy all my life and I've never had any fresh 
country honey.  If it's all right with  you,  I'd  like  to  try  some  fresh 
country honey from your honeysuckles." 
<P>
And  the  farmer replied, "Son, honeysuckles are flowers.  You get honey from 
bees." 
<P>
But the city boy persisted, "I won't hurt your flowers.  I just want  to  try 
some fresh country honey." 
<P>
So the farmer tried again, "Son, honey comes from BEES!" 
<P>
But the city boy was adamant, "Really, I won't hurt your FLOWERS! I just want 
to try some fresh country honey!!" 
<P>
And the farmer reluctantly gave in again, "Son, be my guest." 
<P>
In a half an hour the city boy boy returned with 2 mason jars full of  honey. 
The  farmer scratched his head harder than before and started to speak.  Just 
then the city boy said, "You know, I'm a city boy - been a city  boy  all  my 
life.   Now  while  I  was  out  getting  some  of  that fresh country honey, 
I noticed that you have a field full of pussy willows ..." 
<P>
"Son," interrupted the farmer, "let me get my hat." 
<P>
