<PRE>These songs were written by some people here at uni
and they have given me permission to post them here.
They are to be sung to the tune of "My Favourite Things"
(I just <b>knew</b> that movie had to be good for something)

This was written by Fred Curtis (who is perfectly normal - really)

	Pointers to pointers to printf()-like functions;
	Unary minus and nested conjunctions;
	Integers, booleans, characters, strings;
	These are a few of my favourite things.

	Bach on a CD and good indentation;
	Not getting mugged while en route to the station;
	Fountains with wishes and Gnomes without slings;
	These are a few of my favourite things.

	When the bug bites! When core dumps!
	When the machine's had the &lt;proverbial&gt;
	I simply remember my favourite things
	And then I don't fell so sick.

In response to which came the following song:

WARNING: May be offensive - pretend that it's rot13'd

This was written by GRoo who is the most pious,
kindhearted and morally pure person I know :-)
The devil made him do it

	Fourteen inch dildos with straps of elastic
	Form fitting underwear made of clear plastic
	Five foot four women with haircuts like boys
	These are a few of my favourite toys.

	Warm sticky substances smeared on my belly
	Plastic containers filled with KY Jelly
	Women who can turn their tongues upside down
	These are a few of the best things I've found.

	When the whip cracks. When the straps snap.
	When I'm feeling glum.
	I think of the wonderful games that I've played.
	I let out a sigh and &lt;proverbial&gt;.

Isn't it amazing what people trying to avoid work can get up to?
