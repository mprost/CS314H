Dear Brad, 
With permission of the author, Terry Smith, I'm submitting his 
description of a practical joke that he and a friend played on 
another friend as a birthday gag. 
<P>
Terry is sastks@unx.sas.com. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The following account describes a practical joke played on a friend for 
his 40th birthday.  The submission comes from the narrator, Terry Smith. 
Paul is Terry's partner in crime, while Mark is the poor sot having the 
birthday.  This really happened. 
<P>
Minneapolis.  Saturday. 
<P>
11:00 AM - My friend Paul and I walk down the street in front of 
Mark's house. We are wearing surgical pants &amp; shirt, 
stethoscopes, weird translucent masks, and yellow plastic 
fedoras. I am carrying a boom box playing the theme from 
"The Good, the Bad, &amp; the Ugly." We are looking at a map 
as though lost in this quiet, suburban neighborhood, yet 
we do not ask Mark for directions. He is watching his baby 
play in the yard as we pass. He stares, says nothing. 
<P>
12:30 PM - Mark is sent to the grocery store. We are there, same 
costumes, same music. But this time, we have small hand 
mirrors. We flash signals at him from across the parking 
lot as he walks into the store.  He stares, does nothing. 
While he is in the store, we place a handwritten note 
under his windshield wiper. It says, "Today is your 
Day, Leviticus 9:14."  A woman drives past and tells 
us we look like gynecologists.  We disappear. 
<P>
2:00 PM - Mark, wife, and kid go to furniture store. Guess who shows 
up? Right, us. Since we want to move in closer now, we 
wrapped our faces completely in white gauze. We get very 
very close, invading his personal space as he tries to 
walk down the sidewalk with his family (his wife is in 
on the whole thing).  We do not talk - instead we make 
small noises that sound like TWEET TWEET.  We have tags 
on our shirts that say "Burn Victims." Paul holds an 
international picture communication book in Mark's face; 
he points at a picture of a man playing golf. Mark is 
very annoyed, but responds "So you want to play some 
golf?" We say TWEET TWEET and nod our bandaged heads. 
They all get in the car and drive away. Paul and I 
stand silently next to the car as they exit. 
"The Good, the Bad, &amp; the Ugly" stings the ears of 
innocent bystanders. 
<P>
3:30 PM - Mark's wife has made dinner reservations at a French 
restaurant. Paul &amp; I go there and speak with the manager 
and tell him our plan.  They buy the whole thing and 
agree to cooperate in full. 
<P>
7:00 PM - Mark and guests arrive dressed for a fancy dinner. 
As they are seated, they notice a boom box in the corner. 
It is playing the same weird music as earlier. Mark 
doesn't seem to notice.  He orders soup, gets it, and 
discovers a bloody band-aid floating in it. He calls 
the waiter (Rolf), and Rolf apologizes and goes to get 
the managers - us. On that note, we appear from the 
kitchen (where we've been having a little vino and 
watching through a porthole). We are wearing tuxedos, 
masks, yellow hats, and frantically saying TWEET TWEET 
TWEET! Finally, we show ourselves, Mark laughs like a 
raving maniac, we pull guns and kill the other guests, 
we give Rolf a big tip and call it a night. 
<P>
Yes it was one hell of a 40th birthday surprise. For his 50th 
we're talking about burning his house. 
<P>
