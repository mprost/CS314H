<PRE>This is the one-liner file annual, a collection of the various short jokes,
puns and one liners that didn't excite me enough to be given a posting of
their own, but yet are still worth reading.

Now an apology -- I let this file sit for quite some time, and when I
came to look at it today, the middle of it was garbage -- blocks from
other files.   Sadly it is this way on the backups, too.  So it is
far shorter than it should be.  If you submitted something, and got
a note that it would go in the oneliner file, and it isn't here (with your
name or somebody else's -- don't just grep for your name, I removed
duplicates) you can send it again with a note that it's for the oneliner file.

Subject: Oddball mathematical proof

[ From "On the Nature of Mathematical Proofs", Joel Cohen ]

Theorem: Every horse has an infinite number of legs

Horses have an even number of legs.  Behind they have two legs,
and in front they have fore legs.  This makes six legs, which is
certainly an odd number of legs for a horse.  The only number
that is both odd and even is infinity.  Therefore, horses have an
infinite number of legs.
