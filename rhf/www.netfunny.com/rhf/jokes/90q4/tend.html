<PRE>
      Sue and Bob, a pair of tightwads, lived in the midwest, and had
been married years.  Bob had always want to go flying.  The desire
deepened each time a barnstormer flew into town to offer rides.  Bob
would ask, and Sue would say, "No way, ten dollars is ten dollars."

      The years went by, and Bob figured he didn't have much longer, so
he got Sue out to the show, explaining, it's free to watch, let's at
least watch.  And once he got there the feeling become real strong.  Sue
and Bob started an argument.  The Pilot, between flights, overheard,
listened to their problem, and said, "I'll tell you what, I'll take you
up flying, and if you don't say a word the ride is on me, but if you
make one sound, you pay ten dollars."

      So off they flew.  The Pilot doing as many rolls and dives as he
could. Heading to the ground as fast as the plane could go, and pulling
out of the dive at just the very last second.  Not a word.  Finally he
admitted defeat and went back the airport.

      "I'm surprised, why didn't you say anything?"

      "Well I almost said something when Sue fell out, but ten dollars
is ten dollars."
