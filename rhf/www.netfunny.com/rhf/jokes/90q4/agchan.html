<PRE>After eight years in college, there is one Aggie student who still 
can't seem to get himself graduated.  He got in five years on a 
football scholarship, and everyone likes him, but he just can't seem 
to make it through his classes.    

The professors and the board of regents at the school are beginning to 
be anxious about the possible damage to the school's reputation, and 
decide that graduate or not, Jethro has got to go.  They are worried 
that the general public is going to hear about this student hasn't
graduated after eight years.  After conferring with each other, they 
give him the <a href="news:">news:</a>  "Jethro, we've decided that this is going to be 
your last semester at A&amp;M.  So we're going to give you a test at 
graduation time.  We're going to ask you just one question, and if you 
answer it correctly, you graduate.  If you answer it incorrectly, you 
don't graduate.  But either way, this is your last semester and it's
time to leave the school."  

So graduation rolls around, and Jethro is the very last person to step
up, because he still has to take the test.  Everyone at school knows
about it and each person in the audience holds his breath as the
university president asks Jethro the Test Question.  "Jethro, what's 
four plus three?"  Jethro thinks hard for a moment, and then hesitantly 
answers, "Seven?"  There is a brief moment of silence, and then another 
Aggie calls out from the audience:

"Aw, gee, give him another chance!"
