<PRE>
This is my own; I came up with it during a meeting about the
doctoral prelim exam in our department.  It collects some of
the complaints that faculty typically have about doctoral students,
and, in the true spirit of satire, exaggerates them.


		I Am the Very Model of an Aero Doct'ral Candidate


			with apologies to Gilbert and Sullivan,
			and to my own doctoral students, about
			whom I have no complaints whatsoever


	I am the very model of an aero doct'ral candidate;
	I took each course three times so that my GPA I could inflate.
	I waited seven terms before I signed up to matriculate,
	So when I took the prelims I'd forgotten how to integrate.

	I do research two nights a week,
	From 6 PM till almost 8.
	I haven't got results yet but I should before I graduate.
	Of troubles, worries, cares and woes,
	I'd have to say I've not a one;
	In fact grad school in Aerospace is really quite a lot of fun.

		In fact grad school in Aerospace is really quite a lot of fun.
		In fact grad school in Aerospace is really quite a lot of fun.
		In fact grad school in Aerospace is really quite a lot,
		a lot of fun.

	I do just enough work that my advisor I won't aggravate,
	For then he'd drop me and my funding he would reappropriate.
	In short I'm quite expensive for the department to educate;
	I am the very model of an aero doct'ral candidate.
