(I heard this joke from a English Catholic priest, living in Denmark.) 
<P>
Old Andrzej was a minister in a small Polish town. He had always been a 
good man and lived by the Bible. One day God decided to reward him, with the 
answer to any three questions Andrzej would like to ask. 
<P>
Old Andrzej did not need much time to consider, and the first question was: 
"Will there ever be married Catholic priests?" 
<P>
God promptly replied: "Not in your life-time." 
<P>
Andrzej thought for a while, and then came up with the second question: 
"what about female priests then, will we have that one day?" 
<P>
Again God had to disappoint Old Andrzej: "Not in your life-time, I'm afraid." 
<P>
Andrzej was sorry to hear that, and he decided to drop the subject. After 
having though for a while, he asked the last question: 
"Will there ever be another Polish pope?" 
<P>
God answered quickly and with a firm voice: "Not in my life-time." 
<P>
