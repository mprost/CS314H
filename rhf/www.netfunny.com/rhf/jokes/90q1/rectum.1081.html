Rectal foreign bodies: Case reports and a comprehensive review of 
the world's literature 
<P>
D.B. Busch, Ph.D., M.D., and J.R. Starling, M.D. 
<P>
in the journal Surgery, 1986. 
<P>
Abstract 
<P>
The surgical management of two patients presenting with 
incarcerated, apparently self-inserted foreign bodies is 
reported.  The large volume of prior literature on this subject is 
reviewed, with a tabluation of 182 previous cases by type and 
number of objects recovered and with a discussion of patients' 
age distribution, history, complications, and prognosis. 
Management problems addressed include history, differential 
diagnosis of reported pruitis ani, and handling of suspected 
assault. 
<P>
Case 1. 
<P>
A 39-year-old married white male lawyer presented with a 
self-inserted perfume bottle in his rectum that he was unable to 
remove using various objects, including a back scratcher.  He had 
inserted this bottle on previous occasions.  Edema of the rectum 
and sigmoid colon precluded the successful manual removal of the 
object in the emergency room. ... The 3 by 17 cm object, "Impulse 
Body Spray," was removed manually after a spinal anesthetic.
