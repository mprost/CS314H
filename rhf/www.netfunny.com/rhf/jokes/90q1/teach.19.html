Has anybody attempted a compilation of the hilarious things kids do 
and say in the process of growing up?  If not, I am willing to act as 
a collector of these stories.  Email me, and I'll repost as the list 
grows.  To start things off (or to add to someone else's list) I have 
the following two stories: 
<P>
Story #1: Told to me by a former co-worker. 
<P>
Eliot was about 3 when he and his dad paid a visit to a local mall. 
Eliot began to misbehave, so his dad picked him up and proceeded to 
carry him out of the store.  As they made their way to the exit, Eliot 
yelled out, "Hey mister, put me down." 
<P>
[You can guess what they taught Eliot in preschool.] 
<P>
Story #2: Told to me by a school principal at a panel discussion on 
"Is your child ready for kindergarten?" 
<P>
The principal was visiting the kindergarten class, as was his daily 
habit.  The teacher was teaching the children about colors.  She asked 
the class if anyone knew what color one got when one mixed blue and 
yellow.  One kid immediately yelled out, "Green!"  The teacher, 
shocked at the child's quick and correct answer, asked how he knew. 
The child replied, "My mommy puts this blue stuff into the potty, and 
when I do a pee pee it turns green." 
<P>
