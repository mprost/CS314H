Told to me by my mother, who owned a pharmacy in Tennessee, in 1950. 
<P>
A fellow with a bad cough comes in to the pharmacy, walks up to 
the counter and asks for the pharmacist. A young clerk tells him 
that the pharmacist is not available. The man asks the young 
clerk if he can recommend anything for his cough. 
<P>
The clerk gives him a bottle of some medicine for his cough. 
The customer takes a big swig, then after a few minutes, with 
no apparent relief, he takes another, and another. 
<P>
In a short while, the pharmacist returns, and sees his old friend, 
the customer with the cough, sitting quietly in a booth 
near the soda fountain. He says to his clerk that the fellow 
has never before stopped at the soda fountain. 
<P>
The clerk proudly tells the pharmacist the story of his transaction. 
The pharmacist looks at the recommended medication and angrily 
reprimands the clerk for recommending a laxative, instead of cough syrup. 
<P>
The clerk reminds the pharmacist the whatever the mode, the medication 
was effective. The pharmacist replies, "Now, he's afraid to cough!" 
<P>
