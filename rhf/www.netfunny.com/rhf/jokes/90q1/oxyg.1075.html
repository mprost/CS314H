Dear Mr. Templeton: 
<P>
Due to frustrations I have experienced in recent months, I am forced 
to turn to you for help.  For you see, I have made a remarkable 
discovery, that at present, I have had little luck in impressing 
upon a public made overly skeptical by wild and unsubstantiated 
claims made by crackpot media hounds posing as scientists.  These 
imposters have sullied the public mind to true and enlightened 
breakthroughs, and I have been unable to have my work taken seriously 
at any of the well-respected scientific journals.  I turn to you 
in desperation, and I know that my evidence will meet with unbiased, 
objective reason before your forum. 
<P>
I have discovered that a simple organic fabric, liberally soaked in an 
aqueous solution of di-hydrogen oxide, and then spun in a high 
temperature superconducting gyroscope, will experience a anomalous weight 
loss due, for the most part, to a cold fusion reaction. 
<P>
I describe my experimental procedure:  An ordinary, carefully sorted 
load of all cotton fabrics was soaked in a distilled solution of 
di-hydrogen oxide.  This load was carefully weighed and then put 
into the high temperature superconducting gyroscope. 
After a thirty minute exposure to a lateral 
spin, the load was removed and carefully weighed a second time.  In 
every case, the second measurement indicated an anomalous weight 
reduction. 
<P>
Due to the absence of the aqueous solution after the spin, 
I theorize that this weight reduction is caused by a cold fusion 
reaction between the two hydrogen atoms in the di-hydrogen oxide 
molecule to produce one helium and one oxygen molecule.  Since 
helium is lighter than air, perhaps this contributes to the weight 
reduction.  The fact that I was unable to detect a noticeable release 
of heat confirms that this is in fact <B>cold</B> fusion.  I expect that 
the organic nature of the cotton fabric in some way provides a 
catalyst for this reaction to take place.  With this in mind, 
I attempted to determine if live organic matter would increase 
the effect.  Unfortunately, the experiment was unconclusive as my 
cat, Fluffy, failed to remain in a live state over the duration of 
the experiment.  Four further experiments, using various rodents, 
achieved similar results, leading me to conclude that the anomalous 
weight loss effect is not a suitable diet technique for humans. 
<P>
I know that the gyroscope is superconducting since the metal casing is 
clearly marked "Amana Superconvection Dryer."  Now, as we all know, 
convection is nearly the same as conduction, so this is what they must 
really mean.  I know that it is a high-temperature superconductor because 
the temperature switch was set on "High" throughout the experiment. 
<P>
The ramifications of this discovery are enormous.  However, my every 
attempt to describe this important effect has fallen on deaf ears. 
Please help me spread the word about this earth-shattering breakthrough. 
<P>
