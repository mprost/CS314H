Picture if you will, a mountain high on  top of the world with a sharp 
cliff that provides an  excellent jump to your death.  There are three men 
standing by this cliff and remarking at what a long way down it is. 
<P>
Suddenly, a good fairy appears and says: 
"Good gentlemen I will give you one wish.  As you jump off this cliff, 
call out your wish, and I will grant you your wish and safe passage to 
ground level." 
<P>
So, the first man, who by the way was Italian, took a running start and 
jumped off the cliff. As he plumetted to almost certain human death, he 
called out, 
<P>
"An IROC CAMARO with big fuzzy dice hanging in the window and a 
gorgeous girl to go along." 
<P>
And just as the good fairy promised, he landed safely in between his new "car" 
and gorgeous blond girl, where he proceeded to run from one to the other, 
not knowing which one to kiss first. 
<P>
The second man, being an East Indian by the name of Raj, saw what happened 
to the Italian Stallion and ran off the cliff happily screaming with his 
distinctive accent: 
"Riches and fame." 
<P>
It was a short and simple request, but that was all the English he could 
handle while jumping off a cliff.  Well, low and behold as he reaches the 
bottom safely he is swarmed by dozens of adoring fans, while a limousine 
full of money arrives to pick him up. 
<P>
Well, the last fellow was a short, stout fellow from a faraway place in a 
most northern country called Canada.  This fellow is commonly referred to 
as a NEWFIE.  The Newfie was so impressed at how the other two gentlemen had 
prospered in life that he gave grave and careful thought to what he would 
say as he plumeted off the cliff at break neck speeds.  So, he began to 
run, and just as he neared the edge of the cliff he tripped on a stone and 
fell off the cliff, yelling with disgust: 
<P>
"Shit!!!" 
<P>
And thus, he safely landed. 
<P>
