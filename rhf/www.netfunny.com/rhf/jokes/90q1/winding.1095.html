-From: Brian Lees:DGC 
<P>
A  man is traveling through the desert when he comes upon an an Indian lying on 
the ground stark naked with a hard-on sticking straight up in the air. He  asks 
the  Indian  what  he  is  doing,  to which the Indian replies "I'm telling the 
time." The man tells the Indian that he doesn't believe it, so the Indian tells 
him that it is 1:00. The man looks at his watch and is amazed to find  that  it 
is exactly 1:00. 
<P>
He  travels  a bit longer until he comes upon another naked Indian lying on the 
ground with a hard-on sticking straight up. He asks  this  Indian  what  he  is 
doing  and  he  too replies that he is telling the time. He tells the Indian to 
prove it and the Indian tells him that it is 2:00. The man looks at  his  watch 
and once again is amazed that the time is correct. 
<P>
He  continues his trek through the desert until he comes across an Indian lying 
naked in the sand, masturbating. He asks this Indian "and what the hell are you 
doing?" 
<P>
To which the Indian replied: "I'm winding my watch!"
