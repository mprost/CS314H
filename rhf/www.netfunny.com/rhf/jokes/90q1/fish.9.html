CALL FOR DISCUSSION: 
<P>
Recently there has been some extremely high volume in the existing 
groups designated for the discussion of aquaria.  This high volume 
has prompted many users to suggest that new aquaria groups be formed. 
The following is the summary of the suggestions for the new groups. 
<P>
The discussion period will last for approximately six weeks.  Following 
the close of the discussion period and the mandatory cross-posting flame 
war with news.groups, talk.bizarre, and the existing aquaria groups, 
the voting will commence on 1 April 1990 and continue for a period of 
two weeks.  Two neutral parties have volunteered to collect the votes, 
they are ftp@wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and nuucp@uunet.uu.net. 
<P>
Please note that the discussion topic is NOT which of the following 
groups is to be created.  What is to be discussed is the exact charter 
of each group, and the specific name of the individual group. 
<P>
