Oracularities are the distilled wisdom and sagacity of the Usenet 
Oracle, as incarnated as its numerous e-mail participants (only you and 
the Oracle know who you are).  This collection is from the series of 
regular Oracularities postings to rec.humor.

</PRE> The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. 
Your question was: 
<P>
What sort of budget did the creator have to work with?? 
<P>
	 And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
Good question, and it just so happens that I have a copy of the original 
budget request and approval notices as well as addenda: 
<P>

<P>
Thank you and I await your reply.

<BR>-Date:     January 23, 4.5 billion B.C.<BR>
-From:     Office of Budgets and Financial Planning<BR>
-To:       The Creator<BR>
-Subject:  Budget Request #1A<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Your Budget for Creation has been approved in the amount of $4,632,000. 
We are cutting $75,000 off of the Human Intelligence line item and $1000 
off of Miscellaneous office supplies. 
<P>
This project is being funded for a period of 4 days. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<BR>-Date:     June 12, 4.5 billion B.C.<BR>
-From:     The Creator<BR>
-To:       Office of Budgets and Financial Planning<BR>
-Subject:  Budget Request #1A: Addendum<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Due to a labor shortage (one of my archangels has left and taken many 
other workers with him to work on a competing project) I respectfully 
request an extension of 2 days. 
<P>
In addition I have experienced difficulties with the contractor hired 
for the Human Development program and have had to send out bids for 
another Human Development contractor.  Therefore I am requesting an 
additional $95,000 for this project. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<BR>-Date:     December 3, 4.5 billion B.C.<BR>
-From:     Office of Budgets and Financial Planning<BR>
-To:       The Creator<BR>
-Subject:  Budget Request #1A: Addendum<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Project extension approved for 2 additional days.  However we are unable 
for fulfill your additional budget request of $95,000. 
<P>
<HR>
There's your answer.  Oh, it turned out that the Creator petitioned for 
a Bond insurance which helped him to raise most of the $95,000 he needed. 
<P>

 The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. 
Your question was: 
<P>
Tell me O Oracle most wise in the ways of Personkind... 
<P>
Do you get visual aids from eyeball sex? 
<P>
	And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
Yes.  Always remember to wear sunglasses when ogling broads on the 
beach. 
<P>
Also, you may get hearing aids from letting your SO lick the inside of 
your ears.  Whispering loving words into the ear of your partner is 
probably safe, at least if he/she/it wears ear plugs. 
<P>
You owe the Oracle a GIF picture of Annie Lennox in the nude. 
<P>
<HR>
 The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. 
Your question was: 
<P>
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck 
wood? 
<P>
	And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
Ok.  That's it.  This is the last time I'm putting up with this stupid 
question.  I mean, EVERYONE asks this when they can't think of an 
intelligent, well-formed question for me to answer.  I'm pissed. 
Really.  I need a vacation.  I think I'll go to the Bahamas.  Yeah, the 
Bahamas.  That's where all the oracles hang out for New Years.  I hear 
the INTERNET oracle's gonna be staying at the Hilton.  I'll book a room 
there. 
<P>
&lt;dial 1-809-4HILTON&gt; 
<P>
&lt;ring....  ring...  ring......  Hello, Bahamas Hilton, may I help you?&gt; 
<P>
Yes.  I'd like to book a room for New Year's week. 
<P>
&lt;May I have your name please?&gt; 
<P>
The USENET oracle. 
<P>
&lt;OH!!!  Mr Oracle!!!!!  I have a message for you here!  Let's see...... 
here we go....  "How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck 
could chuck wood?"&gt;

 The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. 
Your question was: 
<P>
How does my modem work? 
<P>
	And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
<BR>It has a little gnome inside<BR>
Who would leave if he weren't tied,<BR>
Who reads your Macintoshes' screen<BR>
Of every dot and every gleam,<BR>
And in his little gnomish voice<BR>
Calls up his girlfriend named Joyce<BR>
And tells her everything you said,<BR>
In hopes that she'll take him to bed.<BR>
But Joyce to him will not put out;<BR>
To fend him off she tries to shout<BR>
And glum, the modem-gnome transcribes<BR>
Those manifestly evil vibes<BR>
And writes each one upon your Mac.<BR>
And yes, it is a kludgy hack.<BR>
<P>
</PRE>You owe the oracle a screw, and half a plate of ratatouille. 
<P>
<HR>
 The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. 
Your question was: 
<P>
Could you give me a poem about Lithuanian onion farms? 
<P>
	And in response, thus spake the Oracle: 
<P>
<PRE><P>
 The rhythm and rhyme will be a bit cockeyed, as it is (of course) 
 translated from the Lithuanian. 
  
 Juris trudges to the field of onions 
   For to fetch Marta his love a sharp bouquet 
     of onions, the vegetable of love. 
 Marta, she will not see him, 
   For she has many tasks this day. 
     The life on the farm of onions is a work burden 
 Marta, she will not see him, 
   She kisses him and takes the bouquet, 
     And then she must go stuff leaves in the mouth of her sleeping 
     brother. 
 There are many chores on the farm of onions, 
   This is the way of life in sweet Lithuania 
     This is the joy of the farm of onions. 
<P>
