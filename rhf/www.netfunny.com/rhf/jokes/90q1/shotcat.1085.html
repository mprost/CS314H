<PRE>
        Mrs. Murphy was a woman who loved to make baked beans. Whenever she
made baked beans, she would always go to the church social and sell her baked
beans there. There was another woman, Mrs. Jones, who loved Mrs. Murphy's
baked beans, so she made it a point to be at the church social to buy Mrs.
Murphys' baked beans.

        One day, Mrs. Murphy baked some bake beans and put it on the window
sill to cool down, but outside were two boys outside playing with their BB gun
and a few pellets went into the pot of baked beans. But since Mrs. Murphy
didn't know about this, she didn't think anything of it and so went down
to the church social to sell her baked beans where Mrs. Jones was waiting
to buy Mrs. Murphys' baked beans that she loved so well.

        The next day Mrs. Jones calls up Mrs. Murphy and asked her if she had
changed her baked bean recipe. But Mrs. Murphy said that she hadn't changed
her recipe at all and that the procedures that she used were the same.
So Mrs. Murphy asked why, what the problem was. Mrs. Jones said that earlier
in the day when she bent down to feed the dog, she shot the cat.
