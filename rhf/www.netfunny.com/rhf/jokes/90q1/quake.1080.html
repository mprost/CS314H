This sounds like an urban myth, but I trust the teller. 
<P>
A friend from Berkeley just started working for the University.  His supervisor 
had the following tale to tell: 
<P>
The supervisor and his brother were going off to the 3rd game of the World 
Series on Oct. 17.  The brother was taking his new car, a pure white Mercedes 
with gold trim.  He'd bought it three days before. 
<P>
They get to the game, park, and go to the stands.  The earthquake hits. 
Everyone cheers.  Everyone goes out to their cars.  However, our two heroes 
can't find their car--it's been stolen.  Somehow they get home, tell the 
insurance company, and go on with their lives. 
<P>
A couple weeks ago, the insurance company phoned back saying that they'd found 
the car.  In fact, they'd found the thief as well--he was in the car when 
they found it... in the Cypress Structure, crushed to six inches high... 
<P>
The brother was horrified, but Andy's supervisor was really happy. 
"Yes, there is justice in this world!" 
<P>
