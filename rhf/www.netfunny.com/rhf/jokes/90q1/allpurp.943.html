<P>
These three strings go into a bar and order a martini.  One string 
notices a horse with a sign that says, "Make me laugh, make me cry, win 
$1000" on it.  Meanwhile, a bell starts ringing in the clock tower overhead, 
and suddenly there is a loud thud as a body falls to the street in 
front of the bar.  "I'm a Frayed Knot!" screams one enraged string at 
the bartender, and then disappears.  Kant leaves via the back door.  The 
other string stands in front of the horse and pulls down his pants.  It 
isn't clear at this point why the horse is wearing pants. 
<P>
The Inspector walks in the front door and says to no one in particular, 
"I can't remember his name, but his face rings a bell."  Several dozen 
customers instinctively stab their F keys.  The remaining string gulps 
down the rest of his martini and says, "And at these prices, you're not 
likely to see many more!" 
<P>
At the table in the back, the Doctor looks intently at his patient and 
says, "And if you don't quit jerking off, your elbow's never going to get 
any better!"  "You think your thore," the patient screams back, "I can't 
even thit!" 
<P>
There's a loud thud as another body hits the pavement in front of the 
bar, and a Purdue freshman runs in the door and says, "And now his brother's 
a dead ringer, too!" 
<P>
The door to the bathroom opens and a young boy in a vaguely Medieval 
costume wanders out.  "Do you know where some Yellow Fingers are?"  he 
asks. 
<P>
Suddenly, there is a loud crash outside and a bleeding man comes stumbling 
into the bar. "Was that a penguin I just ran over, or a nun with 
sunglasses?" he asks. "I think not," says the bartender, and disappears. 
<P>
A yokel gets up from a corner booth and asks the bartender (who has 
mysteriously reappeared), "Bartender, where is the library at?" The 
bartender looks askance at the hick and replies "We don't serve people 
from Purdue, *ASSHOLE*!" and hits him over the head with a bat, killing 
him instantly. 
<P>
Immediately, several people scream out "I'm a dead ringer for my 
brother!" 
<P>
(Fortunately, at this point the election results came in and Ferdinand 
Marcos won 512 to 2.) 
<P>
An Indian walks into the bar and asks the bartender for a Q-tip. "Wax 
problem?" the solicitous bartender asks. "No, buffalo come," replies 
the red man. 
<P>
The bartender notices a man scrawling graffiti on the wall and levels 
him with both barrels of a sawed-off shotgun.  The first part of the 
grafitti reads: 
<P>
<!--  in 0.4in-->
<blockquote>&gt;&gt;&gt;Electricians do it for the halibut. 
<P>
&gt;&gt;I have a haddock. 
<P>
&gt;Cod, I hate this. 
</blockquote>
<P>
The bar explodes into spontaneous applause. 
<P>
A prison convict stands on his chair, clears his throat and says, "57!" 
The room is dead silent.  The silence is broken by screams from the man 
trying to remove his appendix with the scalpel he found underneath his 
chair.  There are several examples of Universes scattered about the 
floor beside him. 
<P>
A disgruntled reader gets up and leaves via the front door...
