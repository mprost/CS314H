Jerry298@austin.relay.ucm.org swears this really happened to him... 
<P>
OK.  Here goes.  I was 17, and had mentioned to my father that I was thinking 
of buying a rubber boat for use as a scuba platform.  My father managed to 
get me one from the F.A.A. where he worked. (Don't ask, I never did). 
<P>
What he brought me was one of those Air Force survival rafts that they issue 
to bomber crews with up to 10 men. I couldn't wait to test it, so I called 
Jason, and told him to come on over. I took the back seat out of my VW bug, 
and laid the seat back down. This makes a VW bug kind of like a hatch back 
without the hatch. Jason got over to my place, just as our girlfriends showed 
up. They had come over to see if we wanted to go swimming. I crammed the 
raft, and both girls in the back of the VW (it was really tight), and Jason 
in the passenger seat up front, and took off. 
<P>
I got onto IH35 in Oklahoma 
City to head for one of the area lakes. The windows were down and the hot 
August wind was roaring through the car like a minor hurricane. My girlfriend 
started complaining about the wind, and a little red tag that kept getting 
tangled in her hair. I told her not to mess with the tag, but she got mad and 
gave it a good hard yank, intending to throw it out the window. 
<P>
Can you guess 
what that little red tag was for? Yep, that damned raft started to inflate 
right there in the VW!  It takes about 15 seconds for one of those things to 
inflate,  and for the first 5 seconds or so I was frozen with something of a 
mixture fear, amazement, and a sense of ``this really can't be happening!'' 
In the 6th second the raft started pushing my head down against the steering 
wheel hard enough that I couldn't really see where I was going, and started 
pushing the windows that weren't down out of their frames, and onto the road. 
By the time I got my wits back, the raft was fully inflated. 
<P>
I managed to push my head up enough to see where I was going, and hopefully 
avoid creaming anyone else on the road.  By this time the real chaos had 
started. The girls were screaming their fool heads off, Jason was laughing 
like an idiot, and the Oklahoma Highway Patrolman that had been following me 
when all this started had turned on his siren. 
<P>
I finally got the car to the 
center median, and stopped. I got hold of the door handle to open the door 
and pulled. The door shot open, and the raft exploded out of the car pushing 
me ahead of it. When I got to my feet, the first thing I saw was the OHP cop 
laughing so hard he had tears running down his cheeks, and having a hard time 
breathing. 
<P>
I managed to get the deflate mechanism activated and the raft 
started to deflate. By this time the cop was breathing again and somewhat 
coherent. He came over and told me that was the funniest thing he had ever 
seen. I asked if I was going to get a ticket? He said no, he just wanted to 
make sure no one got hurt. We folded the raft as best we could and went back 
to my place. The real fun was trying to convince my insurance company that 
all that glass damage really was because a life raft had inflated inside the 
car. They did payoff, but only after the insurance adjuster had talked to the 
OHP cop.  I can look back on this now and laugh. But for about 5 years after 
that happened, anytime someone (Jason usually) mentioned it, all I could do 
was turn red in the face. 
<P>
