This is an original composition in response to a debate on affirmative 
action in can.politics. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Jan 20, 1989 Edmonton. 
<P>
In a morning press conference, Minister of Justice Ed Dirk announced 
that his ministry will be adopting an affirmative action program. 
"Men have traditionally constituted the vast majority of inmates in 
Canadian prisons," he explained, "and we can not find any conclusive 
genetic or hormonal basis for this." In attempt to correct the imbalance, 
the corrections department will be implementing the following programs: 
<P>
 o   Early release of some male prisoners. 
<P>
 o   A compulsory course for all judges detailing a sentencing policy 
that will yield a more gender-balanced prison population. 
<P>
 o   An "equality based arrest policy" that basically consists of 
arbitrarily arresting women. 
<P>
It is this third provision which has raised the most controversy. 
Tracey Smith, spokesperson for the Constructive Sexism Action Committee 
said: 
<P>
"Sexism, like all things, should be done in moderation. We can 
accept that, given equal crimes, a woman should be given a stiffer 
sentence than a man. Arresting women without cause, however, is taking 
things too far." 
<P>
The Council of Men was more supportive of the proposal. "If equal and 
fair treatment doesn't give balanced representation of all groups, then 
clearly other actions must be taken," said spokesman John Loman, "We applaud 
the minister for having the backbone to tackle this longstanding injustice."
