This is original, but the style is borrowed from Anne Degeneres, 
a comedienne who currently has an HBO special out. 
<P>
I met this beautiful girl last night. She invited me back to her place and 
we had the <B>greatest</B> steamiest sex ever. Actually, it wasn't really the 
*greatest* sex ever, it was more like medium-great sex, and well, she didn't 
exactly invite me back to her place, I sort of followed her home to her 
apartment. 
<P>
To be factual, we didn't actually <B>have</B> sex per se, but we came very close. 
You see we were fondling each other pretty intensely...well, actually, I was 
fondling her, she wasn't fondling me...well, really, I wasn't actually 
*fondling* her, our bodies just got very close together.  To be honest, I 
just sort of brushed into her. 
<P>
Accidentally. 
But it was great, really hot and sensual you know? 
<P>
Actually, to be specific, it wasn't really <B>her</B> that I brushed into, it was 
actually the back of the chair she was sitting in. Although, the chair 
was...on the other side of a wall you see...in another room sort of. And I 
was sort of leaning  on the wall, but the chair was very close to the wall, 
very close.  Of course, she <B>was</B> on the third floor and I was sort of...on 
the street...leaning against the building. But wow!  What a night.  What a 
night. 
<P>
