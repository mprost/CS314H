<P>
</PRE>Dear Sirs, 
<P>
You'll remember us from the former competition we used to offer you in the 
networking market. Said competition having disappeared because of changing 
marketplace realities, we were wondering if any of you might be 
interesting in creating a synergistic partnership of equals based on an 
integrated solutions platform of services.... 
<P>
Aw, heck, let's cut to the chase. It's not looking good over here. Does 
anyone want to buy us? 
AT&amp;T, we know about the spin-off and all, but there's still time to 
reconsider at substantially the same price. 
<P>
Please reply with serious offers--not to say that they have to exceed 
our share price, but you have to mean it. 
<P>
<BR>Thank you,<BR>

&gt;From: Pepe Le Chance, Corporate Liaison, Alcatel<BR>
&gt;To: Bill Spilingup<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Cher Colleague, 
<P>
It is with the interest that I read your email. While we are having the 
difficulties also, we have not--how do you Americans say?--screwed up 
as badly as have you. The ease with which you have parleyed a $230 billion 
company into a $28 billion farce is formidable. On the other hand, we've 
taken Alcatel from a bloated behemoth involved in a ludicrously wide range 
of industries to a focused, disciplined company whose shares have risen 
80% since January 1, 1999. Our CEO is très fond of fixing broken 
companies. 
<P>
Donc, we are able at this time to make an offer for your company, under 
the right conditions. The main one, naturellement, is that we not pay any 
more for Lucent than any but the very oldest shareholders paid. Actuelly, 
we find the current share price to be like mousse chocolat at an imitation 
French restaurant--too rich for the discerning palate. We would propose 
a price slightly lower, in the region of $7 per share, and complete 
abolition of your management and board. 
<P>
Respondez, s'il vous plait, at your earliest convenience. 
<P>
<BR>Vôtre,<BR>
Pepe<BR>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
&gt;From: Bill<BR>
&gt;To: Pepe<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Dear Pepe, 
<P>
Thank you, thank you, thank you for your warm, encouraging letter. We at 
Lucent would love the opportunity to work with your fine organization. 
First, we think that the potential business synergies are substantial. 
Second, we relish the thought of engaging in negotiations while dining on 
frogs' legs and brioche. Our CEO is a Francophile from way back. 
<P>
The price you quote is perfectly acceptable to the board. We've repriced 
all our options below the stated level, so there's no problem there. As to 
the other so-called "shareholders" of the company, well, most of them are 
old grannies, who got the stock as a spin-off from AT&amp;T. They've never had 
a clue. 
<P>
With regard to the board and management, however, we had a different 
proposal in mind. Like in any separation, as I'm sure you in France agree, 
it's important that all parties be able to maintain the lifestyle to which 
they have become accustomed. In that spirit, we expect all members of our 
board be transferred to Alcatel's board. You'll be happy to know that 
we've already chosen a beautiful chalet in the French Alps, where the 
board can meet during ski season. In the spirit of égalité, we'll leave 
the summer retreat to your discretion. 
<P>
Also, Lucent's upper management will need accommodation in the joint 
business. We feel that we've earned top positions at Alcatel, considering 
the outstanding work we've done creating value for Lucent's insiders. In 
addition, since we're American and you're French, and therefore nobody 
likes you, we will add much needed credibility to your company. I look 
forward to receiving a detailed executive compensation package. 
<P>
So that you might not object to our requests for managerial and board 
compensation, we'll reduce the share price of the transaction to $6.90. On 
this point, as you see, we are perfectly open to negotiation. 
<P>
Paris in the springtime, here we come! 
<P>

<HR>
<P>
&gt;From: Pepe<BR>
&gt;To: Bill<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Monsieur, 
<P>
We find your counter-offer of $6.90 most pleasing. With regards to your 
management team, however, we think that you have misunderstood our 
intentions. We feel, as does any objective observer of the situation, that 
your current management and board are the ones responsible for the debacle 
at Lucent. 
<P>
You managed to lose $3.7 billion in the first quarter of this calendar 
year. We, on the other hand, made 210 million Euros in genuine profit. You 
are infamous for handing out loans like a drunken sailor to any cheap 
little telco that comes begging. To let you retain positions of influence 
at Alcatel would be as foolish as allowing a megalomaniac to rise to power 
in the wake of a revolution. We will not make that mistake a second time. 
<P>
You are in huge trouble, mon ami. I do not think even you have confidence 
that you can work it out. You could take our proposal for the sake of your 
shareholders, or you could selfishly sink this deal over concerns about 
your own jobs. The choice is yours. 
<P>
<BR>Bon Chance,<BR>

&gt;From: Bill<BR>
&gt;To: Pepe<BR>
<P>
</PRE>It's true that our market cap has fallen faster than you people surrender 
to Germany every generation or so, but that doesn't mean you have to get 
snippy and actually hold us responsible! Let's talk about this reasonably. 
We could throw a few people overboard, sure, but the real fault for our 
problems lies with the line workers and other employees, most of which we 
can lay off! So, help out a brother here. We're willing to split the board 
half and half, and jettison maybe 10% of our execs. 
<P>

&gt;From: Pepe<BR>
&gt;To: Bill<BR>
<P>
<BR>I cannot help you. It seems that you and your shareholders must go down<BR>
together. Perhaps that is as it should be.<BR>
