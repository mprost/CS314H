</PRE>[As was inevitable, I was inundated with WTC quickies.  For obvious 
reasons, these jokes are far more offensive than any topical digest I've 
ever dealt with, and I really didn't want to post them at all, much less 
read them and decide which ones were "funny."  But RHF has a long-standing 
policy regarding offensive material, and principles aren't principles if 
one only adheres to them when convenient.  Let me make it clear that 
THESE JOKES ARE NASTY, SICK, AND HIGHLY OFFENSIVE.  IF YOU EVEN THINK THAT 
YOU MIGHT BE DISTURBED BY SUCH MATERIAL, DO NOT DECODE THIS ARTICLE.  And 
if you decide to risk it, please don't complain to me later, because I 
warned you.  Twice.  And encoded it.  - Jim] 
<P>
All tragedies inspire jokes, of both the regular and sick type, and the 
Sept 11 terrorist attacks are no different.   In many cases the jokes 
provide release from the horror, for many they provide nothing but offense. 
To understand why, one has to understand a bit about the nature of comedy. 
Most comedy derives from the combination of presenting something we find 
frightening or embarassing in a context where we are safe, combined with a 
cleverness of presentation.   Cleverness without the fear is mostly the 
province of puns. 
<P>
The first comedy can be seen in the laughter of small children hung in the 
air or twirled by their parents--scary, but safe. 
<P>
In some cases, if a subject or tragedy touches you deeply, it's not 
possible for your mind to find the safe context necessary to see it as 
humour.  The result is nothing but the original fear, or horror, and a 
bewilderment that anybody saw comedy, because for you there is none.  This 
is no less true for the RHF moderators, who must read through a myriad of 
jokes whenever any disaster strikes and decide which are "good" jokes. 
Note that the first WTC jokes appeared in the RHF queue on the evening 
of the 11th.  Even with the horror, people often find comedy even in the 
face of personal tragedy, the realization that something is not serious 
providing a relief. 
<P>
We've always published these jokes about tragedy, with warning.  We're not 
out to offend people who can't yet feel safe again.  Knowing some will 
ignore the warning, we seriously ask you to not decode these rot13 items 
unless you are confident that you are ready to release the emotion. 
Those who do will no doubt want to flame us, with a letter beginning, 
"I support your past posting of offensive jokes but this time you went 
too far/don't you realize the special tragedy/I'm for free speech, but..." 
The archives include jokes about a war that killed hundreds of thousands 
of Iraqis; it would be hypocritical to blanch because this time Americans 
are the victims.
