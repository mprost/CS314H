</PRE>Frank and Maybelle, an old couple who owned a small business, were 
sitting together on an airplane flying on their first vacation to 
Europe. Halfway through their trip the Captain announces: "Ladies and 
Gentlemen, I am afraid I have some terrible news. We're experiencing 
engine trouble and this plane will be forced to land immediately! 
Luckily, I see an island below us that should be able to accommodate our 
landing." A few minutes later the plane lands safely on the island and 
everyone deplanes and begin the task of figuring out what to do next. 
After a while old Frank turns to his wife and say's "This Island appears 
to be uncharted and desolate. In fact the Captain is unable to find it 
on any of his maps. So the odds are that we will never be rescued and 
will have to live on the island for a very long time, if not for the 
rest of our lives! This is horrible, simply horrible!" 
<P>
After a few minutes his wife Maybelle asks, "Did we pay our quarterly 
Federal income tax yet?" 
<P>
"No. What a silly thing to ask now!" says Frank. 
<P>
She replies, "Did you remember to mail off our State taxes before we 
left?" 
<P>
"No, I forgot to send the check, so what! Let 'em rot!" 
<P>
"One last thing," says Maybelle, "Did you remember to send property tax 
check this month?" 
<P>
"Nope, I'm afraid that I forgot that one too! And your point is?" 
<P>
Maybelle begins to grin, "So what are you smiling about!?" an 
exasperated Frank asks. 
<P>
"They'll find us!!" says Maybelle.
