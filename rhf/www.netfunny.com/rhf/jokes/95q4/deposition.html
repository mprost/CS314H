My wife received a copy of the following at her law firm.  It purports to be 
true.  For those of you who don't know, a "deposition" is a transcript of 
pre-trial testimony.  These transcripts tend to be thick documents. 
<P>
<BR>To:       all attorneys<BR>
Subject:  Depositions and Their Use<BR>
<P>
</PRE><P>
A friend sent me the following portion of a transcript, which was confirmed 
with one of the counsel involved (Ms. Olschner) and subsequently posted on 
Lexis Counsel Connect.  The transcript is from Birmingham, Alabama, although 
the use of a deposition of a party opponent "for any purpose" is also in the 
federal rules.  We have no word on what had happened immediately prior to this 
exchange: 
<P>
<B>The Court:</B>  Next witness. 
<P>
<B>Ms. Olschner:</B>  Your Honor, at this time I would like to swat Mr. Buck in the 
head with his client's deposition. 
<P>
<B>The Court:</B>  You mean read it? 
<P>
<B>Ms. Olschner:</B> No, sir. I mean to swat him [in] the head with it.  Pursuant to 
Rule 32, I may use the deposition "for any purpose" and that is the purpose 
for which I want to use it. 
<P>
<B>The Court:</B>  Well, it does say that. 
<P>
(Pause.) 
<P>
<B>The Court:</B> There being no objection, you may proceed. 
<P>
<B>Ms. Olschner:</B>  Thank you, Judge Hanes. 
<P>
(Whereupon Ms. Olschner swatted Mr. Buck in the head with a deposition.) 
<P>
<B>Mr. Buck:</B>  But Judge... 
<P>
<B>The Court:</B>  Next witness. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Buck:</B>  We object. 
<P>
<B>The Court:</B>  Sustained. Next witness. 
<P>
End transcript. 
<P>
