Background: In January 1995, two of our friends, Darren and Kona, eloped 
while overseas (in San Fransisco actually). As part of a farewell for 
them prior to them going to Cambridge to further their acedemic careers 
the following ceremony was held. It is original.

Mutual Friendship Ceremony [*]<BR>
Tim MacKenzie &amp; Robert Sewell<BR>
27 August, 1995<BR>
</center>
<P>
* This ceremony is a parody based on the Reformed Church's 1959 Form [1] 
for the solemnization of marriage. 
<P>
Daz and Kona have just signified their desire to be united in mutual 
friendship in this restaurant right now. <B>Since</B> there are no lawful 
objections, the ceremony will begin. 
<P>
Beloved in the Lord, we are assembled here in the presence of all of 
us and a few resaurant staff for the purpose of joining in mutual 
friendship Katriona Elizabeth MacPhee and Darren Mark Platt, who, 
although married in the eyes of the state, did skillfully avoid our 
presence at the ceremony by doing so in a far away land without our 
certain knowledge. Since we have received no lawful objections to their 
proposed union, let us reverently call to mind the institution, purpose, 
and obligations of this state. 
<P>
The holy bond of friendship was institued by Bjarne Stroustrup himself 
at the very dawn of history, yea, even close to 1970. Making C++ in the 
likeness of C, he endowed it with many blessings and gave it dominion 
over all things, for it was Turing complete and had the Object Oriented 
nature. Moreover, Bjarne could have said: "It is not good that a class 
should be alone; I will make a help meet for it." Thereupon he created 
friend declarations to allow classes to provide other classes and 
functions access to their private and protected members. "Therefore 
shall a class leave its base classes, and shall cleave unto its friend; 
and they shall be as one class." 
<P>
Our Lord ANSI honored friendship by their blessed inscriptions of 
the laws of granting and receiving friendship, and confirmed it as a 
divine ordinance, as an honourable estate, and a lasting bond when they 
declared: "What Bjarne has brought together let no man put asunder." The 
apostle Damian shows its exalted nature when he uses friendship to form 
Connectable classes in his epistle to the young believers at Clayton. 
This can be read in the mystic chronicles of "Advanced Idiocy in C++," 
[3] chapter 8, verses 5-6. 
<P>
The purpose of friendship is the propogation of a class's members, the 
furtherance of the kingdom of C++, and the enrichment of the lives of 
those entering this state. This purpose calls for loving devotion to 
each other, and provision of appropriate protected member access to any 
classes multiply derived from them. 
<P>
For the home which friendship establishes, reality ordains that the 
woman should be the head of the husband, but that he should protect her 
and provide for her in love, a love which will be conducive to mutual 
happiness. Reality also ordains that the husband should be subject to 
the wife in all things and in all places and at all times. Thus the 
liberty of both husband and wife is glorified by mutual loyalty, and a 
home so begun becomes the very foundation of our society. 
<P>
We read now from "The annotated C++ reference manual," [2] colloquially 
known as the "ARM." I now ask Rob to come forward and read from The ARM, 
chapter 11, section 4. 
<P>
<PRE>      Friendship, like all other access, is granted by the class - not 
      unilaterally grabbed by the friend. 
<P>
      The friend mechanism is important. It allows a function to be 
      a friend of two classes. This can lead to increased efficiency 
      by letting a friend function bypass unsuitable access functions 
      provided to general users. Alternatively, the use of friends 
      can lead to cleaner interfaces by avoiding complicating the 
      interfaces of both classes with member functions specifically 
      designed to serve what would otherwise have been a global 
      function with no special access to the representation of the 
      classes. 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
Friendship, then, is a divine ordinance intended to be a source of 
happiness to a class, a construct of the highest significance to the 
programmer, and a symbol of the union of hardware and software. We may, 
therefore, as computer scientists, look with confidence for grace in the 
discharge of our mutual responsibilites and for guidance and help in our 
common perplexities and trials. 
<P>
In order to be equitable, we must have mutual friendship. For to be 
otherwise would be an abomination and likely to result in criminal 
proceedings. I now ask Linda to continue our readings from the ARM, 
Chapter 11, section 4. 
<P>
<PRE>     The only way of specifying mutual friendship between two 
     classes is to declare all of the second class a friend of 
     the first. 
<P>
     Friendship is neither inherited nor transitive. 
<P>
     The rule against inheriting friendship is sometimes not 
     appreciated; that is, it occasionally gets in the way of a 
     user. Consider, however, the effect of allowing friendship 
     to be inherited. That would make it possible for a user to 
     grab access. 
<P>
     The mechanism for allowing a user to grab access (to an 
     explicitly defined interface) is protected members. 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
We see therefore that mutual friendship requires complete access to be 
provided to the friend class. For balance, we require each class to take 
all of the other as a friend. 
<P>
And now, Kona and Darren, having heard from the word of Stroustrup the 
teaching concerning mutual friendship, do you assent thereto, and do you 
desire to enter in to this holy estate? 
<P>
Darren and Kona: We do. 
<P>
Who gives this woman to this man? 
<P>
Kona: I do. 
<P>
Who gives this man to this woman? 
<P>
Kona interjects: I do! 
Darren (after prompting): She does. 
<P>
[Join right hands] 
<P>
May those present confirm the desire and purpose of your hearts, and 
witness your beginning in the name of Stroustrup. 
<P>
Kona, do you solemnly declare that you take to yourself and acknowledge 
as a friend Darren, here present, and do you promise that you will, with 
the gracious help of the chief programmer, love, honor, and maintain 
him, live with him in the holy bonds of friendship according to Bjarne's 
ordinance, maintain friendship and consistency in times of low memory 
and disk space, and never reduce his access, until either of your 
destructors are called. 
<P>
Kona: I will. 
<P>
Darren, do you solemnly declare that you take to yourself and 
acknowledge as a friend Kona, here present, and do you promise that 
you will, with the gracious help of the chief programmer, love, honor, 
and obey her in all things lawful, live with her in the holy bonds 
of friendship according to Bjarne's ordinance, maintain friendship and 
consistency in times of low memory and disk space, and never reduce her 
access, until either of your destructors are called. 
<P>
Darren: I will. 
<P>
According to the laws of ANSI and the ordinances of Bjarne, I now 
pronounce you, Kona and Darren, friend and friend, in the name of the 
chief programmer and of the sysadmin and of the information superhighway 
(<B>spit</B>). What therefore the linker bindeth together let no operating 
system put asunder. Henceforth, as you go down your execution path 
together, may that path be free of segmentation and other violations, 
and may you be bound together in true love and faithfulness. 
<P>
Kona, you may now kiss the groom. 
<P>
[The signing of the Mututal Friendship declaration (below) was 
accompanied by an improptu solo performance of "Stand by your non gender 
specific partner."]
