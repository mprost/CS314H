<PRE>
An employee came into my office today carrying a folder full of papers. 
He told me that he was making an application to the State Police for a 
permit to carry a handgun.  He asked me for a letter from our company 
stating that we knew that he would be armed and that it was OK with us.
This would be included in the application packet.

I explained that, on the advice of our legal counsel, we would not be
able to provide him with any letter which mentioned the word "gun" for
fear of possible liability in case he happened to shoot the wrong person,
you know, someone like the police chief's daughter.

I told him that we would be able to provide him with a general letter 
addressed "To Whom It May Concern" stating that he worked here and that
he was a good employee.

ME:  You can use this letter as a character reference.

HIM:  But, I don't need another character reference!  I already have the
      best character reference in the world.

ME:  Really?

HIM:  Yes.  (Pulling a paper out of his stack of documents)  I have a 
      pardon from the GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY!


Oh yeah, right, let's be sure to give HIM a gun.
