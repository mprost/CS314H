<PRE>[Note - what follows is another issue of the One-Liner Digest.  These jokes
	are typically short jokes which weren't funny enough to warrant posting
	them as separate articles (with apologies to the authors).  They vary
	widely in subject matter, and the Digest therefore may very well offend
	just about everyone at one point or another.  The One-Liner Digest
	appears a few times every year - ed]

My wife Lise and I were waiting in line at the local OmniMax theatre,
and we saw a half a dozen young children misbehaving in line, with
only a single adult accompanying them.  My wife said, "That's the
problem with minivans, they allow parents to transport more kids than
they can control."

I was camping with some friends recently and we got to talking about
the "family values" craze now current in US politics.

Somebody asked, "Why do you suppose they call them 'nuclear'
families?"

I replied, "Because they give off a lot of energy when they split."

  For a change I decided to grab a different cereal last time I went
shopping.  Imagine my surprise when I find a Spree instant foncard glued to

  The biggest surprise was that America OnLine hadn't thought of it first.

These words of advice have adorned the wall next to my desk
since I finished my last graduate course in "artificial
intelligence."  I was prompted to share them by the recent
parody on People for Ethical Treatment of Software (PETS).

	Don't anthropomorphize computers.
	It wastes your time and annoys the computer.

Subject: Reasons for Israeli Military Successes 1967-73

The major contribution to the Israeli Military successes in
the wars of 1967-73 was not any great superiority of Israel's
Defense Forces, or military inferiority of the Egyptian army,
but rather the too strict adherence of Egyptian commanders to
their Soviet advisors' strategy.

Dig in and wait for winter.
