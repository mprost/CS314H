<PRE>    A story from my Anthropology prof, Mr. Garber, that he told in his
    Magic, Ritual, and Religion class (it managed to draw applause, go
    figure):

    My wife had gotten pregnant, and we were sitting in one of those
    birthing classes to learn all about "natural child birth" and how to
    breath.

    Well, on the first day we had to go around and introduce ourselves. 
    After that, the person in charge said:

    "We are all adults here, and we all know about sex, but it is amazing
    how little most adults know about the human body.  So, we are going to
    start on the female body at the navel and work our way around to the
    anus and name all of the parts"

    Everything was going good until the class was asked to name the piece
    of skin between the vagina and the anus.  No one knew the answer.

    Being a smart ass, I raised my hand.  The lady asked, "Mr. Garber, do
    you know the scientific name of the piece of skin between the vagina
    and the anus"

    "Yes"

    "And what is it?"

    "The chin rest"
