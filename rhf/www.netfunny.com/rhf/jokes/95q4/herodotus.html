<PRE>The following is is original:


This is an answer to the age-old question, "Why did the chicken cross the
road?" in the style of Herodotus (Greek historian, fifth century BC, called
the Father of History, but also the Father of Lies):

&gt;
&gt;        Another story that is told among the Cimmerians is this, that in
&gt;past times Chickens, and in particular that one Chicken, who was called
&gt;Misgetomenos the son of Aidoion, were wont to cross the Road. I myself,
&gt;however, having seen with my own eyes the Road of the Cimmerians, am
&gt;convinced that the Road is not, and never was, crossable by Chickens, nor
&gt;yet by Misgetomenos.
&gt;
&gt;        The Road is in appearance wondrous, and unlike any other thing in
&gt;the world. It is a straight, flat band, made of a material that the
&gt;Cimmerians call "asphalt" (which in the Cimmerian language means,
&gt;"asphalt.") It is possessed of two yellow lines, being both in the center
&gt;of the band, such that the center itself is between the yellow lines, and
&gt;is black. As it is wide, dirty, and not seemly in the matter of U-turns, I
&gt;am of the opinion that no Chicken ever crossed it.
&gt;
&gt;        There are three stories which are told about Misgetomenos the son
&gt;of Aidoion, of which the following is in my opinion the most probable, the
&gt;others being, so it would seem, completely untrue. This is that
&gt;Misgetomenos was not a Chicken at all, but rather a slave who, charged with
&gt;the painting of crosswalks, was called by the name of "Tsicken," which, in
&gt;the Greek language, means "chicken.
&gt;
&gt;        There is, however, a different tale which is told of the son of
&gt;Aidoion, and this I heard from the Greeks who live in Asia. This I will
&gt;recount, though I do not believe it. This is that Misgetomenos was, in
&gt;fact, a Chicken; further, that he did cross the Road of the Cimmerians,
&gt;simply for this reason: that he might get to the Other Side.

[Note - what can I say?  I had to read Herodotus too - ed.]
