</PRE>The out-of-state couple are camping on the shores of a lake  near 
a tiny hamlet. The young wife, stunningly built, decides to  give 
the local town folk a thrill by sun bathing in the nude. 
<P>
"That's  OK with me, honey," says her husband. "I'll go get  some 
wood for the fire." 
<P>
About  thirty minutes later, the husband returns to the  campsite 
and finds his wife in tears. One of her breasts has been  painted 
green, the other red and her ass is blue. 
<P>
"What on earth happened to you dear?" he asks. 
<P>
"Some  of  those rednecks from town came over and  told  me  they 
don't  allow any nakedness around these parts. Then they gave  me 
this paint job!" 
<P>
"Damn those trouble-makers! I'll fix them!" the husband shouts. 
<P>
He rides into town and finds the rednecks in a bar. 
<P>
"Who  is  the SOB who painted my wife red, green  and  blue!"  he 
shouts. 
<P>
A  huge  redneck, about 6'-8," steps forward, a  shotgun  in  his 
hands. "I did it," he bellows. "What you got to say about it?" 
<P>
The husband answers meekly, "I just wanted you to know the  first 
coat of paint is dry." 
<P>
