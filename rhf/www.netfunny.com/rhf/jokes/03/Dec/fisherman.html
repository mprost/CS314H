</PRE>One Saturday morning a fisherman gets up early, dresses quietly, gets his 
lunch made, puts on his long johns, grabs the dog and goes to the garage 
to hook up his boat to the truck and head down to his favorite fishing 
area. 
<P>
Coming out of his garage, he is pounded by a torrential downpour of rain. 
It's freezing, there is snow mixed in with the rain, and a hard wind is 
blowing with 50 mph. gusts. 
<P>
He retreats back into the garage and, in disgust, returns to the house and 
turns the TV on to the weather channel.  He finds it's going to be bad 
weather all day long, so he puts his boat back in the garage, quietly 
undresses, and slips back into bed. 
<P>
There he cuddles up to his wife's back, now with a different kind of 
anticipation, and whispers: "The weather out there is terrible!" 
<P>
To which she sleepily replies: "Can you believe my stupid husband is out 
fishing in that shit?!" 
<P>
