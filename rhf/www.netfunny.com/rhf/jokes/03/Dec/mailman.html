</PRE>One Monday morning a mailman is walking the neighborhood on his usual 
route. 
<P>
As he approaches one of the homes he notices that both cars are in the 
driveway, his wonder is cut short by Bob the homeowner coming out with 
a load of empty beer and liquor bottles. 
<P>
"Wow Bob, looks like you guys had a hell of a party last night." The 
Mailman comments. 
<P>
Bob in obvious pain replies," Actually we had it Saturday night, this is 
the first I have felt like moving since 4 am Sunday morning." We had a 
about fifteen couples from around the neighborhood over for the 
Christmas Cheer and got a bit wild. Hell we even got so drunk that 
around midnight we started playing WHO AM I." 
<P>
The Mailman thinks a moment and says, " How do you play that?" 
<P>
Bob continues between hung over gasps," Well all the guys go in the 
bedroom and we come out one at a time with a sheet covering us and only 
our "units" showing through a hole in the sheet. Then the women try to 
guess who it is." 
<P>
The Mailman laughs and says," Damn I am sorry I missed that." 
<P>
"Probably a good thing you did," Bob responds," your name was guessed 
four or five times." 
<P>
