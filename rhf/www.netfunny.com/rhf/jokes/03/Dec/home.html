</PRE>With the average cost for a nursing home reaching $188.00 per day, there 
is a better way to spend our savings, when we get old and feeble. 
<P>
I have already checked on reservations at the Holiday Inn for a combined 
long term stay discount and a senior discount. It comes to only $49.23 
per night. That leaves $138.77 a day for: 
<P>
1. Breakfast, lunch and dinner in any restaurant I want, or room 
service. 
<P>
2. Laundry, gratuities and special TV movies. Plus, they provide a 
swimming pool, a workout room, a lounge, washer, dryer,etc. Most have 
free toothpaste and razors, and all have free shampoo and soap. 
<P>
3. They treat you like a customer, not a patient. $5 worth of tips a day 
will have the entire staff scrambling to help you. 
<P>
4. There is city Bus stop out front, and seniors ride free. The Handicap 
bus will also pick you up (if you fake a decent limp). 
<P>
5. To meet other nice people, call a Church bus on Sundays. For a change 
of scenery, take the Airport shuttle Bus and eat at one of the nice 
restaurants there. While you're at the airport, fly somewhere. Otherwise 
the cash keeps building up. 
<P>
6. It takes months to get into decent nursing homes. Holiday Inn will 
take your reservation today. And - you are not stuck in one place 
forever, you can move from Inn to Inn, or even from city to city. Want 
to see Hawaii? They have a Holiday Inn there too. 
<P>
7. TV broken? Light bulbs need changing? Need a mattress replaced? No 
problem. They fix everything, and apologize for the inconvenience. 
<P>
8. The Inn has a night security person and daily room service. The maid 
checks to see if you are OK. If not, they will call the undertaker or an 
ambulance. If you fall and break a hip, Medicare will pay for the hip, 
and Holiday Inn will upgrade you to a suite for the rest of your life. 
<P>
9. And no worries about visits from family. They will always be glad to 
find you, and will probably check in for a few days mini-vacation. The 
grandkids can use the pool. 
<P>
What more can you ask for? 
<P>
So . . . 
<P>
When I reach the Golden age, I'll face it with a grin-- Just forward all 
my email to: me@Holiday_Inn! 
<P>
