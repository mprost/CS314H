</PRE>Ole was stopped by a game warden in Northern Minnesota recently 
leaving a lake well known for its Walleye. He had two buckets of 
fish. As it was during the spawning season, the game warden 
asked, "Do you have a license to catch those fish?" 
<P>
Ole replied, "No, sir! Dese here are my pet fish." 
<P>
"Pet fish?" the warden replied. 
<P>
"Ya sure, you betcha." answered Ole. "Every night I take dese 
fish here down to da lake and let dem svim around for a while. 
Den I vhistle and dey yump back into deir buckets and I take dem 
home." 
<P>
"That's a bunch of hooey. Fish can't do that." said the game 
warden. 
<P>
Ole looked at the game warden with an expression of great hurt, 
and then said, "Yumpin Yimminy! Vell den, I'll just show you den. 
It really does vork, don'tcha know?" 
<P>
"O.K. I've got to see this!" The game warden was really curious 
now. So Ole poured the fish into the lake and stood waiting. 
After several minutes, the game warden turned to Ole and said, 
"Well?" 
<P>
"Vell what?" responded Ole.. 
<P>
"When are you going to call them back?" 
<P>
"Call who back?" asked Ole. 
<P>
"The fish!" 
<P>
"What fish?" 
<P>
