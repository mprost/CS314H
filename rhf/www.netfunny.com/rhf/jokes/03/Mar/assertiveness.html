</PRE>A mild-mannered man was tired of being bossed around by his wife so 
he went to a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist said he needed to build 
his self-esteem, and so gave him a book on assertiveness, which he 
read on the way home. He had finished the book by the time he reached 
his house. 
<P>
The man stormed into the house and walked up to his wife.  Pointing a 
finger in her face, he said, "From now on, I want you to know that I 
am the man of this house, and my word is law! I want you to prepare 
me a gourmet meal tonight, and when I'm finished eating my meal, I 
expect a sumptuous dessert afterward. Then, after dinner, you're 
going to draw me my bath so I can relax. And when I'm finished with my 
bath, guess who's going to dress me and comb my hair?" 
<P>
"The funeral director," said his wife.
