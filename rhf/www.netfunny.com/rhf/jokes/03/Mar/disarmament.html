<BR>USA: (Knock)<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Come in.<BR>
USA: Ah, Is this the right place for disarmament?<BR>
Saddam Hussein: I told you once that I've disarmed.<BR>
USA: No you haven't.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: I've already disarmed.<BR>
USA: When?<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Just now.<BR>
USA: No you didn't.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Yes I did.<BR>
USA: You didn't<BR>
Saddam Hussein: I did!<BR>
USA: You didn't!<BR>
Saddam Hussein: I'm telling you I did!<BR>
USA: You did not!!<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Oh, I'm sorry, just one moment. Do you mean full disarmament<BR>
or just a couple of missiles?<BR>
USA: Oh, full disarmament.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Ah, thank you. Anyway, I did.<BR>
USA: You most certainly did not.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Look, let's get this thing clear; I quite definitely disarmed.<BR>
USA: No you did not.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Yes I did.<BR>
USA: No you didn't.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Yes I did.<BR>
USA: No you didn't.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Yes I did.<BR>
USA: No you didn't.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Yes I did.<BR>
USA: You didn't.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Did.<BR>
USA: Oh look, this isn't compliance with UN Resolution 1441.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Yes it is.<BR>
USA: No it isn't. It's just defiance.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: No it isn't.<BR>
USA: It is!<BR>
Saddam Hussein: It is not.<BR>
USA: Look, you just contradicted me.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: I did not.<BR>
USA: Oh you did!!<BR>
Saddam Hussein: No, no, no.<BR>
USA: You did just then.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Nonsense!<BR>
USA: Oh, this is futile!<BR>
Saddam Hussein: No it isn't.<BR>
USA: I came here for a full accounting for destruction of your weapons.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: No you didn't; no, you came here for compliance.<BR>
USA: Compliance isn't just saying "I've disarmed."<BR>
Saddam Hussein: It can be.<BR>
USA: No it can't. Compliance is revealing and destroying weapons of mass<BR>
destruction in full view of U.N. inspectors.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: No it isn't.<BR>
USA: Yes it is! It's not just empty statements.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Look, if I comply with the UN, I must say I've disarmed.<BR>
USA: Yes, but full disarmament isn't just saying "I've disarmed."<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Yes it is!<BR>
USA: No it isn't!<BR>
USA: Disarmament is an open process. Declarations of de-weaponizing absent<BR>
records or hard evidence of actual destruction of WMDs is useless.<BR>
<P>
Pause<BR>
<P>
Saddam Hussein: No it isn't.<BR>
USA: It is.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Not at all.<BR>
USA: Now look.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: (Rings bell) Good Morning.<BR>
USA: What?<BR>
Saddam Hussein: That's it. Good morning.<BR>
USA: I was just getting started.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Sorry, the inspections are done.<BR>
USA: That was never disarmament!<BR>
Saddam Hussein: I'm afraid it was.<BR>
USA: It wasn't.<BR>
<P>
Pause<BR>
<P>
Saddam Hussein: I'm sorry, but I'm not allowing inspections anymore.<BR>
USA: What?!<BR>
Saddam Hussein: If you want me to allow inspections, you'll have to pass<BR>
another UN resolution.<BR>
USA: Yes, but that was never compliance, just now. Oh come on!<BR>
Saddam Hussein: (Hums)<BR>
USA: Look, this is ridiculous.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to argue unless you've passed<BR>
another U.N. resolution.<BR>
USA: Oh, all right. (passes 18th resolution against Iraq)<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Thank you.<BR>
<P>
Pause<BR>
<P>
USA: Well?<BR>
Saddam Hussein: Well what?<BR>
USA: That wasn't really compliance, just now.<BR>
Saddam Hussein: I told you, I'm not going to allow inspections unless you've<BR>
passed a UN resolution.<BR>
USA: I just did!<BR>
Saddam Hussein: No you didn't.<BR>
USA: I DID!<BR>
Saddam Hussein: No you didn't.<BR>
