<BR>"Real Notes to British Milkmen":<BR>
<P>
* Dear Milkman, I've just had a baby, please leave another one.<BR>
<P>
* Please leave an extra pint of paralysed milk.<BR>
<P>
* Cancel one pint after the day after today.<BR>
<P>
* Please don't leave any more milk. All they do is drink it.<BR>
<P>
* Milkman, please close the gate behind you because the birds keep<BR>
pecking the tops off the milk.<BR>
<P>
* Milkman, please could I have a loaf but not bread today.<BR>
<P>
* Please cancel milk. I have nothing coming into the house but two sons<BR>
on the dole.<BR>
<P>
* Sorry not to have paid your bill before, but my wife had a baby and<BR>
I've been carrying it around in my pocket for weeks.<BR>
<P>
* Sorry about yesterday's note. I didn't mean one egg and a dozen pints,<BR>
but the other way round.<BR>
<P>
* When you leave my milk knock on my bedroom window and wake me because<BR>
I want you to give me a hand to turn the mattress.<BR>
<P>
* Please knock. My TV's broken down and I missed last night's<BR>
Coronation Street. If you saw it, will you tell me what happened over<BR>
a cup of tea.<BR>
<P>
* My daughter says she wants a milkshake. Do you do it before you<BR>
deliver or do I have to shake the bottle?<BR>
<P>
* Please send me a form for cheap milk, for I have a baby two months<BR>
old and did not know about it until a neighbour told me.<BR>
<P>
* Please send me details about cheap milk as I am stagnant. Milk is<BR>
needed for the baby. Father is unable to supply it.<BR>
<P>
* From now on please leave two pints every other day and one pint on<BR>
the days in between, except Wednesdays and Saturdays when I don't<BR>
want any milk.<BR>
<P>
* My back door is open. Please put milk in fridge, get money out of<BR>
cup in drawer and leave change on kitchen table in pence, because we<BR>
want to play bingo tonight.<BR>
<P>
* Please leave no milk today. When I say today, I mean tomorrow, for I<BR>
wrote this note yesterday.<BR>
<P>
* When you leave the milk please put the coal on the boiler, let dog out<BR>
and put newspaper inside the screen door. PS. Don't leave any milk.<BR>
<P>
* No milk. Please do not leave milk at No. 14 either as he is dead<BR>
until further notice.<BR>
<P>
