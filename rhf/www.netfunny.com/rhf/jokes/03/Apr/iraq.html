</PRE>Yet another Iraq digest.  These are jokes which are funny, but which 
didn't really warrant posting separately.  I post such a digest whenever 
I have enough entries to warrant it.  Particularly selective readers will 
probably not enjoy the digests, and may want to killfile RHF jokes with 
"Digest" in the title - ed.

&gt;Subject: Re: Iraq Quickies Digest<BR>
<P>
</PRE>I got this one from the letters column of a newspaper 
<P>
"It's not true that the French are ungrateful for what the Americans did 
in WW2.  In fact they're so inspired by the American example that they 
plan to wait two years until they personally are attacked, then join the 
coalition and pretend the war against Saddam was all their idea."

</PRE>Poland announced it has sent troops to the Gulf to help the coalition forces. 
<P>
Mexico has no idea what to do with them.

&gt;Subject: That makes us even<BR>
<P>
</PRE>[Excerpts from a phone call between George W. Bush and French president 
Jacques Chirac] 
<P>
Bush&gt; Remember, Jacques: if it weren't for our help in WWII, now you'd be 
speaking German. 
<P>
Chirac&gt; I know, but consider this: if it weren't for our help in the 
Independence war, you'd be speaking English.

&gt;Subject: Western Culture on the move<BR>
<P>
</PRE>As I watched the news of the riots and looting taking 
place all over Iraq after the Coalition troops moved 
out I couldn't help but think that they'd already 
gotten the hang of our latest tradition of having 
riots in the home town when your team wins the championship.

&gt;Subject: Looking forward<BR>
<P>
</PRE>At last our prayers have been answered: Iraqi people are about to become 
free of their anti-democratic, power-crazed, war-mongering, decisive, 
ruthless ruler. 
<P>
Now, friends, we start praying for American people.

&gt;Subject: Certainly Not In Baghdad<BR>
<P>
</PRE>As part of a discussion about what's the most eclectic place in 
the world, I argued that it had to be New York City.  As proof, 
I offered that New York is the only place in the world where on 
can find someone from the government of Iraq.

&gt;Subject: Subject:  Microsoft Hires Muhammed Saeed al-Sahhaf se new Spokesm<BR>
<P>
</PRE>(Redmond, Washington) 
<P>
In the latest press conference regarding the security issues surronunding, 
newly-hired Micorsoft spokesman Muhammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, reiterated that 
all security issues have been satisfactorily met in a webcast last Thursday: 
<P>
"Windows XP is a blessing upon the face of the world.  The Linux infidels 
lie like dogs in a Persian bathhouse when they boldfacedly tell you that 
Windows XP (R) has security holes.  The holes are in their dead, rotting 
corpses.  Windows XP has no faults as befits this blessing from the hands of 
the most high.  I know because I tell the truth"

&gt;Subject: Saddam Hussein (original)<BR>
<P>
</PRE>In 1985 Saddam Hussein, feeling no longer well-pampered 
by the US, complained: "You Americans, you treat the Third 
World in the way an Iraqi peasant treats his new bride. 
Three days of honeymoon, and then it's off to the fields." 
<P>
It took him another 18 years to realize it wasn't at 
all like an Iraqi peasant wedding.  It was like 
an American wedding, complete with divorce, 
denunciations, and bitter custody battle.

&gt;Subject: French bashing<BR>
<P>
[Forwarded]<BR>
<P>
My favorite bumper sticker in Washington D.C. right now is the one that says<BR>
'First Iraq, then France'."<BR>
-- Tom Brokaw<BR>
<P>
"The French announced today that they would not help us remove Saddam from<BR>
Iraq. Well Duh! They didn't even help us remove Hitler from France."<BR>
-- Jay Leno<BR>
<P>
"France said this week they need more evidence to convince them Saddam is a<BR>
threat. Yeah, last time France asked for more evidence it came rollin thru<BR>
Paris with a German Flag on it."<BR>
-- Dave Letterman<BR>
<P>
.......and my all time favorite!  Why are all the highways in France lined<BR>
with trees?  So the Germans can march in the shade!!!<BR>
<P>
France has neither winter, nor summer, nor morals.  France is miserable<BR>
because it is filled with Frenchmen, and Frenchmen are miserable because<BR>
they live in France.<BR>
-- Mark Twain<BR>
<P>
Only thing worse than a Frenchman is a Frenchman who lives in Canada.<BR>
-- Ted Nugent<BR>
<P>
The only way the French are going in with us is if we tell them we found<BR>
truffles in Iraq.<BR>
<P>
War without France would be like ... uh ... World War II<BR>
<P>
What do you call 100,000 Frenchmen with their hands up?<BR>
-- The French Army<BR>
<P>
Q. How do you stop a French Tank?<BR>
A. Shoot the guy pushing.<BR>
<P>
Q. how many Frenchman does it take to defend Paris.<BR>
A. We don't know, it's never been tried.<BR>
<P>
The best French bashing line heard over the last week is: "We can count on<BR>
the French to be there when they need us."<BR>

&gt;Subject: New Iraq War Tactics<BR>
<P>
</PRE>This is an actual headline from Yahoo! News April 3, 2003: 
<P>
Rumsfeld Asks Iraqi Military to Turn on Saddam 
<P>
Well, at least the new war plan is creative, if a little kinky.

&gt;Subject: Another Frenchie gone<BR>
<P>
</PRE>&gt;From a community broadcaster in Moab, Utah: 
<P>
Authorities in New York are reporting the disappearance of the Statue of 
Liberty.  Investigators say she was last seen swimming back to France.
