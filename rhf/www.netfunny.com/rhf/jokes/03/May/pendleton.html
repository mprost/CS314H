</PRE>A LETTER FROM A FARMER, NOW AT CAMP PENDLETON 
<P>
Dear Ma and Pa; 
<P>
Am well. Hope you are. Tell Brother Walt and Brother Elmer the Marine 
Corps beats working for the old man by a mile. Tell them to join up 
quick before maybe all of the places are filled. I was restless at 
first because you got to stay in bed till nearly 6 a.m., but am 
getting so I like to sleep late. 
<P>
Tell Walt and Elmer all you do before breakfast is smooth your cot and 
shine some things. No hogs to slop, feed to pitch, mash to mix, wood 
to split, fire to lay. Practically nothing. Men got to shave but it is 
not so bad, there is warm water. 
<P>
Breakfast is strong on trimmings like fruit juice, cereal, eggs, 
bacon, etc..., but kind of weak on chops, potatoes, ham, steak, fried 
eggplant, pie and other regular food. But tell Walt and Elmer you can 
always sit between boys that live on coffee. Their food plus yours 
holds you till noon, when you get fed again. It's no wonder these city 
boys can't walk much. 
<P>
Marches, which the Platoon Sergeant says are long walks to harden us. 
If he thinks so, it is not my place to tell him different. It is about 
as far as to our mailbox at home. Then the city guys gets sore feet 
and we all ride back in trucks. The country is nice but awful 
flat. The Sergeant is like a schoolteacher. He nags some. 
<P>
The Capt. is like the school board. Majors and Colonels just ride 
around and frown. They don't bother you none. 
<P>
This next will kill Walt and Elmer with laughing. I keep getting 
medals for shooting. I don't know why. The bulls-eye is near as big as 
a chipmunk and don't move. And it ain't shooting at you, like the 
Higgett boys at home. All you got to do is lie there all comfortable 
and hit it. You don't even load your own cartridges. They come in 
boxes. 
<P>
Be sure to tell Walt and Elmer to hurry and join before other fellers 
get onto this setup and come stampeding in. 
<P>
Your loving daughter, Gail 
<P>
