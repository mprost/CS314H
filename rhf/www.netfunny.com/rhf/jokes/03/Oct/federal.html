</PRE>A recent posting to rec.humor.funny.reruns about police diplomacy reminds 
me of a story related by a friend about a vet student that he knew in 
college. 
<P>
Apparently one of the limited summer job options available to vet students 
is to work for the USDA as a meat inspector.  This involves driving 
around to meat-packing plants to check that the meat is handled properly, 
that it meets minimum requirements for the grade at which it is marked, 
and so on.  The inspectors are even issued a badge to assert their 
authority as a U.S. Government agent. 
<P>
One day the poor vet student wakes up late for work, so she rushes to get 
dressed, hops in the car, tosses her badge on the dashboard, and zooms off 
to the first inspection site of the day. 
<P>
Naturally, she gets pulled over by a police officer, who informs her that 
she was speeding.  As she hands him her license and registration, he 
gestures to the dashboard. 
<P>
"Is that a state badge, ma'am?" 
<P>
She looks at the dashboard, then looks up at him. 
<P>
"Actually," she says, "it's Federal." 
<P>
He hands her back her papers, tips his hat, and says, "You're free to go. 
Have a good day." 
<P>
