</PRE>A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in 
front of him.   When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a very 
large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf 
balls. 
<P>
He then asked the students if the jar was full.  They agreed that it 
was. 
<P>
So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into 
the jar.  He shook the jar lightly.  The pebbles rolled into the open 
areas between golf balls. 
<P>
He then asked the students again if the jar was full.  They agreed it 
was. 
<P>
The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. 
Of course, the sand filled up everything else. 
<P>
He asked once more if the jar was full.  The students responded with a 
unanimous "yes." 
<P>
The professor then produced two cans of beer from under the table and 
poured the entire contents into the jar, effectively filling the empty 
space between the sand.  The students laughed. 
<P>
"Now," said the professor, as the laughter subsided, "I want you to 
recognize that this jar represents your life.  The golf balls are the 
important things--your family, your children, your health, your 
friends, your favorite passions--things that if everything else was 
lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. 
<P>
"The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your 
house, your car. 
<P>
The sand is everything else--the small stuff. 
<P>
"If you put the sand into the jar first," he continued, "there is no 
room for the pebbles or the golf balls.  The same goes for life.  If 
you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never 
have room for the things that are important to you.  Pay attention to 
the things that are critical to your happiness.  Play with your 
children.  Take time to get medical checkups.  Take your partner out 
to dinner.  Play another 18.  There will always be time to clean the 
house, and fix the disposal. 
<P>
"Take care of the golf balls first, the things that really matter. 
Set your  priorities.  The rest is just sand." 
<P>
One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the beer 
represented. 
<P>
The professor smiled.  "I'm glad you asked.  It just goes to show you 
that no matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a 
couple of beers." 
<P>
