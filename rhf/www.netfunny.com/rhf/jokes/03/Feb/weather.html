<BR>I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and my brother lives in Madison,<BR>
Wisconsin.  This time of year I get a sick pleasure out of taunting him<BR>
about the difference in the weather.  It was about 70 degrees and sunny<BR>
when I spotted the following weather advisory, so naturally I forwarded<BR>
to my brother:<BR>
<P>
<BR>Columbia-dane-dodge-fond du lac-green lake-iowa-marquette-sauk-sheboygan-<BR>
including the cities of...Portage...Beaver dam...Sheboygan...<BR>
Madison...Fond du lac...Dodgeville...Baraboo...<BR>
Montello and Green Lake<BR>
<P>
...Wind chill advisory for late tonight and early Wednesday remains<BR>
in effect...<BR>
<P>
Temperatures falling to near Zero late tonight will Combine with<BR>
gusty Northwest winds of 15 to 25 mph...To generate wind chills from<BR>
20 to 25 degrees below Zero. The dangerous wind chills will continue<BR>
through about mid morning on Wednesday...With values rising as the<BR>
temperatures gradually rise by mid-day.<BR>
<P>
A Wind Chill Advisory is issued when a Strong wind will Combine with<BR>
cold temperatures...To create dangerously cold conditions for exposed<BR>
skin. The wind will make it feel like it is 20 degrees below Zero or<BR>
colder...For a period of several hours. Those planning to venture<BR>
outdoors should use common sense and dress warmly...Making sure that<BR>
all exposed skin is covered. At these wind chill temperatures it<BR>
takes only 30 minuites for frostbite to occur on exposed skin.<BR>
<P>
</PRE>He responded by sending me this: 
<P>
<BR>marin-sonoma-solano-contra costa-san francisco-alameda-san mateo-santa clara<BR>
counties including the cities of...san francisco...oakland...berkeley...<BR>
san jose...woodland hills...cupertino...<BR>
<P>
...Aggravation Advisory for late tonight and early Wednesday remains<BR>
in effect...<BR>
Asking prices rising to near 8-Zeroes late tonight will Combine with<BR>
slowing 101 and 880 traffic jams of 5 to 10 mph...To generate aesthetic<BR>
chills from 20 to 25 malls per sq mile. The dangerous development chills<BR>
will continue through about mid morning on Wednesday...With property values<BR>
rising as the  number of Pottery Barns gradually increase by mid-day.<BR>
An Aggravation Advisory is issued when a Strong wind of economic reality<BR>
will Combine with inflated housing prices and traffic nightmare conditions...<BR>
To create dangerously aggravating conditions for exposed persons. The "wind"<BR>
will make it feel like one's stock is 80 percent below last year's value<BR>
while the house one wants is 350% above one's ability to buy.  Those<BR>
planning to venture capital should use common sense and dress warmly...<BR>
Making sure that all exposed investment is covered. In these conditions it<BR>
takes only 30 minutes to not be able to afford a 1 bedroom 1 bath 550 sq ft<BR>
condo in Hayward.<BR>
<P>
Maybe I'll just keep my mouth shut from now on.  :-)<BR>
