</PRE>Little Melissa comes home from first grade and tells her father that they 
learned about the history of Valentine's Day.  "Since Valentine's Day is 
for a Christian saint and we're Jewish," she asks, "will God get mad at 
me for giving someone a valentine?" 
<P>
Melissa's father thinks a bit,then says, "No, I don't think God would get 
mad. Who do you want to give a valentine to?" 
<P>
"Osama bin Laden," she says. 
<P>
"Why Osama bin Laden?" her father asks in shock. 
<P>
"Well," she says, "I thought that if a little American Jewish girl could 
have enough love to give Osama a valentine, he might start to think that 
maybe we're not all bad, and maybe start loving people a little bit. 
And if other kids saw what I did and sent valentines to Osama, he'd love 
everyone a lot.  And then he'd start going all over the place to tell 
everyone how much he loved them and how he didn't hate anyone anymore." 
<P>
Her father's heart swells and he looks at his daughter with newfound pride. 
"Melissa, that's the most wonderful thing  I've ever heard." 
<P>
"I know," Melissa says, "and once that gets him out in the open, our 
Marines could blow the shit out of him."
