</PRE>*&lt;Adjective&gt; Computer Worm &lt;verb&gt; Internet* 
<P>
In the wee hours of &lt;date&gt;, a &lt;adjective&gt; computer worm spread &lt;adverb&gt; 
throughout the Internet. Dubbed &lt;silly name&gt; because &lt;ridiculous reason 
that doesn't explain anything about how it works&gt;, and also known as 
&lt;another random name&gt; and &lt;another random name&gt;, the worm has infected 
an estimated &lt;number&gt; systems within &lt;length of time&gt;. Experts are 
calling this worm the most &lt;adjective&gt; since &lt;date in the past&gt;. 
<P>
The worm exploits a hole in &lt;Microsoft product name&gt; that was first 
identified &lt;number&gt; months ago by &lt;security company name&gt;. In an attempt 
to secure the planet, &lt;same company&gt; released detailed information about 
the vulnerability and how to exploit it. They also mentioned how to fix 
it, but apparently &lt;noun&gt; listened. Coincidentally, the worm that 
exploited this hole was also first identified by &lt;same company&gt;. Even 
more coincidentally, they make a product to protect against &lt;noun&gt;. 
<P>
"Actually, it's not really a &lt;noun&gt;, it's a &lt;noun&gt;," said &lt;Pete 
Lindstrom, or some other person seeking publicity&gt;. " A true &lt;noun&gt; 
works by &lt;random filler that nobody will read&gt;." 
<P>
The worm's payload &lt;verb&gt; every system by &lt;verb ending in -ing&gt; the 
&lt;noun&gt;. Comparatively speaking, this is much worse than &lt;another worm&gt; 
but not as bad as &lt;another worm&gt;. The computers of &lt;place&gt; were hit the 
hardest. Current damage is estimated at &lt;dollar figure more than the GNP 
of two-thirds of the world's nations&gt;. " This worm has the potential to 
&lt;something or other&gt;," said &lt;Pete Lindstrom, or some other person trying 
hard to come up with something interesting to say ;-)&gt;. " It just goes 
to show you that &lt;another something or other&gt;." 
<P>
Though there is no way to protect against this particular bug, experts 
recommend trying &lt;longshot one&gt; or &lt;longshot two&gt;, neither of which 
matter, since nobody will do it anyway.
