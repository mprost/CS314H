</PRE>HER DIARY 
<P>
Sunday night - I thought he was acting weird. We had made plans to meet 
at a bar to have a drink. I was shopping with my friends all day long, 
so I thought he was upset at the fact that I was a bit late, but he made 
no comment. 
<P>
Conversation wasn't flowing so I suggested that we go somewhere quiet 
so we could talk, he agreed but he kept quiet and absent. 
<P>
I asked him what was wrong - he said, "Nothing." 
<P>
I asked him if it was my fault that he was upset. He said it had 
nothing to do with me and not to worry. 
<P>
On the way home I told him that I loved him, he simply smiled and kept 
driving. 
<P>
I can't explain his behavior; I don't know why he didn't say, "I love 
you, too." 
<P>
When we got home I felt as if I had lost him, as if he wanted nothing 
to do with me anymore. 
<P>
He just sat there and watched TV.; he seemed distant and absent. 
<P>
Finally I decided to go to bed. About 10 minutes later he came to bed 
and to my surprise he responded to my caress and we made love, but I 
still felt that he was distracted and his thoughts were somewhere else. 
<P>
I decided that I could not take it anymore, so I decided to confront 
him with the situation but he had fallen asleep. 
<P>
I started crying and cried until I too fell asleep. 
<P>
I don't know what to do. I'm almost sure that his thoughts are with 
someone else. 
<P>
My life is a disaster. 
<P>
HIS DIARY 
<P>
Today the Yankees lost, but at least I got laid. 
<P>
[Note - making the rounds anonymously (and always with a different team in the 
punchline) - ed.]
