The following is an old anecdote, but a good one. Sometime in the early 1900's, 
P. T. Barnum, the owner of the Barnum &amp; Bailey circus and originator of the 
phrase "There's a sucker born every minute" offered $10,000 in cash to any person 
who could thoroughly dupe, or sucker, him. 
<P>
Barnum was always looking for interesting new acts or novel creatures to 
exhibit, and one day he received a letter from a fellow in Maine who claimed 
to possess a cherry-colored cat and asked if Barnum were interested in such 
a thing for his circus. Barnum contacted the man and said yes, if the cat were 
truly cherry-colored, he'd gladly put it on display. Well, a few days later 
a crate marked "live animal" arrived for him. When Barnum opened it, he found 
a somewhat frightened but otherwise perfectly ordinary-looking black housecat 
inside, along with a note which read: 
<P>
<!--  n-->
<P>
<BR><P>
<blockquote>Maine cherries are black.<BR>
There's a sucker born every minute...<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
Thoroughly tickled, Barnum sent the man a check for $10,000. (I'm not sure 
what happened to the cat, I think Barnum may have kept it as a reminder of the 
day he got suckered.)
