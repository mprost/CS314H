I heard these from my father, who heard them from a friend, etc. 
They're definitely not original.

A young man is jogging through a park when he sees an old man sitting 
on a bench sobbing. Concerned, he stops by the bench. "Is there anything I can 
do for you, sir?" 
<P>
"Oh," sobs the old man, "everything's wonderful. I just married a 
gorgeous twenty-year old who'll do anything for me, and even my children love 
her. We have a beautiful house, a pool..." 
<P>
"So what's the matter?" the puzzled young man asks. 
<P>
"I can't remember where I live!"

Three old ladies are sitting in a diner, chatting about various things. 
One lady says, "You know, I'm getting really forgetful. This morning, I was 
standing at the top of the stairs, and I couldn't remember whether I had just 
come up or was about to go down." 
<P>
The second lady says, "You think that's bad? The other day, I was 
sitting on the edge of my bed, and I couldn't remember whether I was going to 
bed or had just woken up!" 
<P>
The third lady smiles smugly. "Well, my memory's just as good as it's 
always been, knock wood." She raps the table. With a startled look on her face, 
she asks, "Who's there?"
