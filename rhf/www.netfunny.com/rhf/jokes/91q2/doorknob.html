<PRE>	The newlywed couple arrives in their sumptous honeymoon 
suite, and it turns out that they are both virgins.  Brought up the
old traditional way, neither of them really knows how to have sex.
So after about half a painful hour of abortive attempts to get it on,
an idea occurs to the husband.  
	"Ok, honey", he says, "this is what we'll do.  I'll go into
the closet, and you go into the bathroom.  We'll both get undressed
and turn off the lights in the bedroom.  And then, on the count
of three, we'll both rush out at each other and then it will just
happen in the middle of the bedroom." 
	The wife is a bit unsure about this, but since she doesn't have
any better ideas, she agrees.  So, the husband goes into the closet
and the wife goes into the bathroom and they both get undressed.  The
anticipation is driving the husband mad, and as he takes off his
clothes he begins to get an enormous erection.  The wife turns off the
lights and on the count of three, they both rush out into the bedroom
towards each other.  However, since the room is dark, the husband 
gets disoriented and runs by his wife...right into the dresser.  He hits
his willy against the dresser so <b>hard</b> that he passes out from the pain.
The next thing he remembers is coming to in a hospital bed, with a
doctor looking down at him.  His throbbing dick is still so painful that
he moans to the doctor "Doc, doc, how bad is it?" to which the doctor
replied,

	"That's nothing, son -  wait till you see your wife!  
	 We still haven't gotten her off the doorknob yet."
