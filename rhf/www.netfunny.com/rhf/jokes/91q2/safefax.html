Q:  Do I have to be married to have fax? 
<P>
A:  Although married people fax quite often, there are many single people 
who fax complete strangers every day. 
<P>
Q:  My parents say they never had fax when they were young and were 
only allowed to write memos to each other until they were 21.  How old 
do you think someone should be before they can fax? 
<P>
A:  Faxing can be 
performed at any age, once you learn the correct procedures. 
<P>
Q:  If I fax something to myself, will I go blind? 
<P>
A:  Certainly not, as far as we can see. 
<P>
Q:  There is a place on our street where you can go and pay to fax. 
Is this legal? 
<P>
A:  Yes.  Many people have no other outlet for their fax drives and 
must pay a "professional" when their need to fax becomes too great. 
<P>
Q:  Should a cover always be used before faxing? 
<P>
A:  Unless you are really sure of the one you are faxing, a cover should 
be used to insure safe fax.
