Our Engineering group is planning on participating in a "team building"
exercise.  As a prelude, each of us had to take the famous Myers-Briggs
test to evaluate personalities, leadership attributes, etc.

After taking my test, I came up with one of my own:

                                     By

                                Bryer's-Migs
      (The people who bring you natural ice cream and Soviet warplanes)

are no RIGHT or WRONG answers.  Answer each question honestly and
