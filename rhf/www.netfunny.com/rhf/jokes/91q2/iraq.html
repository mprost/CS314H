<BR>&gt;&gt; From: hussein@chem.weapons.nyu.edu<BR>
&gt;&gt; Subject: ROOMMATE WANTED<BR>
&gt;&gt; Message-ID: &lt;1991.ass.kicked@chem.weapons.nyu.edu&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; Date: 24 Feb 91 00:00:00 GMT<BR>
<P>
</PRE>Hello! My name is Saddam Hussein. I recently moved to 
New York.  I am looking for a roommate to share my 
basement apartment at 1991 Bombs Helter # -1, NY. 
The apartment is well furnished with 3 machine guns, 
6 toy guns, and 4 hand grenades. I must admit it is 
in a rather rough neighborhood, but since we will be 
living underground, we will have nothing to worry about. 
<P>
I go to school at NYU. I am trying to major in Chemistry, 
my minor is Weapon Systems. I spend most of my time in the 
lab conducting experiments. I rarely find time for anything 
else. Sometimes, not even to read light bulb and matchbox jokes 
on RHF. I used to work part-time at a nearby Gulf station, but 
was laid off when gas prices went down. I need cash desperately, 
and a roommate.... 
<P>

P.S.: Please don't reply to this account. I have reasons to 
believe my incoming e-mails are being intercepted by the CIA.

Some commercial for the local bar "BULLWINKLE'S" was advertising a party

On the contrary, SCUD jokes are very popular, though mostly silly (I wonder 
if staying too long in a sealed room affects one's brain?).  Some examples: 
<P>
Where does Saddam hide his missiles?  In Scudinavia! 
<P>
What kind of car does he drive?  A Scudillac! 
<P>
What should one do before crossing a street in Ramat-Gan [the town which had 
the most hits]?  Look to the right, to the left, and upwards! 
<P>
(From a stand-up comic on TV): "They told us the chances of being hit by 
a SCUD are like winning the big prize in the state lottery.  But they 
forgot to tell us there are going to be three drawings every night!" 
<P>
(This should be rot-13):  What's the best thing a man can do while making love 
wearing gas masks?  Plug her air filter--she'll move like she's never 
moved before!

Have you ever noticed that Rickey Henderson and Saddam Hussein are the same 
man?  They must be, since, besides never seeing them in the same place, 
they both have a sudden need for extra money that they didn't have a year ago 
and both make their living while running.

This was told to me by my girlfriend... it was told to her by a co-worker 
whose brother just got home from the Gulf region.  He flew on some of the 
air sorties, firing some of the "smart" technology weapons. 
<P>
Apparently, for several missions this group had been trying to knock out one 
particularly well-constructed bunker which contained an ammo depot, plus some 
control operations centers.  Several hits to the roof (highly reinforced 
concrete) proved to be ineffective.  So, at one pre-mission briefing, our 
pilot is told to use a "smart" weapon against the FRONT DOOR of the bunker. 
The actual target was, in fact, the door lock and handle mechanism, in hopes 
that a direct hit would make access to the bunker more difficult. 
<P>
So the mission goes up as scheduled, and the pilot "acquires" his target (the 
door lock) and fires.  As the door was almost as sturdy as the walls, they 
thought there would be detonation right on the door, but to their surprise the 
missile kept going right inside the bunker and detonated... in quite a 
impressive manner, apparently. 
<P>
Video footage shot from the plane showed that, about one second before the 
missile was to hit, an Iraqi solder had opened the door! 
<P>
(I can't guarantee it, but this is supposed to be true)

[This has been haunting me--I hope it is not deja vu] 
<P>
[Wash., D.C.]--In a press conference today, President Bush announced 
that, in light of the great popularity he is enjoying, he wants to be 
described in news reports as "American Strongman George Bush."  "President 
Bush, while respectful, just does not have that ring to it."  Recent 
events in the Middle East, and Panama have demonstrated not only his 
manhood but his strength. 
<P>
When asked if the title shouldn't be changed to "North American 
Strongman," Bush replied that any tinpot dictator that wanted to take 
the title away from him, should just go ahead and try.  "After all, 
why should Manuel get a title like that when I helped him get where he 
got?" 
<P>
"This should put to rest any lingering doubts in the minds of the people 
about my manhood.  I can now take it out of escrow."
