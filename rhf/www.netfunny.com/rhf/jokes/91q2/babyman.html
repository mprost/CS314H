<PRE>BABY(1)                  USER COMMANDS                    BABY(1)

NAME
     BABY - create new process from two parent processes

SYNOPSIS
     BABY sex [ name ]

SYSTEM V SYNOPSIS
     /usr/5bin/BABY [ -sex ] [ -name ]

AVAILABILITY
     The System V version of this command is available with the Sys-
     tem  V  software  installation  option.  Refer to Installing
     SunOS 4.1 for information on how to install and invoke BABY. 

DESCRIPTION
     BABY is initiated when one parent process polls another server
process through a socket connection (BSD) or through pipes in the
system V implementation. BABY runs at a low priority for approximately
40 weeks then terminates with heavy system load. Most systems require
constant monitering when BABY reaches it's final stages of execution.

	Older implentations of BABY required that the initiating
process not be present at the time of completion, In these versions
the initiating process is awakened and notified of the results upon
completion. Modern versions allow both parent processes to be active
during the final stages of BABY.


          example% BABY -sex m -name fred

OPTIONS
	
	-sex 
	  option indicating type of process created. 

	-name
          process identification to be attaced to the new process.

RESULT
     Successful execution of the BABY(1) results in new process
     being created and named. Parent processes then typically
     broadcast messages to all other processes informing them of their
     new status in the system.


BUGS
     The SLEEP command may not work on either parent processes for some
     time afterward, as new BABY processes constantly send interrupts
     which must be handled by one or more parent.
 
     BABY processes upon being created may frequently dump 
     in /tmp requireing /tmp to be cleaned out frequently by one
     of the parent processes.
	
     The original AT&amp;T version was provided without instuctions
     regarding the created process, this remains in current implementations.

SEE ALSO
	cigars(6) dump(5) cry(3)

OTHER IMPLEMENTATIONS
	
	gnoops(1)
	   FSF version of BABY where none of the authors will accept 
	   responsibility for anything.

NOTES

	baby -sex f -name Cathryn Leigh Beck 

        completed sucessfully at the Grey Nuns Hospital on March 30 at
	9:59 P.M. after 5 hours of labour. New Mom Chenelle is doing
	fine, as is the baby, Dad is tickled pink. Both will probably
	come home sometime on Teusday. More information can be gotten
	from Dad by e-mail or when he brings his new little girl by to
	show her off (should be soon) Celebrations can probably begin
	in earnest after Dad catches up on all the work he couldn't do
	this weekend. 
		

Sun Release 4.1    Last change: Just before I left the hospital last.
