Announcing, from Low-Life Books,<BR>
<P>
MYSTERIES OF THE OVERBLOWN<BR>
</center>
<P>
This provocative new book series provides amazingly arbitrary 
explanations to events which lie entirely within ordinary reality. 
Just listen to some of the stories described within ... 
<P>
 o  In Malibu, CA, a woman suddenly feels that her grandson in New York 
has just received a phone call bringing terrible news.  She places a 
frantic, long distance call ... and <I>the line is busy</I>. 
<P>
<CENTER>...IT'S DISMISSED AS COINCIDENCE</CENTER><BR>
<P>
 o  A group of youths in a wooded clearing are held aloft by an unseen force. 
They report hearing "wow, like, really freaky noises, man." 
<P>
<CENTER>...IT'S DISMISSED AS "BAD" ACID</CENTER><BR>
<P>
 o  As reported by dozens of observers, numerous glowing lights appear in the 
night sky over Denver, remaining until dawn. 
<P>
<CENTER>...IT'S DISMISSED AS STARS</CENTER><BR>
<P>
 o  In Lynchburg, VA, a man sticks a fork in a toaster when suddenly a bolt 
of energy shoots up his arm, knocking him unconscious. 
<P>
<CENTER>...IT'S DISMISSED AS STUPIDITY</CENTER><BR>
<P>
We can no longer afford to ignore things which may not be complete 
fabrications.  Act now and you'll receive the exciting first book, 
"THINGS THAT GO BUMP IN THE NIGHT."  After that, you'll receive one 
book per month.  If you don't want it, send it back within 30 seconds 
for a full refund.  Many exciting titles await, from "SPOOKY NOISES" to 
"HOW TO TELL IF YOU'RE REALLY FROM ANOTHER PLANET." 
<P>
Each book is $89.90, billable in 10 monthly installments of 
<P>
<CENTER>ONLY $8.99 EACH!!</CENTER><BR>
