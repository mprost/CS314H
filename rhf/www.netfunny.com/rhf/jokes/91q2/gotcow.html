While out Looking For A Place To Hunt: (supposedly true) 
<P>
A carload of hunters, looking for a place to hunt, pulled into 
a farmer's yard. The driver went up to the farmhouse to ask permission 
to hunt. The old farmer said, "Sure you can hunt, but would you 
do me a favor? That old mule standing over there is 20 years old 
and sick with cancer, but I don't have the heart to kill her. Would 
you do it for me?" The hunter said, "Sure," and headed for the car. 
<P>
While walking back, however, he decided to pull a trick on his 
hunting buddies. He got into the car and when they asked if the 
farmer had said OK, he said, "No, we can't hunt here, but I'm going 
to teach that old cuss a lesson." With that, he rolled down his 
window, stuck his gun out and blasted the mule. As he exclaimed, 
"There, that will teach him!" a second shot rang out from the 
passenger side. And, one of his hunting buddies shouted, "I got 
the cow!"
