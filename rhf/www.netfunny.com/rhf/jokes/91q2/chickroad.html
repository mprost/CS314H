<H4>Famous Peoples' Conjectures</H4>
<P>
<H4>On Why the Chicken Crossed the Road</H4>
<P>
Walt Whitman: To cluck the song of itself. 
<P>
Jack Nicholson: 'Cause it (censored) wanted to.  That's the (censored) 
reason. 
<P>
John Paul Jones: It has not yet begun to cross! 
<P>
Ralph Waldo Emerson: It didn't cross the road; it transcended it. 
<P>
Aristotle: To actualize its potential. 
<P>
Roseanne Barr: Urrrrrp.  What chicken? 
<P>
Pyrrho the Skeptic: What road? 
<P>
William Shakespeare: I don't know why, but methinks I could rattle off a 
hundred-line soliloquy without much ado. 
<P>
Thomas Paine: Out of common sense. 
<P>
TS Eliot: Weialala leia / Wallala leialala. 
<P>
Groucho Marx: Chicken?  What's all this talk about chicken?  Why, I had an 
uncle who thought he was a chicken.  My aunt almost divorced him, but we 
needed the eggs. 
<P>
Karl Marx: To escape the bourgeois middle-class struggle. 
<P>
Mark Twain: The news of its crossing has been greatly exaggerated. 
<P>
Mr. Scott: 'Cos ma wee transporter beam was na functioning proprely. 
Ah canna work miracles, captain! 
<P>
Robert Frost: To cross the road less traveled by. 
<P>
Sigmund Freud: The chicken obviously was female and obviously interpreted 
the pole on which the crosswalk sign was mounted as a phallic symbol of 
which she was envious, selbstverstaendlich. 
<P>
William Wordsworth: To have something to recollect in tranquility. 
<P>
Caesar: To come, to see, to conquer. 
<P>
Bill the Cat: Oop Ack. 
<P>
Rene Descartes: It had sufficient reason to believe it was dreaming anyway. 
<P>
Leda: Are you sure it wasn't Zeus dressed up as a chicken?  He's into that 
kind of thing, you know. 
<P>
Zsa Zsa Gabor: It probably crossed to get a better look at my legs, which 
thank goodness are good, dahling. 
<P>
George Bush: To face a kinder, gentler thousand points of headlights.

TS Eliot revisited: Do I dare to cross the road? 
<P>
Zeno of Elea: To prove it could never reach the other side. 
<P>
Emily Dickinson: Because it could not stop for death. 
<P>
Howard Cosell: It may very well have been one of the most astonishing 
events to grace the annals of history.  An historic, unprecedented avian 
biped with the temerity to attempt such an herculean achievement formerly 
relegated to homo sapien pedestrians is truly a remarkable occurrence. 
<P>
Gregor Mendel: To get various strains of roads. 
<P>

its forward momentum. 
<P>

it to cross. 
<P>
Candide: To cultivate its garden. 
<P>
George Washington: Actually it crossed the Delaware with me back in 1776. 
But most history books don't reveal that I bunked with a birdie during 
the duration. 
<P>

<P>
David Hume: Out of custom and habit. 
<P>

<P>
Ernest Hemingway: To die. In the rain. 
<P>
Gilligan: The traffic started getting rough; the chicken had to cross. 
If not for the plumage of its peerless tail the chicken would be lost. 
The chicken would be lost!

<P>
Socrates: To pick up some hemlock at the corner druggist.

This collection of Chicken Jokes was dreamed up by the staff 
members of the Calvin College Dialogue last year.  Now I was a staff 
member, and I wrote some of the jokes myself, but the others (Steve Mulder, 
Heather Gemmen, et al.) wrote many of them as well.
