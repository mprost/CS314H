<PRE>    A is for APPLE who sent us our Macs, 
    D is for DEC, and they sold us a Vax. 
    C is the language in which we write source, 
and B is our sort, which is BROKEN, of course. 
<P>
    E is an ERROR when code is compiled, 
    F is a FORK for creating a child, 
    G is the GETTY that sits on the line, 
and H is a HANGUP whic<tt>:^?{^Zo^?{bD^]NO CARRIER</tt> 
<P>
    I is the INTERCONNECTION of kit, 
    J is the JOY when the cables all fit. 
    K is for KERMIT, to copy a file, 
and L are the LINES that we drop all the while. 
<P>
    M is the MODEM we use from our home, 
    N are the NIGHTS which we spend on the 'phone, 
    O is the OUTPUT we get from the host, 
and P are the 'PHONE BILLS we get in the post. 
<P>
    Q for SIGQUIT makes our process abort, 
    R is the REASON sigquit should be caught. 
    S is the SIGNAL we catch and ignore, 
and T is the TRAP which we miss, and dump core. 
<P>
    U is for UNIX--I hope that is clear, 
    V is the VISUAL editor here. 
    W stands for the WINDOWS we use, 
and X for the windowing system we choose. 
<P>
    Y is for YACC, quite a specialist tool, 
    Z for the snores from the programming pool. 
    Written while waiting while dinner was cooking
