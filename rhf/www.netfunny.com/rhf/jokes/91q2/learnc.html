<PRE>[ I got this from Ann Gordon, a fellow student.  It is based on the
first chapter of the book "All I Really Need to Know I Learned in
Kindergarten."  Posted with her permission.  CAEN labs are the computer
labs for engineering students here at the University of Michigan. ]



All I Really Need to Know I Learned from My Computer


All I really need to know about how to live and what to do and how to be I
learned right here in the CAEN labs. Illumination was not at the top of the
graduate school mountain, but right there in front of the computer
monitors. These are the things I learned. Everything you need to know is
here somewhere:

        1.      Share all your executables.
        2.      Pay for your shareware.
        3.      Don't hit the computer.
        4.      Back up files after you have found them.
        5.      Clean up your own messy desktop.
        6.      Don't copy software that is not yours.
        7.      Make a smiley when you send someone a nasty message.
        8.      Wash your hands before you type.
        9.      Flush your buffers.
        10.     M&amp;Ms and a cold can of Coke are good for you.
        11.     Live a student's life--learn some and think some and
                MacDraw and IPaint and Readnews and play Tetris and hack
                every day some.
        12.     Take a break every two hours from staring at the terminal.
        13.     When you go out in the world, watch out for network traffic,
                hold connections and stick together.
        14.     Be aware of wonder. Remember the little bytes in the chip:
                The code goes in and the graphics come out and nobody
                really knows how or why, but computers are all like that.
        15.     Pets and Lisas and DN350s and even the little bytes in the
                chip all die. So do we.
        16.     And then remember the Computer Reference Manuals and the
                first command you learned--the biggest command of all--Quit.
