<PRE>
	I heard this one on Paul Harvey's show on 3-23-91.

	Did you hear that they now have a mandatory seat-belt law in Texas,
with stiff fines for people caught without their belt buckled. Well, a guy
was driving his truck down the highway, when he saw the cop's flashing lights
behind him. He was being pulled over for speeding. But as he was slowing down,
he realized that his seat-belt was not on. So, he attempted to struggle with
the belt while he was pulling over, fumbling with the buckle, and finally
hooking it, just as he came to a stop.

	The officer walked up to his car and asked for his license. After 
looking it over, he turned to the man and said, "Well sir, you were going
20mph over the speed limit. And by the way, do you always drive with your
seat-belt threaded through the steering wheel?"
