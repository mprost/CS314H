A friend of mine (Ian Lipsky) just bounced this to me after it had been 
circling his workplace for a while.... 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Warning: Any resemblance between this fictional piece and a real person is 
most certainly accidental. 
<P>
*ring* *ring* 
<P>
"Hello! Local ISP, how can I help you?" 
<P>
"Well, I was sorta hoping someone could walk me through taking a leak" 
<P>
"Okay... well, do you have to go now?" 
<P>
"Yes, I do" 
<P>
"Okay... well, are you on male or female equipment?" 
<P>
"MALE-CLONE..." 
<P>
"Okay, the first thing we want to do is find your fly.." 
<P>
"My what?" 
<P>
"Your fly... it opens your pants. It should be in the front of you.   Look 
down" 
<P>
"I see shoes" 
<P>
"No, sir... look sorta in the front of you... like just below your 
stomach. You should see some metal on your pants. That's your fly.." 
<P>
"The round thing?" 
<P>
"Well, that's your button... let's open that, too, while we're down 
there. The fly looks like a lot of little metal things sideways" 
<P>
"Oh, okay.. got it.  &lt;pause&gt;  Okay, it's open.." 
<P>
"Okay, sir... can you grab your willy?" 
<P>
"No." 
<P>
"Do you see your willy?" 
<P>
"No." 
<P>
"Okay... what do you see?" 
<P>
"I see white... just white and some lines.." 
<P>
"Do you have underwear installed?" 
<P>
"No." 
<P>
"Sir, if you can't see your willy, and you see only white... I think that 
you may have underwear installed. We are going to have to uninstall your 
underwear to take a leak...." 
<P>
"Well, my friend was the last one to use my fly... he might have installed 
underwear..." 
<P>
"Okay, sir... well grab the white part and pull down... keep pulling until 
you see your willy.." 
<P>
"It's stuck... it won't go down..." 
<P>
"The white part? Or your willy?" 
<P>
"My willy..." 
<P>
"DON"T pull down on your willy, sir... just the underwear... we only want 
to get to the point where we can see it...." 
<P>
"Oh... okay, we're there...." 
<P>
"Okay... now look around the room... do you see anything made of porcelain?" 
<P>
"I see a little penguin on a shelf ..." 
<P>
"Okay, sir...you're in the living room.... go to the bathroom. We can't 
take a leak until we are in the bathroom. The bathroom will have a lot of 
tile, maybe some carpeting... yours might have mirrors or some soap in it. 
Some people have showers in their bathrooms..." 
<P>
"Well, I'm downstairs... I think the bathroom is upstairs..." 
<P>
"Okay, well... let's go upstairs..." 
<P>
"I can't walk..." 
<P>
"Okay, sir... temporarily reinstall your underwear... then go upstairs.. 
then uninstall your underwear again..." 
<P>
"That was the white part, right?" 
<P>
"Yes, sir... that's correct..." 
<P>
&lt;pause&gt; 
<P>
"Okay, I'm upstairs..." 
<P>
"Okay... now do you see any porcelain bowl-type things?" 
<P>
"Well, there's two..." 
<P>
"How tall are you sir?" 
<P>
"5'4" .." 
<P>
"Okay... go to the one where it's lower than your willy...." 
<P>
"Okay....I'm there" 
<P>
"Okay... now make sure that you are pointing toward the porcelain bowl.. 
now just go.... " 
<P>
"What do you mean?" 
<P>
"Well, when it pops up... just hit 'okay'....."
