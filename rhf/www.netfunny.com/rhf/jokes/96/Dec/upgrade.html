<PRE>Last year, my friend upgraded his GirlFriend3.1 to GirlFriendPlus1.0
(marketing name: Fiancee1.0). Recently he upgraded Fiancee1.0 to Wife1.0
and it's a memory hogger, it has taken all his space; and Wife1.0 must
be running before he can do anything. Although he did not ask for it,
Wife1.0 came with Plug-Ins such as MotherInLaw and BrotherInLaw.

Some features I'd like to see in the Upcomming GirlFriend4.0...

  - A "Don't remind me again" button
  
  - Minimize button
  
  - Shutdown feature
  
  - An install shield feature so that Girlfriend4.0 can be completely
  uninstalled if so desired (so you don't lose cache and other objects)
  
  I tried running girlfriend 2.0 with girlfriend 1.0 still installed, they
  tried using the same i/o port and conflicted.  Then I tried to unistall
  girlfriend 1.0 but it didn't have an uninstall program.  I tried to
  uninstall it by hand, but it put files in my system directory.  Another
  thing that sucks in all versions of girlfriend that I've used is that it
  is totally "object orientated" and only supported hardware with gold
  plated contacts.
  
  *****  BUG WARNING  ********
  
  Wife 1.0 has an undocumented bug. If you try to install Mistress 1.1
  before uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney files before
  doing the uninstall itself. Then Mistress 1.1 will refuse to install, 
  claiming insufficient resources.
