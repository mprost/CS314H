<PRE>My classmate, Susan, and I are in the middle of our thesis rewrites for Johns
Hopkins University.  We only have two weeks left and we are both quite razzled
at the prospect of doing more research in the remaining time.

Today Susan called me to say that she desperately needed more history about a
small tribe of Native Americans that lives in the Grand Canyon but there's 
only one telephone on the reservation and no one ever answers it.

As a matter of fact, the three times she visited the tribe's Visitor Center
while she was on vacation, she said no one ever opened up the building.

Being a computer geek, I said, "Have you checked the Internet?"

She said, "No, what a great idea!  Thanks."

I did a quick check using Excite while she used Yahoo and she was astounded at
the information available about this little-known tribe.  She thanked me
profusely for the tip and hung up.

Two hours later, she called me back sounding absolutely miserable.

"Susan," I said, "What's the matter?"

"Well," she said, "You're not going to believe it but they have their own Web
page with all the information I could ever want about the tribe."

"That's great," I said. "What more could you ask for?"

"You don't understand," she said. "My article is about how <b>isolated</b> the 
tribe is and how their only path to the outside world is a little dirt trail 
up the side of the canyon!  On their Web page, they even have a scanned photo 
of the helicopter that brought the donated PC into the canyon."

Moral of the story:  Sometimes ignorance is bliss--especially when you're
trying to finish a thesis on time.
