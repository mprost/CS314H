<PRE>Apparently, the following vacancy notice appeared on 11 Feb. 1996 in
Helsingin Sanomat, Finland's largest daily.  (Translation by me.
E-mailed to me by my cousin.)


&gt;  A TIRED AND BORING BUS COMPANY IS LOOKING FOR A LAZY AND SHIFTLESS
&gt;  PERSON FOR A POSITION WITHOUT ANY CHALLENGES WHATSOEVER.
&gt;
&gt;  Ita-Hameen Liikenne Oy [Eastern Hame Traffic Ltd.; Hame is a
&gt;  province] is hadquartered in Heinola, far in Eastern Hame.
&gt;  Alongside scheduled traffic, we try to rent buses for chartered
&gt;  trips.  We also own a few travel companies.  Since 1931, we've
&gt;  been attempting to offer our services on ever-contracting markets.
&gt;
&gt;  We could sell more.  If someone could be bothered to do the boring
&gt;  job of customer acquisition.  And it doesn't necessarily take any
&gt;  knowledge of the field.  It's just another job someone's got to do.
&gt;
&gt;  Sit down, get a cup of coffee, think slowly and carefully.  And if
&gt;  this still interests you, write an application and send it by February
&gt;  16 of this year, at the latest, to CEO Matti Jaaskelainen,
&gt;  Ita-Hameen Liikenne Oy, Mustanportinkatu 19, 18200 Heinola.  We
&gt;  can't be bothered to answer phone calls.  You might also mention
&gt;  your salary demand, if you please.  Write "lazy and shiftless" on
&gt;  the envelope.


The last I heard, Finland's unemployment rate was 18%, so I'm sure
they've found somebody by now.
