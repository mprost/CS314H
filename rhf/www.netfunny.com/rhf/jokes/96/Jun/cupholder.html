This was forwarded to me by my boss, who got it from a friend in Australia 
where it really happened... 
<P>
---- cut here ---- 
<P>
&gt;From:           lamaster@ziggy.econlab.Arizona.EDU (Shawn LaMaster) 
<P>
A friend of mine was on the phone with a tech rep from another company.  That 
tech rep called in to ask some questions about system setup, as the company 
this tech works for actually sells, installs and warranties systems.  While 
they were on the phone, this tech rep received an incoming call, which he took 
after.  When the caller hung up, the tech rep came back on the phone, laughing 
like a crazy person.  This is the call he took: 
<P>
Caller:        "Hello, is this Tech Support?" 
<P>
Tech Rep:      "Yes, it is.  How may I help you?" 
<P>
Caller:        "The cup holder on my PC is broken and I am within my 
warranty period.  How do I go about getting that fixed?" 
<P>
Tech Rep:      "I'm sorry, but did you say a cup holder?" 
<P>
Caller:        "Yes, it's attached to the front of my computer." 
<P>
Tech Rep:      "Please excuse me if I seem a bit stumped, it's because I 
am. Did you receive this as part of a promotional, at a 
trade show?  How did you get this cup holder?  Does it 
have any trademark on it?" 
<P>
Caller:        "It came with my computer, I don't know anything about a 
promotional.  It just has '4X' on it." 
<P>
At this point the Tech Rep had to mute the caller, because he couldn't stand 
it.  The caller had been using the load drawer of the CD-ROM drive as a cup 
holder, and snapped it off the drive.
