<PRE>This is my favorite "ethnic joke", that I have been telling for
years.  Yes, I know ethnic jokes are not "PC", but I'm desended
from all four nationalities mentioned, so I get away with it. ;&gt;


First, God created the Irish.  He said to himself, "These people
are fun.  They're very fun.  But I <b>don't</b> want them to <b>ever</b>
rule the world."  So to handicap them, He gave them Whisky.

Then God created the Scots.  He said to himself, "These people
are almost as much fun as the Irish.  But I don't want them to
ever the world, either."  So to handicap them, He gave them Kilts
and Bagpipes.

Then God created the Welsh.  He took one look at them, and said,
"No way!!".  So to handicap them, He gave them the Welsh
Language.

Finally, God created the English.  And for the smallest possible
moment in time, He was worried.  For he knew that these people
would come closer to ruling the world than any of the others.  So
he realized that he needed to give them a great handicap.  So He
gave them ... the Irish, Scots, and Welsh.
