<PRE>
Heard this on the radio this morning...

	Officers were dispatched to an Ohio college campus this week to
break up a fight involving two group of students, about 35 students
total were involved.

	A group of black students saw what they thought were members of a
white supremecist organization parading around the campus.  They took
offense and proceeded to yell at them, a fight followed.

	It turned out that they were members of a campus fraternity that
were going to a Halloween party dressed as the Pope and his entourage of
Cardinals...  

	That'll teach people not to wear "evil" costumes on Halloween...
