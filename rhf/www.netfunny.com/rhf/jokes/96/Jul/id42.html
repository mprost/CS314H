<PRE>CERT(sm) Advisory CA-96.13 
July 4, 1996 
</PRE><P>
</PRE>Topic: ID4 virus, Alien/OS Vulnerability 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The CERT Coordination Center has received reports of weaknesses in 
Alien/OS that can allow species with primitive information sciences 
technology to initiate denial-of-service attacks against MotherShip(tm) 
hosts.  One report of exploitation of this bug has been received. 
<P>
When attempting takeover of planets inhabited by such races, a trojan 
horse attack is possible that permits local access to the MotherShip 
host, enabling the implantation of executable code with full root access 
to mission-critical security features of the operating system. 
<P>
The vulnerability exists in versions of EvilAliens' Alien/OS 34762.12.1 
or later, and all versions of Microsoft's Windows/95.  CERT advises 
against initiating further planet takeover actions until patches 
are available from these vendors.  If planet takeover is absolutely 
necessary, CERT advises that affected sites apply the workarounds as 
specified below. 
<P>
As we receive additional information relating to this advisory, we will 
place it in 
<P>
ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-96.13.README 
<P>
We encourage you to check our README files regularly for updates on 
advisories that relate to your site. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
I.    Description 
<P>
Alien/OS contains a security vulnerability, which strangely enough 
can be exploited by a primitive race running Windows/95.  Although 
Alien/OS has been extensively field tested over millions of years by 
EvilAliens, Inc., the bug was only recently discovered during a 
routine invasion of a backwater planet.  EvilAliens notes that 
the operating system had never before been tested against a race 
with "such a kick-ass president." 
<P>
The vulnerability allows the insertion of executable code with 
root access to key security features of the operating system.  In 
particular, such code can disable the NiftyGreenShield (tm) 
subsystem, allowing child processes to be terminated by unauthorized 
users. 
<P>
Additionally, Alien/OS networking protocols can provide a 
low-bandwidth covert timing channel to a determined attacker. 
<P>
II.   Impact 
<P>
Non-privileged primitive users can cause the total destruction of 
your entire invasion fleet and gain unauthorized access to 
files. 
<P>
III.  Solution 
<P>
EvilAliens has supplied a workaround and a patch, as follows: 
<P>
A. Workaround 
<P>
To prevent unauthorized insertion of executables, install a 
firewall to selectively vaporize incoming packets that do not 
contain valid aliens.  Also, disable the "Java" option in 
Netscape. 
<P>
To eliminate the covert timing channel, remove untrusted 
hosts from routing tables.  As tempting as it is, do not use 
target species' own satellites against them. 
<P>
B. Patch 
<P>
As root, install the "evil" package from the distribution tape. 
<P>
(Optionally) save a copy of the existing /usr/bin/sendmail and 
modify its permission to prevent misuse. 
<P>
