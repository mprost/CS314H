<PRE>
A horse and a rabbit are playing in a meadow.  The horse falls into a mud   
hole and is sinking. He calls to the rabbit to go and get the farmer to   
help pull him out to safety.  The rabbit runs to the farm but the farmer   
can't be found. He drives the farmer's Mercedes back to the mud hole and   
ties some rope around the  bumper.  He then throws the other end of the   
rope to his friend, the horse, and drives the car forward saving him from   
sinking!

A few days later, the rabbit and horse were playing in the meadow again   
and the rabbit fell into the mud hole. The rabbit yelled to the horse to   
go and get some help from the farmer. The horse said, "I think I can   
stand over the hole!" So he stretched over the width of the hole and   
said, "Grab for my'thingy' and pull yourself up." And the rabbit did and   
pulled himself to safety.

The moral of the story: If you are hung like a horse, you don't need a   
Mercedes.
