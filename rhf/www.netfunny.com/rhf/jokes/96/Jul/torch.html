 I thought you would appreciate this, especially those of you that
had an opportunity to view this "historic" event ... Accordingly,
I thought you might like to see a minute-by-minute account of
what REALLY happened as the Torch made its way through our our
nation's capital:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

6:15  Torch arrives at city hall.  Crowd is dismayed when Marion
      Barry uses it to light his crack pipe.

      the torch to the country for "spiritual renewal".
6:30  Torch heads into Northwest Washington
6:35  Torch runner falls into D.C. pothole.
6:45  Torch is recovered (runner is never found).

      Howard.
7:01  David Falk stops the transaction, demanding $90 million over
      two years for Howard's effort.

      dropped into Potomac -- entire surface of river immediately
      ignites.
8:45  After being recovered by ValuJet divers, Torch enters
      Virginia. Upon crossing state line, runner is immediately
      assessed personal property tax on torch.
8:47  Runner attempts to hand torch to Virginia Senator John
      Warner. Warner refuses, saying he cannot, in good conscience,
      support this torch.

      in the D.C. area again
