Diary of an AOL User. 
<P>
July 18 - I just tried to connect to America Online. I've heard it is 
the best online service I can get.  They even included a free disk!  I'd 
better hold onto it incase they don't ever send me anther one!  I 
can't connect. I don't know what is wrong. 
<P>
July 19 - Some guy at the tech support center says my computer needs a 
modem. I don't see why. He's just trying to cheat me. How dumb does he 
think I am? 
<P>
July 22 - I bought the modem. I couldn't figure out where it goes. It 
wouldn't fit in the monitor or the printer. I'm confused. 
<P>
July 23 - I finally got the modem in and hooked up. that nine year old 
next door did it for me. But it still don't work. I cant get online. 
<P>
July 25 - That nine year old kid next door hooked me up to America 
Online for me. He's so smart. I told the kid he was a prodigy.  But he 
says that's just another service. What a modest kid.  He's so smart and 
he does these services for people.  Anyway he's smarter then the jerks 
who sold me the modem. They didn't even tell me about communications 
software. Bet they didn't know. And why do they put two telephone jack 
holes in the back of a modem when you only need one?  And why do they 
have one labeled phone when you are not suppose to hook it to the phone 
jack on the wall?  I thought the dial tone sounded funny! Boy, are modem 
makers dumb!  But the kid figured it out by the sound. 
<P>
July 26 - What's the internet?  I thought I was on America Online. Not 
this internet thing. I'm confused. 
<P>
July 27 - The nine year old kid next door showed me how to use this 
America Online stuff. I told him he must be a genius. He says that he is 
compared to me.  Maybe he's not so modest after all. 
<P>
July 28 - I tried to use chat today.  I tried to talk into my computer 
but nothing happened. maybe I need to buy a microphone. 
<P>
July 29 - I found this thing called usenet. I got out of it because I'm 
connected to America Online not usenet. 
<P>
July 30 - These people in this usenet thing keep using capital letters. 
How do they do that?  I never figured out how to type capital letters. 
Maybe they have a different type of keyboard. 
<P>
JULY 31 -  I CALLED THE COMPUTER MAKER I BOUGHT IT FROM TO COMPLAIN 
ABOUT NOT HAVING A CAPITOL LETTER KEY. THE TECH SUPPORT GUY SAID IT WAS 
THIS CAPS LOCK KEY.  WHY DIDN'T THEY SPELL IT OUT? I TOLD HIM I GOT A 
CHEAP KEYBOARD AND WANTED A BETTER ONE. AND ONE OF MY SHIFT KEYS ISNT 
THE SAME SIZE AS THE OTHER. HE SAID THATS A STANDARD. I TOLD HIM I 
DIDN'T WANT A STANDARD KEYBOARD BUT ANOTHER BRAND. I MUST HAVE HAD AN 
IMPORTANT COMPLAINT BECAUSE I HEARD HIM TELL THE OTHER SUPPORT GUYS 
TO LISTEN IN ON OUR CONVERSATION. 
<P>
AUGUST 1 - I FOUND THIS THING CALLED THE USENET ORACLE. IT SAYS THAT IT 
CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I ASK IT. I SENT IT 44 SEPARATE QUESTIONS ABOUT 
THE INTERNET. I HOPE IT RESPONDS SOON. 
<P>
AUGUST 2 - I FOUND A GROUP CALLED REC.HUMOR. I DECIDED TO POST THIS JOKE 
ABOUT THE CHICKEN THAT CROSSED THE ROAD. TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE! HA! 
HA! I WASNT SURE I POSTED IT RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 56 MORE TIMES. 
<P>
AUGUST 3 - I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE WORLD WIDE WEB. I DON'T NOW SPIDERS 
GREW THAT LARGE. 
<P>
AUGUST 4 - THE ORACLE RESPONDED TO MY QUESTIONS TODAY. GEEZ IT WAS RUDE. 
I WAS SO ANGRY THAT I POSTED AN ANGRY MESSAGE ABOUT IT TO 
REC.HUMOR.ORACLE. I WASNT SURE IF I POSTED RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 22 MORE 
TIMES. 
<P>
AUGUST 5 - SOMEONE TOLD ME TO READ THE FAQ. GEEZ THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO USE 
PROFANITY. 
<P>
AUGUST 6 - SOMEONE ELSE TOLD ME TO STOP SHOUTING IN ALL MY MESSAGES. 
WHAT A STUPID JERK. IM NOT SHOUTING! IM NOT EVEN TALKING! JUST TYPING! 
HOW CAN THEY LET THESE RUDE JERKS GO ON THE INTERNET? 
<P>
August 7 - Why have a Caps Lock key if you're not suppose to use it? Its 
probably an extra feature that costs more money. 
<P>
August 8 - I just read this post called make money fast. I'm so exited. 
I'm going to make lots of money. I followed his instructions and posted 
it to every newsgroup I could find. 
<P>
August 9 - I just made my signature file.  Its only 6 pages long. I will 
have to work on it some more. 
<P>
August 10 - I just looked at a group called alt.aol.sucks. I read a few 
posts and I really believe that aol should be wiped off the face of the 
earth. I wonder what an aol is. 
<P>
August 11 - I was asking where to find some information about something. 
Some guy told me to check out ftp.netcom.com. I've looked and looked 
but I can't find that group. 
<P>
August 12 - I sent a post to every usenet group on the Internet asking 
where the ftp.netcom.com is. hopefully someone will help. I cant ask the 
kid next door. His parents said that when he comes back from my house 
he's laughing so hard he can't eat or sleep or do his homework. So they 
wont let him come over anymore. I do have a great sense of humor. I 
don't know why the rec.humor group didn't like my chicken joke. Maybe 
they only like dirty stuff. Some people sent me posts about my 56 posts 
of the joke and they used bad words. 
<P>
August 13 - I sent another post to every usenet group on the Internet 
asking where the ftp.netcom.com is. I had forgot yesterday to include my 
new signature file which is only 8 pages long. I know everyone will want 
to read my favorite poem so I included it. I'm also going to add that 
short story I like. 
<P>
August 14 - Some guy suspended my account because of what I was doing. I 
told him I don't have an account at his bank. He's so dumb. 
<P>
