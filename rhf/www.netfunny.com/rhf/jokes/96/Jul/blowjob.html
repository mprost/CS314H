<PRE>
A man catching the last train home at night, accidentally fell asleep and 
missed his stop.  Upon waking at the end of the line in the small hours 
he tried to get a taxi home.  He only had $5 with him, and the only taxi 
there told him the fare would be $20.  The man offered to pay the 
difference when he got home, but the taxi driver wasn't having it.  The 
man spent the night sleeping rough, and planning his revenge.  

The next week the man caught the last train and deliberately stayed on until 
the last stop.  The same taxi was parked there, third in a queue.  The 
man approached the first taxi and asked how much a fare to his home would 
be.

"$20", was the reply.

The man said that he only had $5 on him, but he'd give the driver a 
blow-job as well.  The taxi driver swore at him and told him to leave him 
alone.  The man then went to the second taxi and did the same.  He got 
the same response.  He then went to the third taxi, the one that was there 
last time.  Again he asked how much the fare home would be.  "$20" was 
the reply.  "Okay" said the man, and got in.   As they pulled out past the 
first two taxis the man smiled and winked at the two drivers.
