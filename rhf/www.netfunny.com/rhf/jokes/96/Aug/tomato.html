<PRE>I was watching CNN International a while back and came across this funny 
story.

It was just at the end of "CNN World News" when Jonathan Mann, the 
anchor of the program, introduced a story about a farmer in New Zealand 
who had an interesting technique for growing his tomatoes.  He (the 
farmer) in fact uses bras to make sure the tomatoes grow just right.  
The farmer claimed that is the regular kind of bra that will help those 
tomatoes grow just the way they should.  No underwire will do, said he.

After the story was over the camera cut back to Jonathan sitting at his 
desk at the CNN Headquarters in Atlanta.  It was the end of the show and 
at this point Jonathan was to introduce the upcoming news program.  I 
don't remember what it was called, but I remember that the anchor for it  
was John Defterios.

So Jonathan looked into the camera, and with a straight face said, "Kind 
of makes you wonder how he grows his cucumbers.  And now to John 
Defterios in London to tell us what is coming up next.  John?"

John Defterios lost his cool, laughed out loud at first, and had a smile 
on his face through the whole introduction of his show.
