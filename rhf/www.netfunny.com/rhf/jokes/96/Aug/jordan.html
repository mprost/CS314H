<P>
Here's something that came to my husband with some other information. 
<P>
AND HERE IS SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT: 
<P>
Jordan will make over $300,000 a game, $10,000 a minute assuming he 
averages about 30 minutes a game. 
<P>
Assuming $40 mil in endorsements next year, he'll be making $178,100 a day 
(working or not)! 
<P>
Assuming he sleeps 7 hours a night, he makes $52,000 every night while 
visions of sugarplums dance in his head. 
<P>
If he goes to see Independence Day, it'll cost him $7.00, but he'll make 
$18,550 while he's there. 
<P>
If he decides to have a 5 minute egg, he'll make $618 while boiling it. 
<P>
He makes $7,415/hr more than minimum wage (after the wage hike) 
<P>
He'll make $3,710 while watching each episode of Seinfeld. 
<P>
If he wanted to save up for a new Acura NSX ($90,000) it would take him a 
whole 12 days. 
<P>
If someone were to hand him his salary and endorsement money, they would 
have to do it at the rate of $2.00 every second. 
<P>
He'll probably pay around $200 for a nice round of golf, but will be 
'reimbursed' $33,390 for that round. 
<P>
He could take 1/100,000th of his income and buy some poor college student 
5200 packages of Ramen. 
<P>
Assuming he puts the federal maximum of 15% of his income into his tax 
deferred account (401k), he will hit the federal cap of $9500 for such 
accounts at 8:30 a.m. on January 1st, 1997. 
<P>
If you were given a tenth of a penny for every dollar he made, you'd be 
living comfortably at $65,000 a year. 
<P>
He'll make about $15,600 while the Boston Marathon is being run, 
<P>
While the common person is spending about $20 for a meal in his trendy 
Chicago restaurant, he'll pull in about $5600. 
<P>
Next year, he'll make more than twice as much as all of our past 
presidents for all of their terms combined. 
<P>
And something to cheer you up after all of this...  Jordan will only have 
to have this income for 270 more years to have a net worth equivalent to 
that of Bill Gates. 
<P>
