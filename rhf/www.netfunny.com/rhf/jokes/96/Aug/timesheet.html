It has come to my attention recently that many people have been turning 
in timesheets that specify large amounts of "Miscellaneous Unproductive 
Time" (code 5300).  To our department, unproductive time isn't a problem. 
<P>
What is a problem is not knowing exactly what people are doing during 
their unproductive time. 
<P>
I've attached a sheet specifying a tentative extended job list based on 
my observations of employee activities. The list will allow you to specify 
with a fair amount of precision what you are doing during your unproductive 
time. Please distribute this as necessary, and let me know about any 
difficulties. 
<P>
For your timesheets:
