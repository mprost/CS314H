<PRE>Guys,
     A real excerpt from the 4 August 1996 church bulletin.  Hope you all
enjoy it!

NO EXCUSE SUNDAY
__________________

To make it possible  for everyone to attend church next Sunday we are going
to have a special "No Excuse Sunday".   

Cots will be placed in the foyer for those who say "Sunday is my only day to
sleep in".  We  will have steel helmets for those who think the church is
too cold, and fans for those who say it is too hot.   We will have hearing
aids for those who say "The Priest talks too softly", and cotton for those
who say HE preaches too loudly.   Score cards for those who wish to list
hypocrites present.   Some relatives will be in attendance for those who
like to go visiting on Sundays.  There will be TV dinners for those who
can't go to Church and cook dinner also.  One section will be devoted to
trees and grass for those who like to see God in Nature.  Finally the
Sancuary will be decorated with both Christmas pointsettias and Easter
Lillies for those who have never seen the church without them.
