<PRE>
The boyfriend of a coworker is a grad student at Harvard.  She just sent 
this message around the office:

Yet again, truth is stranger as fiction (or at least as ironic)...

Harvard had bomb scare one the first day of classes on Monday.  An orange 
crate was found ticking on one of the loading docks.

They got the experts in, x-rayed it, listened to it, smelled it... they 
just couldn't figure out what it was.  The x-ray sure enough revealed some 
wires and other strange-looking items in the crate.  When they just 
couldn't figure out what it was, they decided to isolate the package and 
detonate it.

Once they blew it apart, they saw right away what it was...  The crate 
turned out to be a care package for a new student, with a metronome that 
had turned on by itself!  All the contents, of course, were destroyed, 
including pictures of his girlfriend.

Imagine the school officials handing over a pile of rubble to the student, 
saying, "Oh, by the way, Mr. Smith, your care package arrived."  What a way 
to start college!

I wonder if it ever occured to them to ask the person to whom it was 
addressed...
