<PRE>
With the preliminary hearing over, people can go back to their soap 
operas or actually showing up at their day jobs.  In the meantime,
we're still getting submissions.

If you're not interested in American ex-football players with multiple
murder charges, well, too bad.

Knock, knock.
Who's there?
OJ.
OJ who?
Congratulations!  You're on the jury!

From: ST1DG@jetson.uh.edu

heard this at work today:
what is the last thing OJ said to Nicole before he killed her?
"The waiter will be with you shortly."

--------------------------------------------------------------------
From: mjk@sonata.cc.purdue.edu (Michael Klopfenstein)

Heard on Q95 in Indianapolis:

What's the difference between OJ Simpson and Jeffry Dommer?

OJ only ate one of his victims.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: OJ: has it come to this?
From: dand@usa.net (Dan D)

Headliner in the Black Forest News, a Colorado Springs local paper:

THERE IS NO O.J. SIMPSON COVERAGE IN THIS NEWSPAPER!

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: OJ and the World Cup
From: nwarmenh@reed.edu (Nic Warmenhoven)

My father wrote this one:

What amazes me about OJ's pre-trial hearing was that the defense NEVER 
mentioned that both Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman scored own goals 
against Colombia! I mean, you'd think...

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: OJ: Dueling tabloids
From: DanielC930@aol.com

Original:

I saw at the supermarket tonight that the GLOBE says that OJ didn't do it.
 Right next to it, the WEEKLY WORLD NEWS says he did.

I just don't know who to believe any more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: OJ's latest alibi
From: pd411x@unix1.circ.gwu.edu (P.J. Geraghty)

Seems OJ will finally beat the rap, as he has an airtight alibi...

\...He was in a Denny's waiting to be served...

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CNN Coverage of Comet
From: rutkows@cc.umanitoba.ca

CNN has had great coverage of Comet Shoemaker/Levy's impact on Jupiter
\.. ever since astronomers announced that the comet was actually a
white Ford Bronco, the camera crews have been up in helicopters looking
for it!

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: R. Goldman and N. Simpson
From: simpson@raistlin.tfs.com (Scott Simpson)

What did Ronald Goldman say to Nicole Simpson in heaven?

Here's your f*cking glasses!
