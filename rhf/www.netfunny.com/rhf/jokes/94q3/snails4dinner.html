<PRE>This joke was told to me by a friend who's staying over in Italy, Bekah Lepro.


A wife and her husband were having a dinner party for all the major status
figures in Rome, Italy. The wife was very excited about this and wanted
everything to be perfect. At the very last minute, she realized that she
didn't have any snails for this dinner party, so she asked her husband to 
run down to the beach with the bucket she was handing him to gather some 
snails.

Very grudgingly he agreed. He took the bucket, walked out the door, down the
steps, and out to the beach. As he was collecting the snails, he noticed a
beautiful woman strolling alongside the water just a little further down the
beach. He kept thinking to himself "Wouldn't it be great if she would even
just come down and <i>talk</i> to me." He went back to gathering the snails. All of
a sudden he looked up, and the beautiful woman was standing right over him.
They got to talking, and she invited him back to her place.

They were at her apartment a ways down the beach, and they started messing
around. It got so hot and heavy, that he was exhausted afterwards and passed
out there. At seven o'clock the next morning he woke up and exclaimed, "Oh
no!!! My wife's dinner party!!!" He gathered all his clothes, put them on
real fast, grabbed his bucket, and ran out the door. He ran down the beach all
the way to his apartment.

He ran up the stairs of his apartment. He was in such a hurry that when he got
to the top of the stairs, he <i>dropped</i> the bucket of snails. There were snails
all down the stairs. The door opened just then, with a very angry wife standing
in the door way wondering where he's been all this time. He looked at the snails
all down the steps, then he looked at her, then back at the snails and said:


"Come on guys, we're almost there!"
