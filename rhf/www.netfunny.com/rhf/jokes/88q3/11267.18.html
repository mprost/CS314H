<FONT size=+2>HORIZONS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY</FONT><BR>
By Ross Williams 3 June 1988.<BR>
</center>
<P>
Recent studies have shown that while undergraduate students are more intelligent 
than kindergarten students,  the mentality and attention span of  the two groups 
are similar. With this  in mind, we introduce a new  concept in Computer Science 
education:

Kermit: This  is Kermit  the Frog reporting  for Sesame  Street news.  Today, we 
interview  Professor  Biskit who  works  on  cookie biosearch.  Hello  Professor 
Biskit, what have you got there? 
<P>
Prof: Arcchhh, I am trying to find out iv there is zarch a sing as an infinitely 
long  coorkie. Dis  machine vill  produce every  sort of  coorkie possible:  big 
cookies, dittle cookies, square cookies, round cookies. The cookies come out dis 
hole here. 
<P>
Kermit: You mean if  you get a really long cookie, it will  come out of the hole 
like a sausage? 
<P>
Prof: Yaaaass, that's right.  Now I vill set de machine going,  and ve can start 
vatching de corkies. 
<P>
GRRRRUNNNCCHHHH CHUGGA CHUGGA CHUGGA CHUGGA... 
<P>
Prof: Aass here comes one,... CLUNK 
<P>
Cookie Monster: Cooooookie! Chomp. 
<P>
Prof: Und another. Dis one eees square: CLUNK. 
<P>
Kermit: Uh professor... 
<P>
Prof: Don't bother me now, I'm vatchin coorkies. 
<P>
Kermit: What if there isn't an infinitely long cookie? 
<P>
Prof: Then  they vill come out  of dis machine  forever - there are  an infinite 
number of possible corkies you know. 
<P>
Kermit: And what if the machine starts making an infinitely long cookie? 
<P>
Prof: Thats obvious you frogk, I vill have to vait for it to come out. 
<P>
Kermit: And how long will that take? 
<P>
Prof: Forever. 
<P>
Kermit: So if  there isn't an infinitely  long cookie, you have  to wait forever 
and if there is, you have to wait forever  too. How are you going to find out if 
there is an infinitely long cookie today? 
<P>
Prof: Don't interrupt. Here comes a triangular one viff purple spots. 
<P>
Cookie monster: CRUNCH. GULP. 
<P>
Prof: My machine! 
<P>
Kermit: Well, it looks as if the  cookie monster has transcended the question of 
whether there is an infinitely long cookie  by eating the cookie machine. A good 
thing as the computation was UNCOMPUTABLE.

Narrator: Hello Big Bird. What's all this mess? 
<P>
Big Bird:  I'm planting a binary  tree. That way, I  can nest in it  and I won't 
have to fly South for the winter. 
<P>
Narrator: How long will it take for the tree to grow tall enough? 
<P>
Big Bird: If I add branches randomly it will take me log_2(t)/1.386. 
<P>
Narrator: Tell me why, Big Bird?

Neil: Ow, WOW heavy! My lentil binary trees are growing exponentially. 
<P>
Vivian: This calls for a subtle combination of mathematics and extreme violence. 
<P>
Rick: Oh you couldn't theorize even if you picked your nose with a silicon chip. 
<P>
Vivian: OK, watch! This is how you dismantle a binary tree in constant time... 
<P>
CRUNCH, CHOP, CRASH... 
<P>
Neil: WOW. Heavy. Look at the mess. Look at all the garbage! 
<P>
Garbage: Now they'll try to clean me  up in constant time, but they've forgotten 
about all those cycles caused by curly lentils... 
<P>
Vivian: Oh no we  didn't because I cut all the cycles before  I chopped down the 
tree... 
<P>
Rick: You  can't do that in  linear time! What  sort of a snotty  nosed gullible 
girlie do you think I am? 
<P>
Vivian: Well I had him fooled! 
<P>
Neil:  No  you  didn't!  I  was  just waiting  for  the  tree  to  spontaneously 
re-assemble.
