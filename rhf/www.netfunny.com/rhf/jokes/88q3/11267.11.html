<CENTER>GURKHAS - THE MARTIAL RACE</CENTER><BR>
<P>
Now that an accord has been signed between the GNLF of 
Subhash ( not the go back to India one :-)) Ghising and the 
Government of India, it might be appropriate to recollect 
an interesting anecdote regarding these doughty warriors. 
<P>
In World war II, an English reporter who had heard so much 
about the bravery and elan of the Gurkhas visited a camp just 
in front of the enemy lines (Germans).  During the course of 
his reporting, he had occasion to observe a mission being 
conducted. 
<P>
The mission was to airdrop a bunch of soldiers behind 
enemy lines to conduct some relatively light action.  He watched 
the commander of the Gurkhas (a British soldier) pitch 
the mission and then ask for volunteers.  To his surprise, 
only about half the Gurkhas volunteered and were sent off. 
<P>
Throughly disillusioned with the legends of Gurkha bravery, 
the reporter went back home.  After the war, he happened to 
run into a Gurkha who had been there, and asked him why 
half the troops had failed to volunteer.  It turned 
out that none of the squad, both those who volunteered and those 
who did not, were aware that they would get a parachute for the drop. 
Hence the low turnout.
