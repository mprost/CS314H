<STRONG>[Ed: This is a collection of the better shuttle jokes, presented long after the 
tragedy.  You may well have heard of these.  There are more, but I'm not 
posting them.  As usual, do not send any extras to me, and since the 
submitter asked to be anonymous, you can't send to him either. ]</STRONG>
