I was recently (as in yesterday) given this announcement for 
a new C compiler.  Please do not direct any questions concerning 
this product to me - all I know is what you see here.  Please 
contact the company for further information.  Also, this is long, 
so please edit accordingly when replying via news.

<H4>Tenne-C Announcement</H4>
<P>
<CENTER>Tenne-C programming language</CENTER><BR>
<P>
<CENTER>from Good Ol' Boy Systems.</CENTER><BR>
<P>
NOTE: The following is rated PG; programmer's guidance should be exercised. 
<P>
For all those unfamiliar with Tenne-C, the comment delimiter is WHISPER.  The 
computer stores all WHISPERed comments in memory, but the instruction execution 
unit can never quite decode them, so they are ignored.  Some beta site users 
have reported an occasional problem with IBM clone machines.  These machines 
may get slightly confused or mildly paranoid due to the whispered remarks in 
the background, but the effects are usually limited to an occasional mutterance 
printed on the display.  Note that the optional extended obcenity instruction 
set should not be installed in clone machines.  Should such a machine crash, 
you could be arrested for making an obscene clone fall. 
<P>
<H4>General Idiosyncrasies of Tenne-C</H4>
<P>
Data is referred to as Ciphers; the start of a data section should be so 
labeled.  Data which is external to a given file is denoted  by the term 
YONDER, similar to the EXTERNAL directive. 
<P>
Single arguments are not passed to functions individually; rather, multiple 
passes are made simultaneously to all functions.  Thus, in Tenne-C, we speak of 
feuds rather than arguments.  This is an extremely powerful, albeit somewhat 
destructive feature of Tenne-C. 
<P>
Relational operators work similarly to those in other languages, but in Tenne-C 
these are called kinfolk operators.  It will be noted that some of these 
interrelate better than others.  Kinfolk operators include: 
<P>
<!--  table width=2,3 lines=all-->
<!-- TABLE--><PRE>
        Bettern                 (mines) bettern (yourn) 
        Boutlack                (mines) boutlack (yourn) 
        Nearlyboutlack          (mines) nearlyboutlack (yourn) 
        Worsern                 (yourns) worsern (mine) 
        Nearlyboutsgoods        (yourns) nearlyboutsgoods (mine) 
        Lack                    (mines) lack (yourn) 
        Sortalack               (mines) sortalack (yourn) 
        Differrtn               (yourns) differrtn (mine) 
</PRE>
<P>
The Boolean operators are somewhat different than most.  Note the lack of AND 
and OR operators: 
<P>
<!--  m-->
<PRE>        taint 
        istoo 
        tis 
        aintdunnit 
        nary 
        nope 
</PRE>
<P>
Variable assignments must be explicitly declared with the AHDODECLARE 
directive, although one declaration can serve a block of variables.  Variable 
assignments can be quite interesting and flexible, as can be seen in the 
following examples: 
<P>
<!--  m-->
<PRE>ahdodeclare:  a's     nearlybout      3 
              b's     zacktly         4 
              c's     bout            2 
              d's     morerless       TWEV 
              e's     2, an imeanit   WHISPER a constant 
</PRE>
<P>
Certain constants are implicit, such as SCOSHE, LIBBIT, FAV, SEM, NAN, LEM, 
TWEV, THUTTY, etc.  Such obvious values need not be declared, as they reside in 
the liberry books. 
<P>
Arrays must be declared with the AHDODECLARE statement, and are referred to as 
messa, as in: 
<P>
<!--  m-->
<PRE>        Ahdodeclare(dinner)     messa(fish)     TWEV 
</PRE>
<P>
Note that until you get the hang of array declarations, you may encounter a 
SYNTEXT ERROR; this is a syntax error which has been taken out of context. 
<P>
The program section is referred to as CHORES and is labeled as such.  Several 
loop and conditional constructs are available. These include the following: 
<P>
<!--  m-->
<PRE>        Hauloff and do 
        Fer, til loop 
        Whol, longasyerattit 
        Iffen, theyen 
        Yehbut, nowait 
</PRE>
<P>
Code is grouped into hopefully functional units with the standard, [] and () 
operators, although they are given slightly different names.  They are still 
called braces, but the [] are called kibbuls and the () are called bits.  Thus, 
you can have braces and bits or kibbuls and bits.  Braces and kibbuls are, of 
course, meaningless. 
<P>
If a KIBBITZ ERROR is encountered at compile time, that is a single kib [ with 
a pair of bits ().  The ommision of a single ] can also result in a NO BULL! 
error.  Very serious compiler errors will be preceeded by the SELF message. 
That's right, brace yourself.  We're talking about such errors as SOURCE FILE 
TURNED TO TRASH, SOURCE FILE CONVERTED TO RUN FILE, HEX PUT ON SOURCE FILE, 
that sort of thing.  Errors of this type will be followed by the message "START 
ALL OVER FROM SCRATCH," and the offending source file will, of course, be 
deleted. 
<P>
Error messages can be quite strong indeed.  We have one of the most arrogant 
compilers in the business, a source of great pride for us.  Typical error 
messages include: 
<P>
<PRE>        WELL, IF THAT AIN'T ABOUT THE DUMBEST DANG THANG 
	  I EVER SEEN! 
        WHADJA DO THAT FER? 
        ERROR TWENNY SEM, DUMB AICE! 
        DAMMIT, BOY, HOW MANY TIMES I GOT TO TELL YOU?! 
</PRE><P>
</PRE>The compiler is referred to as the THRASHER and is invoked with the simple 
THRASH directive.  BE SURE NOT TO OMIT THE "H" FROM THIS COMMAND!!!  If you are 
unsure whether you want to compile the entire program, you may use the more 
general THRASH AROUND command. 
<P>
Good Ol' Boy Systems still clings tenaciously to the notion that single-sided 
diskettes are better than double-sided diskettes.  We maintain that a 
single-sided diskette is in opposition to the laws of physics as we know them 
today.  However, we further maintain that, at some time in the future, Good Ol' 
Boy Systems will be the first to discover the unlimited storage of the 
heretofore undiscovered "nether side" of single-sided diskettes.  Now THAT, 
folks, is virtual disk space. 
<P>
A software linker is not yet available.  Until the virtual disk space is truly 
solved, we strongly recommend double sided disk drives.  You can then purchase 
our hardware linker, which allows you to superglue two single-sided diskettes 
together. 
<P>
We're working on other things, too.  For instance, there's our new operating 
system, MS-HOSS, with the 'Mater Vine file structure.  And for 'Mater Vine 
support, there's 'Mater Stakes.  And if you thought SideKick was good, wait til 
you see our new ButtKick utility.  Expected to be widely available by the end 
of next month, regardless of what month this be, it is being developed using 
our powerful new Four Barrel Tenne-C.  While we aren't yet ready to develop a 
Turbo Tenne-C, we feel that the high data compression ratio of Four Barrel 
Tenne-C will suffice. 
<P>
Here is a sample of our work.  This is part of our new floating point package, 
written in LOWLIFE, our low-level programming language.
