<STRONG>[Ed: Well, pretty contrived, but... ]</STRONG> 
<P>
The year is 1996.  By this time, the American Government's policy of 
Social Welfare has been extended to require that any married couple who 
has not had a child within the first five years of marriage, must 
receive the services of a government man who will attempt to be the means 
of the wife becoming a mother. 
<P>
There are no children in the family of this particular story: much to the 
sorrow of the husband, and it is the morning of their fifth wedding 
anniversary. 
<P>
Husband - Well, goodbye, dear, I'm off to the office.  I suppose the 
government man will be here shortly, computer-printed address and all. 
<P>
He leaves with his head bowed.  The wife pretties herself and powders her 
nose just as the doorbell rings.  She is expecting the government man, but 
instead her caller is a baby photographer who has come to see if he could 
interest her in some baby pictures.  The following conversation ensues: 
<P>
Lady:  Oh, Good Morning. 
<P>
Man:   How do you do?  You probably don't know me, but I represent---- 
<P>
Lady:  You needn't explain, Mr.---- 
<P>
Man:   Jones is the name, Madame, and I make a specialty of---- 
<P>
Lady:  Yes, of course, I know.  It's all right.  Won't you come in? 
<P>
Man:   Your husband probably told you that---- 
<P>
Lady:  Oh, yes, and we both agreed that it is the best thing to do. 
<P>
Man:   Well, in that case I might as well get busy. 
<P>
Lady:  I'm not too familiar with the way you do this.  Just where do we start? 
<P>
Man:   Just leave it to me, Madame.  I recommend two in the bathtub, one or 
two more on the couch, and a couple on the floor. 
<P>
Lady:  Bathtub?  Couch?  Floor?  Good heavens. 
<P>
Man:   Well, my dear lady,  even the best of us can't get a good one 
every time, but out of six, one is bound to be a honey.  I usually 
have the best luck with the bathtub shots. 
<P>
Lady:  You'll have to forgive me, but it does seem a little informal. 
<P>
Man:   The charm of the whole thing is the informality.  Perhaps you 
would like to see some of my work? 
<P>
Lady:  Well, I suppose so ----, after all, there is no hurry, is there? 
<P>
Man:   No, indeed, a man in my line can't do his best work in a hurry. 
(He opens his album and shows her.)  Look at this baby.  It's a good 
job.  Took four hours, but isn't it a beauty? 
<P>
Lady:  Yes, indeed a lovely child. 
<P>
Man:   But for a tough assignment, look at this job.  Believe it or not, 
it was done on top of a bus on Fifth Avenue. 
<P>
Lady:  My God. 
<P>
Man:   Well, there a little story behind that.  The mother of the child was 
a movie actress in need of a little publicity, and did she get it. 
<P>
Lady:  I should think so. 
<P>
Man:   Here is the picture of the handsomest of twins in town.  I knocked 
that out in Central Park on a snowy afternoon last winter.  It took 
me from two in the afternoon 'til five.  I never worked under more 
difficult conditions, with people four or five deep, crowding to 
take a look. 
<P>
Lady:  Four or five deep? 
<P>
Man:   Yes people everywhere.  Just imagine working more than three hours 
under handicaps like that.  I even had two cops helping me.  I could 
have gotten anther quick shot or two before dark, but by that time 
the squirrels were nibbling on my equipment and I had to give up.  Well, 
Madame, if you are ready, I'll set up my tripod and we'll get started. 
<P>
Lady:  Your tripod? 
<P>
Man:   Yes, I always use a tripod to rest my equipment on, as it's too heavy 
for me to hold for any length of time, and - Good heavens, she 
fainted.........
