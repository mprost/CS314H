<CENTER>A Dumb-Mathetician Joke</CENTER><BR>
<P>
There was a mad scientist (a mad SOCIAL scientist) who kidnapped three 
colleagues, an engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician, and locked each of 
them in separate cells with plenty of canned food and water but no can opener. 
<P>
A month later, returning, the mad scientist went to the engineer's cell 
and found it long empty. The engineer had constructed a can opener from pocket 
trash, used aluminum shavings and dried sugar to make an explosive,and escaped. 
<P>
The physicist had worked out the angle necessary to knock the lids off the 
tin cans by throwing them against the wall.  She was developing a good pitching 
arm and a new quantum theory. 
<P>
The mathematician had stacked the unopened cans into a surprising solution to 
the kissing problem;   his desicated corpse was propped calmly against a wall, 
and this was inscribed on the floor in blood: 
<P>
<PRE>	         THEOREM: If I can't open these cans, I'll die. 
	         PROOF:  Assume the opposite ... 
<P>
</PRE>
