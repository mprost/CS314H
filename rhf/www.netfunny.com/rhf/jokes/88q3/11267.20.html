The Preying Mantis Syndrome 
<P>
Many lower life forms demonstrate qualities that, at first, don't seem 
very good for survival.  For instance, the female praying mantis, after mating 
with, well, her mate, will devour him.  For the male praying mantis, however, 
it is a catch-22.  If he mates, he gets screwed out of an opportunity to mate 
again.  If he doesn't mate, he doesn't reproduce and that is the end of his 
family tree (not that all insects live in trees, mind you).  This suicidal 
behavior is commonly called the Preying Mantis Syndrome - and many life forms 
are periodically subject to it's wrath.  How did the preying mantis become 
stuck in such a vicious cycle?  This is probably what happened beforehand: 
<P>
The male mantis arrives at the residence of the female mantis.  After some 
courtship exercises (dinner, a movie, inserting the diaphragm) they mate.  The 
female mantis, her lust for...lust being satisfied relaxes while the Male raids 
the refrigerator and returns home.  This behavior continues until the male and 
female (mantissas?) establish a permanent relationship.  Then the male 
establishes a new pattern of behavior:  Football on Mondays, baseball on 
Tuesdays, happy hour on Wednesdays, Uh, working-late-at-the-office on Thursdays, 
and bowling on Fridays.  The female tolerates this to a certain extent, then 
files for a divorce.  After a long battle, she retires to her alimony-paid 
home with a lesson well learned:  It simplifies matters tremendously to just 
eat him when you're done with him. 
<P>
Well, through the process of evolution, the Preying Mantis Syndrome is 
carried up into the highest life forms, even humans.  That is why, one week 
out of every month, the female of the species will feel compelled to bite the 
head off the male.  The Preying Mantis Syndrome is inescapable, but when it 
occurs in the female of our species, it's best to just avoid them for a while.
