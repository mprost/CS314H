<PRE>Some years ago (my third year of high school, I believe), I created a new 
religion following a caffeine revelation.  This part is not EXCEPTIONALLY 
funny, but it serves as a background to a (hopefully) more humorous story I 
wrote later which is based on this religion.  The story will be posted 
following this one.

            whose true faith gave me food for thought 
<P>
			INTRODUCTION 
<P>
     In  this  world there exist hundreds of distinct  religions,  
each (with a few exceptions) knowing beyond a shred of doubt that  
it  is  correct and that everyone else is...well,  WRONG.  One of  
the  few  beliefs  that  does  not hold  this  view  is  that  of  
agnosticism, whose hazy guidelines show either open-mindedness or  
indecision,  depending upon the individual. Most others adhere to  
this general closed-minded principle, often causing  disharmonies  
between those of conflicting religious faiths. 
     Thus we now find a need for a blanket policy to unite all of  
these beliefs under one roof, while simultaneously not infringing  
upon or doubting the validity of any of them.  It must follow the  
definition  of  etiquette:  not  to offend anyone.  With  such  a  
policy,  the  emphasis lies in  tolerance.  Widespread  religious  
tolerance  would eventually lead to the destruction of  religious  
discrimination,  a  sword which hangs over our necks wherever  we  
go. 
     Omnideism is not a religion unto itself; it instead attempts  
to  explain  the absolutism and co-existence of other  religions,  
beliefs,  and what have you.  Placing all faiths at equal levels,  
Omnideism serves as the United Nations of theism. 
 
                OMNIDEISM: A STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW 
<P>
     Let  us say that all religions do exist,  and that all  have  
the same measure of validity and truth with respect to...x? No...  
this is philosophy,  not calculus! ...with respect to the supreme  
being(s) found in each one (Hence,  "Omnideism"). Let us then say  
that  these  beings know of each other's existence,  but  do  not  
interfere with the religious activities below.  (On  Earth,  that  
is. I envision omnipotent entities as being "out there.") In this  
manner,  monotheists  know only their one god,  while polytheists  
know  only  of  their own pantheon.  This  can  account  for  the  
singularity  and closed-mindedness of all religions.  One of  the  
Ten  Commandments states,  "Thou shalt have no other gods  before  
me" (or something to that effect).  A  subliminal hint,  perhaps, 
that  the Christian God knows of these others?  Omnideism strikes 
again.... 
     Each of us is born destined to find one of these eventually,  
or  in  the  case of atheists or agnostics,  not  to.  Only  this  
particular deity is keyed to our soul,  so we can know no  other.  
What about the Born-again Christians?  Well, these are people who  
were  destined  not to find God until a later time,  but  it  was  
planned  all the same.  The process of selection for each god  or  
pantheon may be some organized thing like drawing lots, or it may  
be  random  chance.  We think that we or our parents  decide  our  
religion or lack thereof,  but it is actually all controlled from  
above. 
     Okay,  but  what about the atheists?  Well,  there are three  
possibilites for this one:  accidently overlooked,  intentionally  
overlooked,  or  controlled.  The first theory simply  says  that  
somebody forgot to register the atheists, and their lots were not  
drawn or numbers randomly discovered.  The second theory suggests  
that it was decided that they should be free of religion, as part  
of a test or perhaps just because.  The test would be to find out  
what  the lack of a supreme being would have on a person's  life.  
The  third  theory  says that there is a  being  controlling  the  
atheists, but does not want to make him/herself known. This could  
account for what we call "luck" and "coincidence." 
     Now,  what about agnostics? Well, agnostics are here to stir  
up  trouble and think up ridiculous theories about the  universe.  
After all,  an agnostic "discovered" Omnideism, right? All right,  
then....  They are  also here to make  life  interesting.  Arthur  
Clarke,  a prestigious science-fiction writer,  proposed the same  
thing:  paradise  in  the form of a self-sufficient  city,  where  
every  few  hundred years a man is "born" who  is  different  and  
usually stirs up trouble.  After all,  if paradise is boring,  it  
isn't  paradise anymore.  This is the religious role of agnostics  
in today's society (although it as about as far from paradise  as  
possible). 
 
                           CONCLUSION 
<P>
     That,  then,  is  the bare bones of Omnideism.  Now that you  
know,  tell all your friends and the world will be a much  better  
place.  No  more religious discrimination or one-sided  religious  
arguments. Paradise, here we come...

Here, then, is the story that I wrote a year later.  It's undergoing a major 
revision right now, but will probably never be finished.  Hope you like it. 
 
                      FURNITURE OF THE GODS 
                             
                    		by  Tom Newcomb 
<P>
     My  world suddenly narrowed down to her,  and the pistol she  
held so confidently in her hand.  Mercy had no part in  her;  she  
fired once,  twice.... 
     The  last  thing I saw of the world was my body sprawled  in  
the dirt.  The scene changed,  and I found myself waiting in line  
in a spotless white room that seemed to go on forever.  The  line  
moved  slowly,  and  after  four days I finally saw where  I  was  
going.  It ended at a large booth set into the wall.  Behind  the  
booth  sat  a  small man wearing a pair of  mylar  sunglasses,  a  
rubber nose,  and nothing else.  As each person walked up to him,  
he would point to either his right or his left,  and an attendant  
appeared from that side to escort the person to his destination.  
    I began to wonder,  where would I end up?  I was a good  boy,  
even though I was an agnostic. Who knows. 
     When I finally reached the booth,  the man looked at me. His  
rubber nose fell off. "It's you!" he exclaimed. 
     A quick look into a nearby mirror confirmed this. 
     He went on. "You discovered Omnideism, didn't you?" 
     I  replied that I had thought up that ridiculous theory  one  
evening when I had nothing better to do. 
     "But  my boy!" he said excitedly,  "You've realized the Sys- 
tem!  And because you are the only human in all history to do so,  
we have planned a special tour for you!  We are going to give you  
an inside look at our little operation up here.  Congratulations,  
my boy!" He turned around and screeched, "JOE!" 
     A tall man in a leather jacket and neon green spandex  pants  
walked out of the wall and said, "Yeah? Whaddya want?" 
     "This  is  the  boy they told you about." He turned  to  me,  
saying,  "Joe will be your tour guide.  No  smoking,  eating,  or  
drinking, and please no flash pictures." 
     I looked at Joe critically, commenting, "You don't look like  
a divine being to me." 
     "Yeah? Well, you don't look so divine yourself. Now come on,  
let's get this over with. I'm missing `Miami Vice'." 
     The  white  room  disappeared,  to  be replaced  by  a  long  
corridor that seemed to be a different color every time I  looked  
at  it.  There were doors at regular intervals along both  walls,  
each with writing on it. 
     We approached the first door.  "Religion Room," it read. Joe  
opened  the  door and I saw a large room,  occupied for the  most  
part  by  a huge...a huge...~fishbowl~ filled  with  millions  of 
little red capsules.  A LCD display on the wall flashed the names 
of different religions, and as each would come up, a fat man in a  
blue  leisure suit and swimming goggles would pull out one of the  
capsules and read off the name.  The sign read "Baptist;" the man  
read off "Thomas Chris Newcomb V." "That's my son!" I shouted  at  
him. "We're agnostics!" 
     The man grinned at me,  saying, "That'll make things all the  
more interesting, won't it!" He began to laugh loudly. 
     Turning to Joe, I said, "Is THAT what you guys do for fun up  
here?"  Joe snickered but didn't say anything.  We left the room.      
The next door read,  "New Religions." We entered to find two  men  
and  two women seated around a very large watermelon.  They  wore  
beanies  and had clothes painted on to them.  None of them seemed  
to notice our presence; I listened raptly to their conversation. 
     "How  about  this:  a group convinced that Roger  Waters  is  
Jesus returned to Earth." That was the man closest to me. 
     "Who's Roger Waters?" the other man piped up. 
     "Roger Waters," interrupted the woman on my right,  "is  the  
lead  singer  of Pink Floyd.  He is well known for his  anti-war,  
anti-drug,  anti-etc.  messages in his music.  Quite a  brilliant  
man." 
     "Right.  Let's vote.  Unanimous?  Great!  What shall we name  
it?" 
     "How about `The Waters People'?" 
     "No, no. How about `Roger Waters? Jesus CHRIST!'" 
     "I like that one." 
     "Ditto." 
     "Okay.  On  to the next one.  This  group believes that Phil 
Donahue  is the anti-christ,  grape jelly is evil,  and that  all  
dogs are atheists. In addition, they refuse to eat `Twinkies' and  
`Kellogg's Rice Krispies...'" We left at this point. 
     The color of the corridor had changed subtly, and now glowed  
with  a  faint blue luminescence.  Dull lines of  gold  slithered  
along the surface of the walls,  traveling down the length of the  
corridor  to  disappear in the twilight  far  ahead.  I  wondered  
abstractedly  why  the story had taken such a  descriptive  turn.  
Author must be a real boob, I concluded. 
     Joe offered some information.  "We are now entering the home  
of  the gods." Must've been a tour guide at Disneyland before,  I  
mused. 
     "Wait  a minute." A sudden thought had struck me.  "I  don't  
believe in any of these people. How am I supposed to see them?" 
     Joe paused and thought hard.  "Oh,  yeah.  Here.  This  will  
allow you to see them." He gave me a dun-colored leg-warmer. 
     "What do I do with it?" I asked, confused. 
     Joe grinned maliciously.  "Put it on your..." Pause.  "Leg,"  
he finished sedately. 
     Wearing  the leg-warmer,  feeling totally foolish,  I  again  
started down the corridor, filled with anxiety and wonder. 
     We finally reached a door. On it, engraved in white letters: 
                               God 
                              Jesus 
                         The Holy Ghost 
     Joe  opened the door,  and I saw Him.  All three of Him were  
sitting around a table,  playing poker with Himselves.  What drew  
my attention, however, was God's remarkable resemblance to Alfred  
E.  Neuman. I whispered this quietly to Joe, who replied that the  
leg-warmer  tended to distort looks somewhat.  Suddenly  God  sat  
back and cried out, "Damn! I lost again! Jesus Christ!" 
     "Yes?" Jesus looked up from across the table. 
     "Sorry  about  that,"  God apologized to  Himself.  We  left  
before they noticed us. 
     The next door bore the legend,  BUDDAH. Joe cautiously eased  
the door open,  and we both looked in. Buddah sat cross-legged in  
the middle of the floor, his eyes closed and a smile on his face.  
Joe  crept silently up to him and yelled,  "BOO!" Then  he  added  
playfully, "Dah." 
     Buddah  opened  his eyes and stared at my  guide.  "Did  you  
bring the pizza I ordered?" 
     "Oops,  forgot.  Hold on." He disappeared for a few seconds,  
and I was left uncomfortably alone with the god, who looked a bit  
like Fred Flintstone.  Joe suddenly reappeared.  "Here it is.  No  
anchovies, right?" 
     "Right."  He turned to me.  "You mortals may not be good for  
much, but you sure make a mean pizza!" 
     We exited and Joe asked, "Anyone else you'd like to see?" 
     I thought for a moment and replied slowly,  "I always wanted  
to meet Aphrodite. Possible?" 
     Joe laughed. "Of course. Nothing like a bit of human lust to  
make  things interesting." We walked a few hundred more feet down  
that  incredible corridor,  and finally came to a door  with  the  
goddess's  name  on  it.   Before  entering,  Joe  cautioned  me,  
"Remember.  Look  but  don't touch.  Keep in mind that  you're  a  
scummy  mortal." My heart began to pound as he turned the  handle  
and opened the door with deliberate slowness. I could finally see  
into the room,  and what I saw almost made me faint.  Twenty feet  
in  front  of me stood the Greek goddess  of  love,  beauty,  and  
passion,  her back to us.  What had shocked me,  however, was the  
fact  that she was completely naked.  Joe stood next to  me,  his  
mouth  hanging open,  and looking very silly indeed.  She  turned  
around  and regarded us with an enticing smile.  Her smile  never  
changed  as the door slammed shut in our faces,  knocking us back  
into the corridor. 
     "Holy s---," I muttered, still in a state of shock. 
     Joe  nodded  jerkily in agreement.  He shook  his  head  and  
looked at me. "Jesus CHRIST!" he exclaimed in an awed voice. 
     "WHAT?"  that familiar voice echoed down the walls from  the  
corridor behind us. 
     "SORRY!" Joe called out.  He looked at me again.  "Jeez, but  
you're a lucky guy!" 
     I gulped and nodded, still staring stupidly at the door with  
the name "Venus" on it. For ten minutes we just lay there, trying  
to  recover  our  breath and letting our hearts slow  down  to  a  
paltry hundred and twenty beats per minute. 
     Eventually Joe sat up. "Seen enough?" 
     "Yes.  God, yes. Let's go." We suddenly appeared in the huge  
white hall again. The line was still there. 
     I  slipped the leg-warmer off and handed it back to him.  He  
tossed it into a corner, where it lay in a dun-colored heap. 
     Joe gestured with an air of wishing to wrap things  up,  and  
spoke  briskly.  "Well,  you're  dead.  Where do you want to  go?  
You're the only person ever to get a choice; don't blow it." 
     I thought for a moment.  "How about if I stay here and  work  
for you guys?" 
     Joe considered this.  "Yeah,  I guess you could do that. You  
wanna  be an escort?  The Heaven escort gets to wear a red  Devil  
suit  and  scare  the Hell out of people,  if you'll  pardon  the  
expression.  The  Hell  escort wears a white  robe...in  general,  
you'd really get to mess with people's minds. What do you say?" 
     "Hmmm.  I was never really into that stuff. What else do you  
have?" 
     "You could have my job!" he said brightly. 
     "What IS your job, anyway?" 
     "I was hired about 800 years ago to act as a tour guide  for  
you. They didn't know when you were coming, so they decided to be  
prepared. Anyway, that's what I do. Well?" 
     "Oh, sure. What else?" 
     Joe rattled off several more odd jobs,  none of which really  
sounded  appealing.  After my twelfth "No" he got frustrated  and  
snapped, "What do you want to do? Oh..." Understanding struck him  
and he gave me a sidelong look. "I know what you want to do." 
     I  grinned and he lowered his voice  conspiratorially.  "You  
know,  I  think we might just be able to arrange that.  Sure  you  
could handle it, though?" 
     "Mmmm..."  My eyes glazed over as I contemplated  it.  "What  
the heck!" 
     Joe laughed, saying, "Let's go." 
     We  were back in the strangely-colored corridor.  We  walked  
down  it,  laughing and talking,  until a familiar door appeared.  
"You let me do the talking," Joe warned.  "In fact,  you stay out  
here." 
     He slipped inside the door while I waited anxiously outside.  
After several minutes he came out.  "It took some finageling, but  
I've got it all arranged.  She's kind of excited,  though, at the  
thought of finally having some furniture." He winked.  "Have fun,  
kid." 
     With  that  he opened the door,  and  for  the  second,  but  
certainly not the last,  time I saw Aphrodite.  I stepped in, and  
Joe closed the door behind me. Aphrodite spoke, her perfect voice  
sending blizzards up and down my spine. "Footstool." 
     I knelt down in front of her; she sat on the bed and put her  
delicate  feet on my back.  "Good." Again the electrical storm in  
my spine; I thought I might never get used to that voice. 
     I was furniture.  I was the luckiest guy ever.
