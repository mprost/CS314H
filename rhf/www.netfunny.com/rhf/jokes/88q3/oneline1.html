<PRE>Editors Note:

	Here it is folks, the oneliner file.  Over the past year, I have
	received several short submissions that were mildly funny, but
	not quite good enough or topical enough to merit their own posting.
	I have collected them all for you, and it's time to flush the
	buffer.  These vary in quality quite a bit, and are not rated.

	Please don't take this as an invitation to send me your own
	favourite one liners.  There are thousands of these things in
	the world, and I don't have time to sift through them except on
	an infrequent basis.  Remember, one joke per submission.

	My advice is to read this file slowly if you can, one joke at a
	time.  Oneliner jokes are often ruined if read together in
	a bunch.

them up, assembled them for the first time, or something like that...]

o Weiler's Law: Nothing is impossible for the man who doesn't have to
do it himself(or doesn't know any better).

advance.

always be at least 5 times the time needed by the secretary to do 
the job.
