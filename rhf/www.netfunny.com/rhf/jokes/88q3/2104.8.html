When Mrs. Ghandi went to Moscow, Khrushchev took her for a 
tour of the city in his limo. Recalling his visit to India, 
He started giving her a hard time about the sanitary 
conditions there. 
<P>
"When I was in Delhi, I saw human excrement lying 
everywhere." 
<P>
Poor Mrs. Ghandi was terribly embarrassed, but only for 
a moment, because just ahead was a man sitting on his 
heels, shitting on the side of the road. She pointed this 
out. 
<P>
Khrushchev was livid and didn't hesitate: "Driver, get 
out immediately and shoot that man!" 
<P>
The driver got out, walked up to the man with his gun 
drawn, spoke briefly, and then returned to the car. 
<P>
"Sir, I can't shoot that man, he's the Indian ambassador."
