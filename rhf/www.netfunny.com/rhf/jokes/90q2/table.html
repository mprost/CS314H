I work as a systems administrator, and part of my job involves 
answering questions about computers.  I generally like my job, but 
sometimes it gets on my nerves.  When people ask me what I find so 
irritating, this is what I tell them: 
<P>
Imagine that you are a salesperson for Ikea (substitute "furniture 
store" if you don't know what "Ikea" is).  You get a phone call that 
goes like this. 
<P>
Customer:  I'd like to buy a kitchen table. 
<P>
You:       That's fine; we have many styles of kitchen tables, I'm 
sure you can find one you like. 
<P>
C: I need one that's 3 feet by 5 feet and has a butcher block top. 
<P>
Y: Yes, we have a table like that.  You can pick it up today. 
<P>
C: OK, how can I get it back to my house? 
<P>
Y: Well, it comes disassembled, so you can just put it on a roof rack. 
We can loan you a roof rack if you don't have one. 
<P>
C: But how do I get there? 
<P>
Y: We're just off exit 25 of the Turnpike.  Where are you coming from? 
<P>
C: Wait, wait, you're going way too fast for me.  I have a Toyota 
Celica in my driveway, and the keys are in my hand.  What do I do 
next? 
<P>
- And, whatever you say at this point, the response is always the 
same: 
<P>
C: But all I want is a kitchen table!  Why does it have to be so 
*COMPLICATED*! 
<P>
If anyone from EE is reading, I'm not describing you. 
<P>
