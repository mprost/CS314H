<P>
The current situation in Lithuania reminded me of something I composed 
a while ago to send to a friend, perhaps it will be humorous to some 
of you.  The terminology is authentic, names have been changed to protect...: 
<P>
Comrades, 
<P>
Your nation has been selected as a recipient of our fraternal assistance 
plan for socially oppressed third-world countries.  We recognize the plight 
of our brother countries in their struggle against revaunchism, reactionary 
forces, and insidious cosmopolitanism, and stand ever-vigilant, ready to take 
the vanguard in this global mission.  Our party will help you guard 
against dangerous enemies, both internal and external, as you build 
communism for your future generations. 
<P>
We have helped other countries 
like yours in casting off external forces of capitalist imperialism and 
crushing petty-bourgeois nationalist movements that are stirred up 
by the enemies of the people from within.  We have selected your country 
because of its prominent position in the world struggle and have decided 
to render the assistance within the week. 
<P>
Let it be understood that 
all those who oppose us oppose progress; those who support us toil 
towards the establishment of a workers' paradise; and as our father/comrade 
proclaimed: Those who are not with us are against us. 
<P>
We hope that you 
will take advantage of our generous offer when our forces begin arriving 
next week to crush the capitalist serpent that is choking the life of the 
proletariat in your homeland.  Comrades, let us both stand together 
at this historic moment, let our cadres help your cadres, let the 
strength of the motherland prevail against your enemies, and let us 
hope that our relationship is an eternal and productive one. 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Mail before midnight Moscow time! 
<P>
 []  Yes, I am excited by your offer of fraternal assistance in this, our 
darkest hour of ideological need.  Please send your workers' forces 
to deliver us from the imperialist onslaught and correct any deviations 
from the road to socialism. 
<P>
 []  No, we do not need an invasion right now.  We are not interested in 
the slaughter you propose and have no desire to construct communism 
at this time.  Please remember that our country is populated by 
religious fanatics who would gladly ream your bolshevik behinds 
just as in Afghanistan.  However, we might be interested next year 
if our foreign aid package from the West does not come through due 
to our extensive human rights abuses. 
<P>
