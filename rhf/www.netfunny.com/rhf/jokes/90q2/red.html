[ Another Scottish joke ] 
<P>
Red Adair walked into an Aberdonian pub after two weeks spent putting 
out a fire in a North Sea oil well. He ordered a pint of heavy and 
found a table. The man sitting next to him immediately noticed that 
this rugged-looking elderly fellow was indeed an American and said: 
<P>
"I've been to the States myself, you know. I went there last year." 
<P>
"Oh really..." our oil rig hero said in a rather tired voice. 
<P>
"Aye, I spent a month in California. One night I went to a concert 
with a famous country singer called Benny Rogers, and..." 
<P>
"Surely you must mean KENNY Rogers," Red said, looking at the ceiling. 
<P>
"Aye, that's right. Anyway, he sang a duet with a bonnie lass 
called Polly Darton." 
<P>
"It's DOLLY PARTON, not Polly Darton."  Red was not in the friendliest 
of moods now. 
<P>
The Scot realized that he was making a fool of himself and tried a 
change of topic: 
<P>
"Haven't I seen you on TV?  You're quite famous, aren't you?" 
<P>
This made old Red cheer up: 
<P>
"Indeed you have. I'm Red Adair!" he said with a grin. 
<P>
"Red Adair?! The REAL Red Adair? So, are you still married to Ginger 
Rogers?" 
<P>
