Our secretary heard this during a talent show at a retirement village. 
<P>
A retirement village decided to hold a Singles Dance, at which this 
very sweet 90-year-old gentleman met a very sweet 90-year-old lady, 
and they danced and talked and laughed, and just hit it off great. 
<P>
They continued to see each other for a while and enjoyed each other 
so much, and danced so well together, etc., that they decided to 
get married. 
<P>
On their wedding night, they went to bed and he reached over and took her 
hand and squeezed it, and she squeezed his hand back, and they went to 
sleep. 
<P>
On the second night, when they went to bed, he reached over and 
squeezed her hand, and she squeezed his hand back, and they went to sleep. 
<P>
On the third night, he reached over and took her hand, and she said, "Not 
tonight, honey, I have a headache." 
<P>
