<H4>Bidding - Additional Requirements</H4>
<P>
<H4>Section 1A - The Truth</H4>
<P>
The requirements of Division 01 and of those documents under bidding 
requirements and conditions of the contract and anything else we don't 
think looks good here is null and void.  If you know what's good for 
you, you'd read this real close (meaning the contractor). 
<P>
1.1  The work we did is clearly showed in the attached plans and 
specifications.  Our engineer, whose had plenty of college, spent one 
hell of a lot of time when he drawed up these here plans and 
specifications, but nobody can think of everything. 
<P>
Once your bid is in - that's it, brother.  From then on, anything 
wanted by our engineer, or any of his friends, or anybody else (except 
the contractor) shall be considered as showed, specified or implied 
and shall be provided by the contractor without no expense to nobody, 
but himself (meaning the contractor). 
<P>
1.2  If the work is did without no expense to the contractor, then the 
work will be took down and did again until the extra expense to the 
contractor is satisfactory to our engineer. 
<P>
1.3  Our engineer's plans is right as drawed.  If sumthin is drawed 
wrong, it shall be discovered by the contractor, corrected, and did 
right at no extra expense to us.  It won't cut no ice with us or our 
engineer if you point out any mistakes our engineer has drawed.  If 
you do, it will be one hell of a long time before you do any more work 
for us or him (meaning the engineer). 
<P>
1.4 The contractor is not supposed to make fun of our engineer, his 
plans, or the kind of work we're having did.  If he does, it's 
just too bad for him (meaning the contractor). 
<P>
1.5  Any contractor walking around the jobs with a smile on his face is 
subject to the review of his bid. 
<P>
1.6  If the contractor don't find all our engineer's mistakes before 
he bids the job, or if the contractor ain't got enough sense to know 
that our engineer is going to think up a bunch of new stuff that's 
going to have to be did before the job is complete, then it's just too 
bad for him (meaning the contractor).

I got this from my father, a number of years ago, and it still 
seems appropriate!
