Joe Blow the aspiring young executive was late for an 
appointment and in the process of doubling the speed limit 
in his BMW when a VW beetle pulled out in front of him.  He 
could not slow down fast enough and slammed into the beetle. 
Surprisingly, the BMW was totaled while the beetle was in good 
shape.  The driver of the compact was amused at the condition 
of the two cars. 
<P>
The exec was so enraged that he had a hard time keeping 
from attacking the driver of the VW.  The exec drew a large 
circle on the ground off to one side. 
<P>
He said, "You get in that circle and stay there, or I'm 
going to beat the shit out of you!"  The exec got a tire iron 
out of his trunk and smashed the windshield of the beetle. 
The man in the circle just smiled.  The exec just got madder 
and madder.  He smashed the headlights and tail lights.  When 
he looked back, the other man was snickering to himself.  This 
so infuriated the exec that he smashed in the hood of the 
beetle.  The other man was laughing so hard that he could 
barely stand up. 
<P>
Unable to stand any more, the frustrated exec tromped away. 
About this time a fellow in a pick up truck pulled up and offered 
the VW driver a ride.  "What are you laughing about?  He just 
trashed your car." 
<P>
"Yeah," the other man replied, "but I snuck outside of 
that circle three times."
