(Heard this from a friend, source unknown) 
<P>
A young boy was playing in the backyard when his father saw him stepping on 
flowers and pulling out plants. 
<P>
"Just for that," he said, "you don't get anything made out of flour for 
a week!" 
<P>
The boy was upset and walked away.  A short while later, the father looked 
through the window and saw the boy hitting butterflies with his tennis 
racquet in the garden.  He went running outside and yelled, "Just for that, 
you naughty boy, you don't get any butter for one month!" 
<P>
Later that day, the boy's mother came home in a really bad mood and as 
soon as she saw a couple of cockroaches in the kitchen, she started stepping 
on them.  The young lad looked up at his father and whispered, "Well, are 
you going to tell her or will I?" 
<P>
