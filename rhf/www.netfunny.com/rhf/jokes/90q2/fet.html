Here's an interesting view of the management-worker interface, obviously sent 
from a denizen of the unbearable white heat of the leading edge of the 
technicological revolution.  Whatever that is. 
<P>
The Field-Effectiveness Transistor (FET) is a four-terminal, depletion- 
mode device shown schematically in Fig. 1

  Figure 1   Basic Structure of the FET. 
<P>
As you can see, the device acts basically as a switch; when the influence 
of MGMT is removed, a conductive path is established between SALES and 
CUST on the MKTG substrate.  A negative input from MGMT causes resistance 
to build in the conductive channel.  SALES and CUST are isolated from 
each other and from MKTG, and all three end up floating.  This tends to 
have a second-order feedback effect on MGMT, but does not materially 
change the device's behavior.  The effect of a positive input from MGMT 
has not been observed and is not known. 
<P>
The MGMT input is shown on the schematic as a "pipeline" rather than as 
a single pin.  This is due to an effect which causes signals from MGMT 
to strongly affect the other three pins, but prevents any signal 
transmission in the reverse direction.  Physicists have labeled this 
the "Shit-Flowing-Downhill effect," after the research team at Solid 
State University which first described the phenomenon. 
<P>
The Field-Effectiveness Transistor has a wide variety of applications, 
especially in the surveillance electronics industry, where it is used 
for isolation, data encryption and as a noise source.  It is also used 
in nuclear detonators and marital aids.
