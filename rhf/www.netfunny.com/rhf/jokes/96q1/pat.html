American Presidential candidate.  When reading these, I'm sure you'll sense
a particular theme.

Subject: Pat Buchanan's Staff

CNN reported this afternoon that there was apparently NO truth to
the rumor that Pat Buchanan's Campaign staff had been blacklisted

cutting eye holes in their pillowcases &amp; sheets.

Subject: Take my car... Please!

I recently saw a "rolling oxymoron:"

A car passed me on the highway and from nearly any angle I could see
a "Buchanan For President" sticker on the car.  It was a Subaru.

From The Oregonian of Portland, Oregon:

Republican presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan has announced he is in
favor of mandatory school uniforms: black boots and brown shirts.
