<PRE>I thought this was funny sixty years ago.  I haven't the slightest idea
where it came from, I read it in a joke book.

This good samaritan was walking home late one night when he came upon this
drunk on the sidewalk.  Wanting to help, he asked the drunk "do you live
here?"  "Yep".  "Would you like me to help you upstairs?" "Yep".  When they
got up on the second floor he asked "Is this your floor?"  Yep.  

Then he got to thinking that maybe he didn't want to face the man's irate
wife because she may think he was the one who got the man drunk.  So, he
opened the first door he came to and shoved him through it, then went back
downstairs.  But lo and behold when he went back outside, there was another
drunk.  So he asked that drunk "Do you live here?"  "Yep".  "Would you like
me to help you upstairs?"   "Yep".  So he did and put him in the same door
with the first drunk.  Then went back downstairs.  Where, to his surprize,
there was another drunk.  So he started over to him.  But before he got to
him, the drunk staggered over to a policeman and cried "For God's sake,
officer, protect me from this man.  He's been doing nothing all night long
but taking me upstairs and throwing me down the elevator shaft!"
