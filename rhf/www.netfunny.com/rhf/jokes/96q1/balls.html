<P>
After the brief Falkland Islands war, a British regiment commander 
was addressing some troops under his command who had heroically 
performed above and beyond the call of duty.  He informed them 
that Her Majesty's Army had committed to reward each of the three 
soldiers 100 pounds per inch of distance between two different 
parts of the man's body. 
<P>
The commander addressed the first soldier, "Where would you like 
to be measured, Sergeant?"  "From the tip of me head to the soles 
of me feet, Sir!" he replied.  "Very good!," the commander said, 
and the sergeant was measured at 6'5."  He was paid the handsome 
sum of 7000 pounds. 
<P>
The second soldier was asked, "What about you, Corporal?"  "Between 
the tips of the fingers of me outstretched arms, Sir!" the corporal 
said. "Very good!" replied the commander.  The corporal, a man of 
considerable wingspan, was rewarded 8000 quid. 
<P>
Finally, the last soldier was addressed.  "And you, Private, where 
would you like measured?"  "From the tip of me penis to the base of 
me balls, Sir!" retorted the private.  The commander replied, "I must 
admit this is quite an unusual request, Private, but it's your 
decision."  He ordered the private to drop his pants for the ensuing 
measurement.  Immediately the general's mouth fell agape and he 
stammered, "Where in God's name are your gonads, Private?!!" 
The private proclaimed, "Goose Green, Falkland Islands, Sir!!"
