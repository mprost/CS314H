<PRE>Here's one of my favorite anecdotes from my teaching career that I like to
share with others.  It's a true story. 

One day while we were studying the solar system in my fifth-grade class one
of the students posed an intriguing question about comets.  Because I like to
show the class that learning is a fun, lifelong process, I told the young
gal, "That's an excellent question. I don't know the answer.  I wonder where
we could find out."

Her response was sincere disbelief. "You don't know? I thought teachers were
supposed to know *everything*!"

A slow grin crept over my face as I prepared to give my "learning is a
life-long process" speech.  But before I could get a word out a student from
across the room blurted out, "Yeah, but he's only a fifth-grade teacher."
