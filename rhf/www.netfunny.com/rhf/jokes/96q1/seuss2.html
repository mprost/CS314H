After months of silence, OJ finally spoke at the trial.  His words to 
Judge Ito were.. "I did not, 
could not and would not have committed this crime. 
<P>
Seems with a little help from Dr. Suess and a bit more time, he and 
Judge Ito could have 
extended this statement: 
<P>
Ito's statements in ALL CAPS... OJ's in lower case.
