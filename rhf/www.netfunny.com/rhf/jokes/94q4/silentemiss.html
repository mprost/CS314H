There was once a very prim and proper older lady who had a problem 
with passing gas.  Since she came from a generation when people didn't 
even talk about this kind of problem it took a long time for her to 
seek help.  Finally, however, she was persuaded to consult her family 
doctor. 
<P>
After she filled out all the proper forms and had waited about 20 
minutes in the waiting room the doctor called her into his office, 
leaned back in his chair, folded his hands into a steeple and asked 
her how he could help. 
<P>
"Doctor," she said, "I have a very bad gas problem."  "A gas 
problem?" replied the doctor.  "Yes.  Yesterday afternoon I had 
lunch with the Secretary of State and his wife and had six, um, er, 
ahhh... silent gas emissions.  Last night I had dinner with the 
governor and his wife and had &lt;blush&gt; four silent gas emissions. 
Then, while sitting in your waiting room I had five silent gas 
emissions!  Doctor, you've got to help me!  What can we do?" 
<P>
"Well," said the doctor thoughtfully, "I think the first thing 
we're going to do is give you a hearing test." 
<P>
