<PRE>Under the "Feedback" section of Focus on the Family, July 1994:

----

This letter was sent to U. S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders
after she announced her recent stand against smoking.

----------------

Dear Dr. Elders:

There is no sense using scare tactics to persuade kids not to smoke.  Young
people are going to smoke no matter what we do, so we might as well accept
that fact.  We would be better off instructing all our young people that
smoking is okay as long as they use a filter.  We should begin by holding
classes that teach young people the proper way to fit a cigarette with a
filter.  We could use pencils as models and have all students practice
placing a filter on a pencil.

I'm sure we'll get flack from parents who don't want their kids to smoke
under any circumstances, whether they use a filter or not.  We can
circumvent these troublemakers by instructing all school health clinics to
issue filtered cigarettes to any student who asks for them -- regardless if
they have permission from their parents.

Since kids are starting to smoke at earlier and earlier ages, we should
start this education process in kindergarten so we make sure every child has
the proper information to experience this whenever he or she desires to do
so.  We might as well teach them how to smoke in the safest way possible.
