The following is NOT original to me but I managed to obtain a copy of it. 
No clue who the original author is. 
<P>
Requisite knowledge required: This reply template is designed for use 
in a VAXnotes (or "Notes") conference, but it's easily understandable to 
the Usenet community.  If you know about VAXnotes conferencing, you can 
skip the rest of this paragraph. For those whose sites have declined to 
purchase this excellent package from our fine company, it is a kind of 
like a combination between Usenet newsgroups and thread-based BBS systems. 
<P>
It is a messaging system where messages (called "notes") are kept in a 
single indexed file (a "conference") on a central node and accessed via 
a client/server protocol by machines throughout the network.  Notes are 
organized by numbered "topics," which consist of a "base note" and one 
or more numbered "replies," which are accessed hierarchically (not in a 
flat address space like Usenet).  Notes can be moved to different topic 
numbers or reply numbers, deleted, or set hidden ("/HIDDEN"), and topics 
can be locked against further replies ("/NOWRITE"). ! 
<P>
Posters often use cute "personal names" which follow their email address 
in the note header (virtually no one uses their real name; usually people 
use short, witty sayings, puns, or other phrases). Notes and replies are 
numbered incrementally; when these numbers reach a round number, it is 
popular to race to claim that number for one's topic or reply. This is 
called a "snarf." (For example, note 10000.0 might simply read, 
"** SNARF! **") Oh, and at least here in Digital, Notes is considered of 
superior quality to Usenet by many.  Naturally, within Digital, Notes is 
very popular; we have a large number of various Notes conferences, which 
are used for both official and unofficial employee communication. 
<P>
Without further ado, I introduce the humor.
