"Government should be run like a business."  We've all 
heard that chestnut.  Here is how the Internal Revenue 
Service (nobody's favorite government agency) would be 
like, if only it were run like Microsoft Corp. (a 
successful private enterprise). 
<P>
<!--  bullets-->
<UL><LI>The IRS, as always, announces new tax forms will be 
mailed the week before the new year.  However it will 
follow Microsoft's example and actually ship them the 
following May. 
<LI>Responding to pressure from some large corporations and 
a users' group, some early copies of the tax forms will 
actually be released in March.  The recipients must 
sign non-disclosure agreements. 
<LI>In June, the forms will be recalled because the IRS 
loses a suit for appropriating some other country's 
intellectual property. 
<LI>When you move, the IRS will continue to send mail to 
your previous address forevermore, just like Microsoft 
sends its product upgrade notices. 
<LI>When you upgrade from form 1040 EZ to 1040 A, and then 
to 1040, you will pay an upgrade fee each time.  Also 
you need to send in a new registration card and get a 
new Social Security Number.  In order to upgrade, you 
have to submit the original first page of your previous 
year's form. 
<LI>Like Microsoft, when you file a late or amended tax 
return the IRS will reject it on the grounds that the 
the prior year is no longer supported. 
<LI>The IRS telephone help will remain similar to 
Microsoft's, staffed by ill-trained, high-turnover 
personnel who sometimes give a correct answer, but 
the IRS will have to discontinue using a toll-free 
phone number. 
<LI>After struggling with reams of dense documentation of 
complex options and rules, you discover that you will 
need publication 3297, with a ten-word-long title, in 
order to answer (you hope) a single obscure question. 
The IRS, like Microsoft, will charge a minimum of $40 
for that publication. 
<LI>The IRS, like Microsoft, will continue to issue 
immense volumes of bug fixes, interpretations, and 
clarifications.  However the tax-rule updates should 
be neither easily searchable nor well-indexed. 
<LI>Instead of three-ring binders containing complete sets 
of tax code bugs and interpretations, IRS rulings will 
be promulgated in a haphazard fashion by individual 
taxpayers via BBS, Usenet, and Compuserve.  A for- 
profit publishing subsidiary would also be nice. 
<LI>The new all-powerful (and eccentric) Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue will jet around the country giving 
speeches and granting numerous interviews, but only 
to sycophantic reporters.  Changes to the tax code 
will be at the whim of the Commissioner and largely 
kept secret until they are published.
