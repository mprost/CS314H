<PRE>
A cruise ship founders on a reef, and a man just manages to swim some
miles and crawl up on a desert island.  After recovering from the
ordeal, he begins to explore and finds to his great surprise (and
pleasure) that the only other survivor of this terrible tragedy is
Christie Brinkley (or fill in the blank...)

They build a lean-to and find some food and water.  After a few weeks,
it becomes clear that help is not on the way, so they start to get
intimate.  The guy is clearly ecstatic for a couple of weeks, but one
morning she awakes to find him moping under a tree.

"What's the matter?" she says, "Is there anything I can do?"

"Well, I am a little shy about asking you," he replies, "But could you
take some of that charcoal from the fire and paint a mustache on your
face?"

"A mustache?  Well....I....I suppose so", and she does it.

"Now," he says, "There's just one other thing.  Can I call you Bob?"

"Bob?  Well...if it will make you feel better...all right."

"Great!" he cries, looks at her and says, "Bob! You're _never gonna
believe_ who I'm fucking!"
