This was sent to me by a workmate, who got it from a friend, from a
friend... (you know the story).

In a forest, a fox bumped into a little rabbit, and said,
 "Hi Junior, what are you up to?"
"I'm writing a dissertation on how rabbits eat foxes" said the rabbit.
"Come now friend rabbit, you know thats impossible!"
"Well, follow me and I'll show you"
They both go into the rabbits dwellings and after a while the rabbit
emerges with a satisfied expression on his face.

Along comes a wolf.
"Hello, what are you doing these days?"
"I'm writing the second chapter of my thesis, on how rabbits devour
wolves."
"Are you crazy! Where is your academic honesty?"
"Come with me and I'll show you."
As before the rabbit comes out with a satisfied expression on his face
and with a diploma in his paw.

Finally, the camera pans to the rabbits cave and as everybody should have
guessed by now, we see a mean looking, huge lion sitting next to some
bloody and furry remnants of the wolf and the fox.

The moral: its not the contents of your thesis that is important, its
your supervisor that really counts!!
