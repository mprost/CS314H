RELIABILITY PREDICTION USING ALTERNATIVE METHODS* 
<P>
1. INTRODUCTION 
<P>
1.1   Alternative methods may be used for predicting 
reliability, when approved by the Project Manager. 
This section outlines these methods and the 
conditions under which they may be applied. 
<P>
2. METHODS 
2.1  The alternative methods covered by this section 
are: 
<P>
(a) Crystal ball 
(b) Astrological 
(c) Wet finger 
(d) Miscellaneous techniques (Tarot cards, ouija 
boards, etc.) 
(e) Witchcraft 
These will be discussed, in turn. 
<P>
2.2  Crystal ball Crystal balls may be used, if 
operated by qualified personnel. Qualified personnel 
include gypsies and other operators approved by 
NATO AQAP-1, and reliability engineers in AQAP- 
1 approved companies. Crystal balls must be 
calibrated against master standards in accordance 
with AQAP-6. 
<P>
2.3 Astrology Astrological prediction methods may 
be used, but only as applied by AQAP-1 approved 
astrological scientists. Use of astrological data from 
daily newspapers, etc., is not acceptable, as these do 
not necessarily meet approval criteria and are not 
traceable. 
For astrological predictions, the dates of 
birth of the following must be provided: 
<P>
(a) Project managers (MOD and supplier) 
(b) Senior reliability engineer 
(c) Chief designer 
(d) Secretaries of above, if they are evaluated as 
likely to affect attitudes, motivation and 
performance. 
(e) All the people who will make any part of the 
system. ( These data are only required when 
prediction accuracy of better than 0.001 percent 
is required). 
<P>
2.4 Wet finger This is a simple and popular method, 
particularly among project managers. Since little 
expertise is required, it is a low-cost method. It 
features some of the disadvantages of the witchcraft 
methods (see below), but the secondary effects are 
less unpredictable, particularly if the personnel 
making the predictions are replaced or forget what 
the prediction was. 
<P>
2.5 Miscellaneous methods Other methods may be 
used, e.g. Tarot cards, ouija boards, tea leaves, etc., 
but only by qualified staff or consultants approved 
as above. In any case, appropriate data must be 
provided as required by the operator. 
<P>
2.6 Witchcraft Witchcraft may be used. However, 
this method of prediction is a reliability forcing 
process, rather than a prediction. Great care must be 
exercised to ensure that only achievable, 
conservative MTBF values are forced in this way, 
since death, serious injury, or madness can result if 
personnel observe failures or running times which 
lead to MTBFs different to the set values. 
There are no defence or Military standards 
for witches, so operator selection is difficult. It is 
advisable to employ one or more witches on a 
project, preferably as part of the reliability team, if 
this method is to be used. However, care must be 
exercised to ensure that they confine their powers to 
the reliability requirement. 
Security clearance can sometimes present further 
difficulties, particularly for non- NATO 
practitioners such as witch doctors, obeah men 
voodoo priests, etc. 
Note: Secretaries should not be asked to 
perform these rites, even when appearance indicate 
likely competence. 
<P>
3. PREDICTION ACCURACY 
3.1  These alternative methods described generally 
provide much more accurate reliability predictions 
than the other techniques described in this standard, 
e.g. MIL-HDBK-217E. In most cases individual 
failure events, not merely MTBFs, can be predicted, 
if appropriate resources are applied.
