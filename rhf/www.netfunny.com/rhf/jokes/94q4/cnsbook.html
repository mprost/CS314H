Q: Emily, how can I put out my billboard on the information superhighway? 
<P>
A: The best way to do it is to perform a spam.  It's called that because 
everybody loves it as much as the customer in the Monty Python "Spam" 
sketch loves his spam. 
<P>
The best way to do this is to find some naive programmer and ask it to 
write a script that posts your message to every newsgroup.  You'll start 
by getting as big a list of newsgroups as you can find.  The members of 
USENET, hoping to see your ad, have prepared these lists just for you. 
It doesn't really matter what your product is.  If people on the net might 
use it, they'll be happy to read about it in every group. 
<P>
Now create a message promoting yourself.  Be bold, be daring, and be 
sure to provide info on how to contact you in ways that people on the 
net can't shut off.  (More on that later.) 
<P>
Because the reaction is going to be so overwhelming, be sure to take 
the following steps: 
<P>
a) Unlist your phone number.  The networking public is going to want 
to contact you so much to talk about your product or service that they'll 
even try to call you at home.  If they get your home phone or address, 
they'll be sure to share it with all the other people seeking to send 
you their admiration, and your fame may prove too much.  You want business, 
of course, but do you want to take orders all night? 
<P>
b) Get an account with some other internet account providers.  For 
reasons not quite certain, your provider probably has a clause in 
their contract with you saying not to do this.  Even if they don't, 
they will probably delete your account a few hours after you announce 
your product, so be sure to get other accounts under assumed names 
so you can follow what's going on.   This is the reason that expecting 
E-mail replies to your ad won't work. 
<P>
c) Be sure you've led a clean life.  You and your product are going 
to become as famous as Gary Hart and O.J. Simpson!  But, as you know, 
such fame has its downsides, as your eager fans research every tawdry 
episode from your past history.  So be sure there are no skeletons in 
your closet.  (Unless your product is skeletons!)  Of course, since 
you're no net-communist, you probably have had a clean life. 
<P>
d) Due to the Brady Bill, you may want to file your firearms acquisition 
permit a few days in advance of your ad.  Soon you're going to be rich, 
and you'll need to protect that wealth. 
<P>
e) Load plenty of fax paper in your fax machine.  Hire extra staff to 
load the rolls.  There may be orders in all the faxes you will get. 
<P>
f) Resign any memberships you may have in any professional associations 
you may have joined relating to your business that might have something 
as pesky as a code of ethics.  Why put them through the trouble of handling 
all the calls from your adoring fans, looking for somebody to talk with 
about you. 
<P>
Ok, now you're ready.  Unleash the posting program.  Have it send your 
message once to every group.  There are thousands.  Now picture in your 
mind the prospective customer.  She starts her day, perhaps, reading 
a group about her hobby.  And right there is your ad!  The title is 
curious so she reads it.   Your name is now inserted into her mind--you've 
got mindshare.  It's true your product didn't have anything to do with 
her hobby, but the net is there to find customers for you, not for 
people to share their thoughts. 
<P>
Then she goes to her next group, perhaps about her brand of computer. 
There's your ad again!  You've sneaked into the great demographics of the 
high-tech world.  As she goes on, she sees your ad again and again. 
Imagine her joy as she sees your now familiar headline everywhere she 
goes.  "Wow, they must be really big and important," she'll think. 
"They're as famous as IBM." Soon that joy will be so much that she'll 
be ready to buy, buy, buy. 
<P>
Now comes the bad news.  USENET is unreliable, and postings don't always 
work.  So, for unknown reasons, a few hours after you make your postings 
they will all have disappeared.  Normally you would just post them again, 
but by this time your internet mail access will have been deleted, as I 
said above, so you'll have to just sit back and bask in the adulation and 
orders.  There is a theory that some people, who don't like your ad, 
will have a smarter program than your posting program root around the net 
and stamp it out, but I hardly think it's likely anybody would do that. 
<P>
There will be some people annoyed, it's true.  But the net has at least 
10 million people on it, and you'll probably only <B>really</B> annoy perhaps 
3 to 4 million of them--a minority! 
<P>
Others who have tried this have reported not only that a mere minority 
show displeasure, but that vast numbers of people take the time to send 
back inquiries and orders just so you can have more to read.  Unfortunately, 
they rarely actually pay.  Some theorize that those in the vocal minority 
who don't like you are sending in pretend positive responses, to waste your 
time.   Who would bother to do that?  Perhaps just 1% out of the 3 to 
4 million annoyed people, at most.  That shouldn't bother you too much. 
A similar percentage may try to phone you, or fax you, or send bricks 
postage due, or subscribe you to magazines.  Ignore them.  They're just 
40,000 or so of the lunatic fringe, communist element you find on the net. 
They're just upset because you're making money and they're not.  In fact, 
suckers that they are, they actually ended up paying to transmit your 
ad everywhere.   Learn to ignore them.  (That's not advice, it's just 
something you'll have to do.) 
<P>
Now at this point you probably have to stop answering your phone, but keep 
those faxes coming in, and of course get ready for the mail.  If you 
ever do get to see some of the E-mail you got sent--wow, what a flood! 
<P>
When it settles a bit, threaten to sue anybody who didn't like you.  That 
should put some fear of God into them.  They should have known better than 
to build a system so open.  Sure, they built the network as a cooperative 
effort, but if they didn't want your ads, why didn't they put in protections 
against them or enact laws to stop them?  What you did was probably legal, 
so what's their complaint?   They're like people who leave their keys in 
their cars and whine when they get stolen.  Really, like they didn't 
deserve it.  They just don't see the wonderful new purpose to which their 
network can be put, to help small, exciting firms like yours get famous. 
That's the American dream, after all, and you're living it, or will, when 
the time comes to come back out of your bunker and reconnect your 
phones.
