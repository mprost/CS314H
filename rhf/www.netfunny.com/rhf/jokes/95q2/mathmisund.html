THIRTEEN MISUNDERSTANDINGS<BR>

HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS<BR>

<P>
In the interest of historical accuracy let it be known that 
....

<!--  list-->
<OL><LI>Fibonacci's daughter was not named "Bunny." 
<LI>Michael Rolle was not Danish, and did not call his 
daughter "Tootsie." 
<LI>William Horner was not called "Little-Jack" by his 
friends. 
<LI>The "G" in G. Peano does not stand for "grand." 
<LI>Rene Descartes' middle name is not "push." 
<LI>Isaac Barrow's middle name is not "wheel." 
<LI>There is no such place as the University of Wis-cosine, 
and if there was, the motto of their mathematics 
department would not be "Secant ye shall find." 
<LI>Although Euler is pronounced oil-er, it does not follow 
that Euclid is pronounced oi-clid. 
<LI>Franklin D. Roosevelt never said, "The only thing we have 
to sphere is sphere itself." 
<LI>Fibonacci is not a shortened form of the Italian name that 
is actually spelled: F i bb ooo nnnnn aaaaaaaa 
ccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii. 
<LI>It is true that August Mobius was a difficult and 
opinionated man. But he was not so rigid that he could 
only see one side to every question. 
<LI>It is true that Johannes Kepler had an uphill struggle 
in explaining his theory of elliptical orbits to the 
other astronomers of his time. And it is also true that 
his first attempt was a failure. But it is not true that 
after his lecture the first three questions he was asked 
were "What is elliptical?" What is an orbit?" and "What 
is a planet? 
<LI>It is true that primitive societies use only rough 
approximations for the known constants of mathematics. 
For example, the northern tribes of Alaska consider the 
ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle to 
be 3. But it is not true that the value of 3 is called 
Eskimo pi. Incidentally, the survival of these tribes is 
dependent upon government assistance, which is not always 
forthcoming. For example, the Canadian firm of Tait and 
Sons sold a stock of defective compasses to the government 
at half-price, and the government passed them onto the 
northern natives. Hence the saying among these peoples: 
"He who has a Tait's is lost."
