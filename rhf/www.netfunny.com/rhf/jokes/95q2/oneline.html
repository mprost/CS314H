Here are more snippets from the one liner file.  While preparing RHF,
I collect short jokes that aren't quite worthy of an individual posting
in the one liner file.  Every so often I put digests of these out to
the group.  (Beware that some readers, such as NN, will mistakenly
present all these items in the digest as individual articles.
Undigestification is a stupid kludge, but you have to live with it.)

These short items may contain swearing, mature themes and stereotypes.

I have known this one for as long as I can remember.

A man from Peoria has to make his first business trip, to Boston.
So he gets off the airplain in boston, collects his luggage, grabs
a cab. He tells the cabbie to take him to his hotel.
While on the way to the hotel he asks the cabbie "Where in Boston
is the best place to get scrod?"
The cabbie thinks for a moment and responds "Well sir, I've heard
it said many ways, but never in the pluperfect subjunctive".
