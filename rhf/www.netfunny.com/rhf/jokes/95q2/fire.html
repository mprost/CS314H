  One night in a sleepy town the chemical plant explodes into flames.  The 
alarm goes out and departments from miles around race to the scene.  
After fighting the fire for over an hour the chemical company president 
approaches the fire chief, "All of our secret formulas are in the vault 
in the center of the plant.  They must be saved!  I will give $50,000 to 
the engine company that brings them out safely!"
  With this the firemen attack with a renewed gusto.  Two hours later they 
still have not gained any ground.  With this the company president offers 
$100,000 to the engine company that brings out the company's secret 
files.  In the distance a lone siren is heard and soon another fire truck 
comes into sight.  The fire chief realizes that is that little rinky-dink 
volunteer fire company composed entirely of men over 65.  Much to his 
amazement the fire engine races through the chemical plant gates and drives 
right into the middle of the inferno.  He can see these old timers hopping 
off their rig and fighting the fire with an effort that he has never seen 
before.
  Less than an hour later the fire is out and the secret formulas have been
saved by this group of volunteers!  The chemical company president is so
estatic he doubles the reward to $200,000!  After thanking the volunteers
the chemical company president can't help but ask what they will do with
the reward money.  The engineer (driver) looks him right in the eye...
"First thing we do is fix the fucking brakes on that truck!"
