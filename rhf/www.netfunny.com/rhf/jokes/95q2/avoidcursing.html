<P>
It has been brought to management's attention that some individuals 
throughtout the company have been using foul language during the course of 
normal conversation with other employees.  Due to complaints received from 
some employees who are more easily offended, this type of language will no 
longer be tolerated. 
<P>
None of less we do realize the critical importance of idividuals being 
able  to properly experss their feelings when communicating with 
fellow employees.  Therefore, a list of code phrase replacements has 
been compiled so proper exchange of ideas and information can continue 
in an effective manner without risk of offending our more sensitive 
co-workers.

<PRE>     OLD PHRASE                                 PREFERED NEW PHRASE 
  
  No fucking way!                            I'm certain that's not feasible. 
  You've got to be shitting me.              Really? 
  Tell someone who gives a fuck.             Perhaps you should check with... 
  Ask me if I give a fuck.                   Of course I'm concerned. 
  It's not my fucking problem.               I wasn't involved with that  
                                             	project. 
  What the fuck?                             Interesting.              
  Fuck it, it won't work.                    I'm not sure I can implement this. 
  Why the fuck didn't you tell me that       I'll try to schedule that. 
	sooner?      
  When the fuck do you expect me to do       Perhaps I can work late. 
	this?  
  Who the fuck cares?                        Are you sure this is a problem? 
  He's get his head up his ass.              He's not familiar with the  
                                             	problem. 
  Eat shit!                                  You don't say. 
  Eat shit and die.                          Excuse me? 
  Eat shit and die motherfucker.             Excuse me Sir? 
  What the fuck do they want from my life?   They weren't happy with it? 
  Kiss my ass.                               So you'd like my help with it? 
  Fuck it, I'm on salary.                    I don't think you understand. 
  Shove it up your ass.                      I love a "challenge." 
  Who the hell died and made you the boss?   You want me to take care of  
                                             	this. 
  Blow me.                                   I see. 
  Blow yourself.                             Do you see? 
  Another fucking meeting?                   Yes, we really should discuss this. 
  I really don't give a shit.                I don't think it will be a  
                                             	problem. 
  He's a fucking prick.                      He's somewhat insensitive. 
  She's a ball-breaking bitch.               She's an aggfressive go-getter. 
  You don't know what the fuck you're doing. I think you could use more   
                                             	training. 
  This place is all fucked up.               We're a little disorganized.
