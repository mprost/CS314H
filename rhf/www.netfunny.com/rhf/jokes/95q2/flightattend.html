I wrote this for the alt.feminism newsgroup.

They didn't see the humor in it.  Maybe you will.

I was on a plane the other day and made the apparent mistake of 
addressing the stewardess as "waitress".  What happened was this:

As the stewardess was walking past, I called out "oh waitresss...", 
as I wanted another drink.  She turned red in the face, and informed me 
in no uncertain terms that she was a FLIGHT ATTENDANT, not a waitress.
  
Ok whatever says I.  As long as you're here, how about hopping over 
to the galley and fetch me a scotch.  And if it would save you a trip,
I'll have the chicken kiev, a bottle of white wine, and coffee for dinner.

I was only trying to be helpful.

She copped a real bad attitude.  Damned if I'm leaving her a tip I think 
to myself.  Sheesh.  Give these flying waitresses a fancy shmancy title 
and they go and get uppity on you.  Not only that, they don't like to be 
called "stewardess" either.  No, they are flight attendants.  And a 
flight attendants main function seems to be to serve dinner and drinks.
  
Well, they do show you how to fasten a seatbelt...so I guess that's the 
difference between a waitress and a flight attendant.  I never had a 
waitress show me how to fasten a seatbelt, although I have had a few put 
a bib on me at seafood restaurants.

The only difference between a stewardess and a flight attendant I noticed 
is that stewardesses were better looking, younger, and more attentative 
to your needs.  I never had to call a stewardess over for another drink.  
Somehow they just knew when it was time.  Very similar to a good waitress.

I wonder if the 2 waiters on the flight would have been so touchy.
