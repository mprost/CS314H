OPENING STATEMENT OF ARTHUR B. FUDDLE, ESQUIRE,<BR>
COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT<BR>
</PRE>
</center>
<P>
By Mr. Fuddle: 
<P>
Ladies and Gentleman of the jury: the opening statement you have just 
heard from Mr. Schoff on behalf of the plaintiff, Wile E. Coyote, paints an 
incomplete picture of what occurred on the occasions when Mr. Coyote claims he 
was injured by ACME products. 
<P>
The evidence will clearly show that my client, ACME Products Corp., a 
Division of Dangerously Innovative Products and Patents Incorporated (or 
"DIPPI") is not at fault in this matter, and that any injuries sustained by the 
plaintiff were clearly caused by his own negligence, assumption of the risk 
and/or misuse of the products. 
<P>
Now, we have all seen the footage on television of the plaintiff 
withstanding various injuries which appear to be caused by ACME's products. 
You have seen over and over the tape of a hapless coyote being bludgeoned by a 
boulder as he is helplessly trapped by his ACME Spring Loaded Shoes.  We have 
all seen the photographs taken at Warner Memorial Hospital of Mr. Coyote in a 
very small incubator, on life support, as his doctors attempt to straighten out 
the accordion-like folds from his body.  We have all seen the gruesome images 
of the operation in which Dr. Tazmanian D. Devil whirls like a dervish, 
obscuring his features and creating a starry, "dust cloud" effect, while 
numerous limbs holding various surgical instruments swiftly repair the nerve 
damage to Mr. Coyote's extremities. 
<P>
It is normal for any human being to feel pity, horror, and even anger 
at such images.  I want you to put those images aside for the moment, because 
they paint an incomplete picture.  What the media has not disclosed to you, and 
what you will see in this courtroom, are various attempts at murder committed 
by the plaintiff - attempts which, fortunately, failed - while using my 
client's products.  As the plaintiff readily admits, he is a predator, and his 
sole function in life is to track down and kill an innocent, highway traversing 
ornithoid. 
<P>
You see, ladies and gentleman, while the plaintiff is a natural 
predator, he is not a very good one.  His own skills were inadequate to 
complete the task at hand, so he chose to seek the aid of various devices to 
effectuate his diabolical schemes.  He looked in a catalogue, saw my client's 
products, and ordered them in the hope that they would assist him in killing 
his prey. 
<P>
But ladies and gentleman, ACME's products are not meant to cause 
intentional harm to anyone.  The plaintiff has taken what were designed as 
amusements, toys for the young and feebleminded, and has twisted their use to 
his own purposes. 
<P>
But I digress.  Let us examine the plaintiff's claims and how the 
evidence clearly refutes the proposition that ACME is responsible for any harm 
sustained by the plaintiff. 
<P>
Mr. Coyote states that on December 13 he received an ACME Rocked Sled, 
that he attempted to use said rocket sled to pursue his prey, and that, upon 
igniting the sled, it accelerated with "sudden and precipitate force as to 
stretch Mr. Coyote's forelimbs to a length of fifty feet." 
<P>
There are several reasons why ACME cannot be held responsible for any 
injuries caused by this incident.  First, the warning label attached 
conspicuously to the inside of the left front tire of the sled clearly stated, 
and I quote: "WARNING: IGNITION OF THIS DEVICE AT FULL THROTTLE MAY CAUSE 
SUDDEN AND PRECIPITATE FORCE AS TO STRETCH USER'S FORELIMBS TO A LENGTH OF UP 
TO SIXTY FEET, OR MAY CAUSE DEATH."  That the plaintiff suffered so little as a 
result of his carelessness can be attributed only to Providence. 
<P>
Second, Arizona law is clear on this point: a plaintiff who is found to 
be violating any law whose purpose is safety at the time of his injury is 
contributorily negligent *per se*.  There is ample evidence that Mr. Coyote was 
violating both the laws of gravity and inertia at the time of this incident, 
and thus he is responsible for his own woes. 
<P>
I could list many more examples of Mr. Coyote's negligent conduct in 
connection with his use of ACME's products, but you will hear all about them as 
the trial goes on.  You will also hear the following evidence: 
<P>
<!--  list-->
<OL><LI>You will hear the plaintiff himself testify that, prior to the injuries 
complained of in this accident, he has suffered numerous injuries.  As 
an example, on one occasion prior to the use of any ACME product, the 
plaintiff cornered his prey on the edge of a rather thin precipice. 
Taking an ordinary saw, the plaintiff began cutting away so that the 
edge of the cliff, with his prey on it, would drop some 1500 feet to a 
jagged, rocky destruction.  Instead, by some inexplicable twist of fate 
the edge of the cliff remained standing while the whole mountain, on 
which the plaintiff was standing, plummeted to the bottom of the 
ravine, causing numerous injuries which affect the plaintiff to this 
day. 
<LI>On another occasion, Mr. Coyote was chasing his prey and followed it 
off of the edge of a cliff onto thin air, not realizing until too late 
that his prey, a bird, could remain in the air almost indefinitely 
while he, a canine, could not.  As a result, he fell yet again, 
suffering even further severe and debilitating injuries which predate 
the injuries complained of in this action. 
<LI>You will also hear the testimony of Mr. Road Runner, the plaintiff's 
prey and the true victim in this tragedy. Mr. Runner has been forced 
to live a nomadic lifestyle as a result of Mr. Coyote's unwanted 
attention, preventing him from forming any type of long term 
relationships.  Numerous restraining orders had no effect.  Mr. Runner 
has also suffered numerous psychological problems as a result of Mr. 
Coyote's actions, including but not limited to an inability to trust 
anyone who provides him with bird seed, a necessary ingredient in his 
daily nutritional schedule. 
<LI>You will also hear from a witness to many of the incidents alleged in 
plaintiff's complaint, a colorful local prospector with red hair and 
moustache who has been known to proclaim: "No rootin' tootin' coyote 
can outsmart Yosemite Sam on any day of the week!"  Don't be fooled by 
his gruff manner and twin pearl-handled six-shooters, he's a pussycat. 
<LI>Customer service records of defendant ACME, which we were forced to 
produce in this matter, clearly show that none of the complaints 
registered by ACME's customers nation-wide have ever resulted in 
criminal convictions of the officers of the corporation. 
<LI>Finally, videotape evidence will demonstrate that plaintiff faked many 
of his injuries, setting out to create performances especially for a 
jury such as yourself.  On numerous occasions he would "mug" for the 
camera, as if he was well aware beforehand that he was being taped. 
For instance, during the "Rocked Sled" incident, as his forelimbs were 
stretched out ahead of him and his body remained behind, he looked 
straight into the camera with a forlorn, tired expression, as if to 
say: "look at how terrible my situation is, can you guess what's going 
to happen to me now."  This jury is too smart to fall for such petty 
theatrics. 
</OL>
<P>
In summary, ladies and gentlemen, it will be clear to you from the 
evidence that ACME's products, if used properly, will cause only minimal 
injuries to a user and his loved ones.  The plaintiff in this case has brought 
his troubles upon himself by adopting his carnivorous lifestyle.  As others 
have so adequately uttered: "Live by the Super Slick Jet Propulsion Automated 
Explosive Metal-Shearing Heat-Seeking Laser-Guided Razor-Edged Boomerang, die 
by the Super Slick, etc." 
<P>
I ask you, on behalf of my client, to dismiss the plaintiff's claims 
against it.
