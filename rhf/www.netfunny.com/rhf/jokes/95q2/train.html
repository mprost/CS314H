<PRE>A good friend e-mailed this to me.....


A few days after Christmas, a mother working in the 
kitchen was listening to her son playing with his new 
electric train in the living room.  She heard the train 
stop and her son said, "All of you sons of bitches who 
want off, get the hell off now, 'cause this is the last 
stop...and all of you sons of bitches who are gettin' 
on, get your asses in the train, 'cause we're leaving!" 
The mother went in and told her son, "We don't use
that kind of language in this house.  Now I want you 
to go to your room for two hours.  When you come 
out, you may play with your train.  But I want you to 
use nicer language.  Two hours later, her son came 
out of the bedroom and resumed playing with his 
train.  Soon the train stopped and the mother heard 
her son say, "All passengers who are disembarking 
the train, please remember to take all of your 
belongings with you.  We thank you for riding with us 
today and hope that you will ride with us again soon. 
For those of you just boarding, we ask that you stow 
all of your hand luggage under your seat.  Remember 
that there is no smoking except in the club car.  We 
hope that you will all have a pleasant and relaxing 
journey with us today.  For those of you who are 
pissed off because of the two hour delay, please see 
the bitch in the kitchen."
