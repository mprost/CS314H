[Note - What follows is one part of the True News Digest - a collection of
	true-life stories which didn't really warrant individual posting, but
	which are amusing nevertheless.  The digest is quite long, and it will
	appear in 22 parts over the next few months - ed.]

Subject: Gross Anatomy

	During a physiology lecture at Brandeis University, the professor drew
a picture of a female breast in cross-section so that the class could visualize
the anatomy involved in lactation.  Everybody carefully scribbled down the
crude (as in not very well drawn) picture.  Two minutes after he finished
drawing the picture, the professor suddenly realized that the milk ducts were
pointing away from the nipple!
	The amazing part is that none of the 60-odd pre-med students caught that
mistake, and the graduate students didn't catch it either!

Subject: True condom-buying experience

i'll never forget roger, the pharmacist at the neighborhood drug store when
i was getting to be old enough to buy condoms.

i walked into the store, found which shelf the condoms were on, got a box
and took them to the register.  so far, so good... i just kept telling
myself to keep a straight face and look like i bought these things all the
time.  i carried it off pretty well until the end:

       roger: here's your change and i'll grab a paper bag for you.

       me:    that's ok, i don't need a bag.

       roger: oh, you're gonna eat 'em right here in the store, eh?

Subject: Automated Traffic Reports

I live in Milwaukee, but on occasion I must drive the painful trip to
downtown Chicago for business.  While I was cruising at a top speed of
1.3 miles per hour, I decided it might be a good idea to actually tune
into one of the "TRAFFIC INFO" stations on my AM dial.

Instead of hearing a recorded voice telling me of the traffic situation
as of an hour ago, I was somewhat (and plesantly) surprised to find
they've finally managed to computerize the whole thing. It was very
similar to the kind of voice intonation encountered when telephoning
for the time.. I could hear a tiny pause (and a distinct "click") between
each of the words and/or phrases.   No doubt the entire system is
completely computerized using some sort of sensors located at key points
throughout the freeway system.   

During the recording, the following segment was broadcast, which shows
that automated systems are never what they're cracked up to be:

"As of .. four .. ten ..p.m, .. the following freeway locations are
 experiencing long delays....."      

 ... I-290.. between.. Harlem Avenue.. and.. Harlem Avenue.."

Subject: Flag it.

[I got the following from _American_Heritage_Magazine_, November 1990.]


According to the "Code of Etiquette for Display and Use of the U.S. Flag,"
which is part of Public Law 94-344:

If the U.S. flag falls into a condition that makes it "no longer a fitting 
emblem for display," it must be "destroyed in a dignified way, preferably
by burning in private."

Subject: Hard Times

I had never realized the extent of the deprivation of basic
necessities experienced by poor factory workers during the
Industrial Revolution until I read the following in my History
textbook:
 
"A family of six or ten might live in a single dark, airless room."

Apparently air was affordable only by the wealthy factory owners.
Presumably conditions improved when the owners found that workers
performed better when able to breathe.

Subject: Can you tell me...

Heard this on TV a while back:

Two grocery clerks, a guy and a girl, are stocking the shelves in the
personal hygiene section.  The guy is busily stacking up toothpaste tubes
when the girl comes to a box of Summer's Eve.  She looks around, but can't
figure out where it belongs on the shelves.  So she walks up to the guy
with a bottle in hand and says

   "can you tell me where this goes?"

Subject: Quick, Harry, change the sign!!


I'm ancient enough to have grown up in an all-white neighborhood.  A couple
miles from my house was a building supply company that was very proud to
have been in business since the turn of the century, and they had a motto
painted on the side of their building to that effect.

When the neighborhood finally began to integrate, this company very quickly
changed their motto.

And what was this motto that they discarded after all these years?

	"We sold your grandfather."

Subject: Why is business so slow?

From the Boulder (Colorado) Daily Camera newspaper, a few years back.  
Posted in the Services Offered category.  The ad ran for about a year.

   "Can't read?  Illiterate?  Call me for professional reading lessons.  
    Chris, 443-xxxx"

I wonder how many phone calls Chris received ...

A true story:

I was in a restaurant quite some time ago, and asked the
waitress for a half-liter of the house wine.  She replied
that they only sold the wine in full liters, but she then
pointed out that "Our liters are kind of small!"  

(The wine arrived in a standard 750ml bottle.)

friends.  A neighbor came by to admire the baby, and asked, "But what will
you do when she gets older and starts speaking Korean?"

Subject: City lighting (true story)

 As a seasonal gesture Derby City Council decided to install some
festive lights in the streets, and they managed to arrange to
buy some second-hand from Cleethorpes, a town about 100 miles
away. The workmen put up the fancy lighting, although they didn't
have time to test it before switching it on for the big occasion.
As a result motorists entering Derby wondered how they could
have become so lost as to be greeted by an enormous message in
festive lights: Welcome to Cleethorpes!

Subject: Phony numbers

	After receiving a stream of harassing telephone calls, my sister
had her phone number changed.

	Several weeks later, at 3:00 in the morning, her telephone rang.
"Did you know," the caller inquired, "that your telephone number spells
EAT-MINE??  &lt;SLAM!&gt;"

	Now at 3:00 in the morning, one's brain is not completely
functional.  Angry and half-asleep, my sister called the telephone operator
to complain.  "I just had my number changed to avoid obscene phone calls,"
she screamed, "and now you've given me an obscene phone NUMBER!!!"

Subject: Do the BBC know where the war is?

Heard on Radio 4 17/1/91:
"The Prime Minister speaking there after the outbreak of hostilities
outside No 10 Downing Street."
And I thought Iraq was a few thou miles away!

Also in the same builletin, an American radio reporter:
"Obviously I've never been there, but it feels like Hell itself."
Whaddya mean, obviously? 8-)
