In France and Italy, people seduce each other. 
<P>
In Brazil, they don't have seduction, they just have sex, and 
are laid back about it in a way many uptight Englanders might 
find loose-moraled. 
<P>
In Sweden, they don't have seduction either.  Any sex that may 
occur usually happens during a discussion on Third World debt, or 
the ozone layer, or something equally mind-broadening.  Any 
attempt to seduce a Swede will result in a patronising lecture 
on safe sex. 
<P>
In Singapore, they don't have seduction either.  Ordinary people live 
in towering government-built apartment blocks, most of which have 
a social committee which receives funding from Singapore's 
government to throw parties to get the socially inept technocrats 
to socialise and marry and have children to make more Chinese than 
Malays and Indians (who have a higher birth rate).  For the same 
reason, the National University of Singapore's Engineering faculty 
is built next to the Accounting department, so the male engineers 
meet the female accountants, get married, and have Chinese children. 
<P>
South of Harlem and north of downtown Manhattan, and either 
side of midtown, is where the rich whites live, and where 
half the people are too busy to even think about something as 
frivolous as romance, while the other half are too busy seeing 
their shrinks because they can't find romance.  Anyone they do 
meet faces a barrage of questions about their career paths, 
medical insurance plans, and past drug and divorce offenses. 
<P>
People who live in Connecticut and upstate New York, who commute to 
Manhattan every day (so-called "mainline snobs" because they 
never use the subway) seduce each other on the train home, 
where they scope each other out on the train for a few days, 
then strike up a conversation a couple of minutes before one 
of them gets off (so that if the other person 
is an asshole, the conversation will shortly end anyway) and 
arrange a lunch date back in Manhattan.  This ensures that 
rich professional mainline snobs mix with other rich professionals. 
<P>
Near (but not in) Washington D.C., in the neighbouring suburbs in 
Maryland and across the river in Virginia, the first thing single 
people talk about having met an attractive potential partner 
is politics.  Tax-and-spend liberals won't go out with 
Dickensian conservatives, gun nuts won't touch screaming 
heart civil libertarians, lobbiests for oil companies won't 
date lobbiests for clean air, and all the fine shades of political 
opinion are more important than opinions about anything else, 
physical attractiveness, intellectual prowess, and personality. 
<P>
In Germany, people can talk about their emotions up-front and 
realistically. 
<P>
<PRE>   SCENE:   Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany 
   Helmut:  So Hans, how is Helga these days? 
   Hans:    Helga says that unless I stop sleeping around  
            and spend more time at home, she's going to  
            leave me and contest custody of the kids. 
   Helmut:  I think Helga has a point - if you really loved  
            her, you wouldn't pay for Eva's flat.  
   Hans:    The first few years with Helga were great,  
            but I really don't love her any more.  
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
People from other cultures find this Teutonic efficiency a little 
bloodless and dehumanised, as if they discuss their emotions 
like they discuss their shopping list, or desired options in 
their new Opel. 
<P>
In most of Australia, people are afraid to say what they think, 
for fear of offending someone else and for someone else hurting 
them.  Instead, they talk about safe trivialities. 
<P>
<PRE>   SCENE:   Kensington, NSW 
   Warren:  So Harry, how is Janet these days? 
   Harry:   She's been very strange lately. [Tense] 
   Warren:  Oh? [Nervous tone of voice] 
   Harry:   Yeah.   
   Warren:  [Changing the subject]  How's the new Falcon? 
   Harry:   It's alright, but typical Australian-made stuff.... 
</PRE><P>
</PRE><P>
Foreigners are shocked to find that the only way to seduce an 
Australian is to pretend to be almost completely disinterested. 
Any show of romantic interest will cause the 
non-risk-taking Australian to go scurrying of to their friends 
for security.  Any effort to be warm, caring, and supportive 
to an Australian woman will cause her to reciprocate only because 
she thinks you must be gay, and thus free of emotional risks. 
<P>
